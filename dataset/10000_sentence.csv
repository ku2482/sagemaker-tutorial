RDIJS7QYB6XNR,excellent!!
RDIJS7QYB6XNR,!
R36ED1U38IELG8,great quality wooden track better than some others we have tried.
R36ED1U38IELG8,perfect match to the various vintages of thomas track that we already have.
R36ED1U38IELG8,"there is enough track here to have fun and get creative incorporating your key pieces with track splits, loops and bends."
R1UE3RPRGCOLD,cards are not as big as pictured.
R298788GS6I901,my daughter loved it and i liked the price and it came to me rather than shopping with a ton of people around me.
R298788GS6I901,amazon is the best way to shop!
RNX4EXOBBPN5,do not buy these!
RNX4EXOBBPN5,they break very fast i spun then for 15 minutes and the end flew off dont waste your money.
RNX4EXOBBPN5,they are made from cheap plastic and have cracks in them.
RNX4EXOBBPN5,buy the poi balls they work a lot better if you only have limited funds.
R3BPETL222LMIM,great item.
R3BPETL222LMIM,"pictures pop thru and add detail as ""painted."""
R3BPETL222LMIM,pictures dry and it can be repainted.
R3SORMPJZO3F2J,"to keep together, had to use crazy glue."
R2RDOJQ0WBZCF6,i was pleased with the product.
R2B8VBEPB4YEZ7,children like it
R1CB783I7B0U52,showed up not how its shown .
R1CB783I7B0U52,was someones old toy.
R1CB783I7B0U52,with paint on it.
R2D90RQQ3V8LH,really liked these.
R2D90RQQ3V8LH,"they were a little larger than i thought, but still fun."
R1Y4ZOUGFMJ327,nice huge balloon!
R1Y4ZOUGFMJ327,"had my local grocery store fill it up for a very small fee, it was totally worth it!"
R2BUV9QJI2A00X,great deal
RSUHRJFJIRB3Z,as advertised
R1T96CG98BBA15,comes w a 15$ servo so expect to spend 150 more on a good servo immediately be the stock one breaks right away
R2ATXF4QQ30YW,awesome !
R2ATXF4QQ30YW,thanks!
R1YS3DS218NNMD,i got this item for me and my son to play around with.
R1YS3DS218NNMD,the closest relevance i have to items like these is while in the army i was trained in the camera rc bots.
R1YS3DS218NNMD,this thing is awesome we tested the range and got somewhere close to 50 yards without an issue.
R1YS3DS218NNMD,getting the controls is a bit tricky at first but after about twenty minutes you get the feel for it.
R1YS3DS218NNMD,the drone comes just about fly ready you just have to sync the controller.
R1YS3DS218NNMD,i am definitely a fan of the drones now.
R1YS3DS218NNMD,only concern i have is maybe a little more silent but other than that great buy.disclaimer i received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.
R2SDXLTLF92O0H,it was a birthday present for my grandson and he loves it!
R2SDXLTLF92O0H,!
R4R337CCDWLNG,got a wrong product from amazon vine and unable to provide a good review.
R4R337CCDWLNG,"we received a pair of cute girls gloves and a baseball ball instead, while we were expecting a boys batting tee."
R4R337CCDWLNG,"the gloves are cute, however made for at least 6 yrs or above...more likely 89 yrs old girls.cant provide a fair review as we were not able to use the product."
R32Z6UA4S5Q630,you need expansion packs 35 if you want access to the player aids for the factions expansion.
R32Z6UA4S5Q630,the base game of alien frontiers just plays so much smoother than adding factions with the expansion packs.
R32Z6UA4S5Q630,all this will do is pigeonhole you into a certain path to victory.
R1H1HOVB44808I,awesome customer service and a cool little drone!
R1H1HOVB44808I,especially for the price!
R4UVQIRZ5T1FM,i got these for my daughters for plane trip.
R4UVQIRZ5T1FM,i liked that the zipper pouch was attached for markers.
R4UVQIRZ5T1FM,"however, that pouch fell off."
R4UVQIRZ5T1FM,but the girls have loved coloring their own stickers.
R4UVQIRZ5T1FM,would def buy this again.
R226K8IJLRPTIR,my girlfriend and i are both into yoga and i gave her a set of the yoga joes for her new home yoga room.
R226K8IJLRPTIR,"when she saw them, she was impressed that i had found little green army men like her brother used to play with."
R226K8IJLRPTIR,then she realized they were doing yoga and she almost exploded with delight.
R226K8IJLRPTIR,you should have seen the look on her face.
R226K8IJLRPTIR,"needless to say, the gift was a huge hit."
R226K8IJLRPTIR,they are absolutely brilliant!
R3031Q42BKAN7J,i like it but i absoloutely hate that some dolls dont have pets like this one so im not stoked and i really would have liked to see her pet
R44NP0QG6E98W,we have many wow toys in our home.
R44NP0QG6E98W,we love how well they are made.
R44NP0QG6E98W,the advent calendar is an exception.
R44NP0QG6E98W,the plastic is thinner than our other wow toys and the barn animals wont even stand up on their own due to the head weighing more than the body and uneven base of the toy.
R44NP0QG6E98W,very disappointing when we love the concept.
R44NP0QG6E98W,the story to read along with everyday is great.
R44NP0QG6E98W,"i would have preferred quality and would have paid more for it instead of a cheap ""knockoff"" of the rest of their toy line."
R44NP0QG6E98W,"it is very obvious by the weight of the toys sloppy paint jobs which items in our ""wow toys"" bin are part advent calendar vs. the rest of the toys we have."
R44NP0QG6E98W,"also there is a lot of overlap between the wow town advent calendar & winter wonderland calendar, which makes me want to look for alternatives for this years advent calendar options."
R24VKWVWUMV3M3,tons of fun
R2MW3TEBPWKENS,love it great add to collecton
R3N01IESYEYW01,exactly as described.
R3N01IESYEYW01,fits my 7yr old well!
RKLAK7EPEG5S6,purchased these legos to help aid me with teaching my sunday school class.
RKLAK7EPEG5S6,the children loved them and best part was that it helped the children remember past lessons.
RKLAK7EPEG5S6,the true lego brand seem to worksnap togetherfit together better than the generic brands.
RKLAK7EPEG5S6,plus i had some lego snobs in my class that only would use the real lego brand and shunned the generic brand.
RKLAK7EPEG5S6,only wish legos were a little cheaper but you get what you pay for and i would recommend for quality to purchase this set.
R1HOJ5GOA2JWM0,"its ok, but not as good as the old bite meez puppets."
R1HOJ5GOA2JWM0,this puppet is very thin.
R1HOJ5GOA2JWM0,my little yorkie often bites my hands right through the stuffing.
R1HOJ5GOA2JWM0,it not durable enough to really play with.
RO5VL1EAPX6O3,this was to be a gift for my husband for our new pool.
RO5VL1EAPX6O3,did not receive the color i ordered but most of all after only one month of use not continuously the mesh pulled away from the material and the inflatable side.
RO5VL1EAPX6O3,completely shredded and no longer of use.
RO5VL1EAPX6O3,it was stored properly and was not kept outside or in the pool.
RO5VL1EAPX6O3,"poorly made, better off going to wm and getting something on clearance."
R3OSJU70OIBWVE,"ended up sending this guy back because i didnt need it, but ive bought one in the past and loved it"
R3NFZZCJSROBT4,"the product is good, but the box was broken."
R47XBGQFP039N,"works well ,quality product but this style of board will charge multiple batteries at the same time safely  if  all batteries are of the same cell count , the same battery composition  lipo, nimhetc  and they must have individual cell voltages that are very close and equal to each battery connected at the same time ."
R47XBGQFP039N,"when board is connected to most if not all chargers it can only read total and individual cell voltage of one of the batteries and may over or under charge the others to some degree , total rate of charge is divided equally between batteries connected at the same time ."
R47XBGQFP039N,close monitoring is a must when using like all high discharge batteies .
R47XBGQFP039N,i have only personally expeienced one lipo battery meltdown and it is a very short if not non existant window of opperunity to prevent or minimise the colatteral damage once the process starts .
R47XBGQFP039N,read and understand all charging and battery instructions .
R1JS8G26X4RM2G,great gift!
R1ORWPFQ9EDYA0,we play this game quite a bit with friends.
R1YIX4SO32U0GT,fits my $20 bill perfectly.
R1W3QQZ8JKECCI,i ordered these for my 3 year old sons birthday party as party favors.
R1W3QQZ8JKECCI,they were a huge hit & the perfect fit for a 3 year old!
RZX17JIYIPAR,these paper lanterns are adorable!
RZX17JIYIPAR,"the colors are bright, the patterns are fun & trendy & theyre a good size!"
RZX17JIYIPAR,"they came well packaged & are easy to assemble, theyre also really easy to take apart & flatten back down!"
RZX17JIYIPAR,well get to use them for a few halloweens im sure!
RZX17JIYIPAR,they even came with the string needed to hang!
RZX17JIYIPAR,"im glad i grabbed them, theyre really cute, my kids are excited to add to the halloween decor & are already asking to hang them!i received this item at a discount for my unbiased review."
RIDVQ4P3WJR42,my grandson loves these cards.
RIDVQ4P3WJR42,thank you
R1WQ3ME3JAG2O1,received a pineapple rather than the advertised smore
RNTPOUDQIICBF,christmas gift for 6yr
R3AHZWWOL0IAV0,my grandson loves these cards.
R3AHZWWOL0IAV0,thank you
R3PDXKS9O2Z20B,"even though both of my kids are at the top of this age recommendation level, they love this game!"
R3PDXKS9O2Z20B,i love how it caters to the kinesthetic learner by asking them to move their bodies into the shape of the letters.
R3PDXKS9O2Z20B,it even takes teamwork as sometimes two people are required to finish the letter.
R3PDXKS9O2Z20B,"my kids know all of their letter sounds and shapes, but this didnt stop them from playing the game over and over."
R23URALWA7IHWL,my 5 year old son loves this.
R36L8VKT9ZSUY6,love it
R23JRQR6VMY4TV,absolutely one of the best traps in the game.
R23JRQR6VMY4TV,it is never a dead and always live since you can always pay half your lifepoints for its cost.
R23JRQR6VMY4TV,its main power is that it can stop any card.
R23JRQR6VMY4TV,hopefully this card comes off the forbiddenlimited list soon.
R3T73PQZZ9F6GT,really soft and cute
R300I65NW30Y19,baby loved it  so attractive and very nice
R3MDVG6RXZ0KC4,everyone loves this old classic toys
R4SB75QT541TT,my daughter loves this little thing.
R4SB75QT541TT,"one part hello kitty, one part bat, you cant go wrong."
R1AHKUFBO1S7V3,much bigger than expected.
R1AHKUFBO1S7V3,wish they had our other grandchildrens names.
R2YLG0UT0NQ25C,as advertised
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,catan is my husbands favorite game.
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,we play all the time.
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,"due to many of our resource cards being damaged or missing, i hopped onto amazon to look for a replacement deck."
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,"while searching, i came across these tokens."
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,who knew?!?!
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,i was not aware a product like this existed.
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,"on a whim, i bought a pack.... and im soooo glad i did!"
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,everyone loved playing with the lil tokens.
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,"call me crazy... but i think the game is just more fun when you are using a miniature sheep for a sheep, a miniature wood for a wood, etc... instead of plain ole cards."
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,it was easy.
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,we each kept our pieces in a small nonseethrough cup during play you can also play with your resources visible to all.
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,not to mention... they were just a fraction of the price of the replacement deck i was going to buy online!
R1ML50QVMAEHIA,we are very happy with our purchase.
R3AF8I3RA6OBXV,"grand kids love them, came on time"
R25XLQ0A2OZZDJ,my grandson lives in this  soo cute
R1YM5I20A1C04H,my boys love it
R9W9VDJ261CJO,for the price its a great costume piece.
R9W9VDJ261CJO,a lot darker hair than i thought it would have in it.
RUDU6BWZ4OH39,my soon to be 4 year old loves this thing...its holding up fine
R1BBJDI7Z3AJW2,show those muscles.
R1BBJDI7Z3AJW2,great statue.
R8SCUAIH17RS6,my son loves it!
R8SCUAIH17RS6,he wouldnt put it down for the first couple weeks he had it.
R8SCUAIH17RS6,id say that this toy got my 3 year olds stamp of approval.
R275YVJ9LD4BP9,daughter is very happy
R3AIM61BUJQQ0B,this toy is sure to keep a kid who loves tools happy.
R3AIM61BUJQQ0B,it is a tool box that can be taken apart and put back together with the supplied tools.
R3AIM61BUJQQ0B,this toy is designed to teach shapes and colors with fun songs.
R3AIM61BUJQQ0B,it comes apart easily and might be a bit frustrating for a younger toddler.
R3AIM61BUJQQ0B,a slightly older child will enjoy the challenge of taking apart and reassembling this toy.
R2LR9ME8LO75JC,i bought this product for my kids birthday.
R2LR9ME8LO75JC,it saved me lot of time in blowing all the balloons.
R2LR9ME8LO75JC,"air flow is really good....there is touch on option too along with continuous nozzle..i used it for 1hr, it is working fine."
R2LR9ME8LO75JC,nice product....
RCUSMINLNGF62,"amazing quality first of all, these cards are amazing proxies but dont try to use em in ""official duels"" unless a judge is okay with it, if you have the real thing to show and look amazing in your binder!"
R3G16P80BE17NB,very good item.
R3G16P80BE17NB,quick delivery.
R1LL4GHZL1ASXX,this was much too small for an average size child to bounce on.
R1LL4GHZL1ASXX,it was the size of about a punching balloon.
R1LL4GHZL1ASXX,very disappointing.
R21IFNI7NHX7NX,we have this track and another one that glows in the dark we combine them and make a giant track.
R21IFNI7NHX7NX,lots of fun my 4 year old directs me on what he needs built and we have all kinds of fun with it
R23LFYAIMTUMQK,loses its ability to lengthen and shorten quickly as it gets little bends in the grooves.
R1KVF9YJQWIXNF,my grandson loves having good guys vs bad guys
R2NZ654DZ2EO3U,these are exactly what you would expect...large crayons.
R2NZ654DZ2EO3U,crayola is definitely the leader of the pack when it comes to crayons.
R2NZ654DZ2EO3U,i purchased these for my 2 year old.
R2NZ654DZ2EO3U,she is learning to write and draw and these fit in her hands much more comfortably than standard sized crayons.
R2NZ654DZ2EO3U,with these being thicker they are harder for her to break too lol.
R2NZ654DZ2EO3U,bonus.
R2NZ654DZ2EO3U,overall these are great crayons and i highly recommend them.
RY1L296RT1IU7,very nice doll
R1XNDG83B0DYNY,dont buy this.
R1XNDG83B0DYNY,cheaply made.
R1XNDG83B0DYNY,hippos get stuck.
R1XNDG83B0DYNY,"cover for ball storage does not attach securely to the underside of game so every time they pick it up, the cover falls off and balls go everywhere."
R1XNDG83B0DYNY,cant believe this game actually passed qc standards.
R1XNDG83B0DYNY,you would think it was a 99 cent game.
R30BROIV4HG62F,i very much liked this product.
R30BROIV4HG62F,"however, when i opened it the packaging said 18ml instead of 30ml."
R30BROIV4HG62F,"besides that, i really liked this paint."
R1KZULMFF0V7XN,great toy hiogh quality voice changer is great
R1A84GM7K4GZVW,throws really well and is well made.
R1A84GM7K4GZVW,the nose is a bit hard and it hurt my 5 year old a few times when he didnt make the catch and got bumped in the face.
R16HYMDSG70RLL,i think the figure itself looks great.
R16HYMDSG70RLL,"but these are typically for a collector, and the package was bent and frayed at the edges."
R16HYMDSG70RLL,i expected a little more care with the packaging.
R29NU5NNRYRCUU,not so good
R16N0A77B9KDEJ,the grandchildren were here this past weekend so this game was fully tested and enjoyed.
R16N0A77B9KDEJ,2 boys  1 girl ages 3  7. a nice variety of games with different skill levels.
R16N0A77B9KDEJ,we learned very quickly that we needed an additional controller so that was purchased asap.
R16N0A77B9KDEJ,the little ones loved showing off their counting talents but the older one grew bored with the play after his first turn.
R16N0A77B9KDEJ,&34too much like school nana&34.
R16N0A77B9KDEJ,i like that the 3 year olds will grow with the game.
R16N0A77B9KDEJ,"i would not recommend it for kids at the top of the age range though as it doesnt seem to hold their interest very long.a side note  after playing the game we had to break out the movie and watch for the umpteenth time but we are not complaining, we all love the movie."
R1HMJ6ZZTUF61I,i loved it and my boyfriend really loves it.
R39J1Q52NAROW0,we have enjoyed this game with many families and many game nights!!
R39J1Q52NAROW0,the directions are right on the soft mat and the dice dont roll off the table!
R1U82K6FVR06I6,these were great.
R1U82K6FVR06I6,i put them in swag bags for my sons birthday party.
R1U82K6FVR06I6,what a hit!
R2OQ1U2U4VLRRU,love it
R2568BBU7YS4P3,good
R14HBGUHLFMFWQ,they are so pretty!
R14HBGUHLFMFWQ,made the photo booth fun
RT460RKZ7P3CN,its always a fun game to have not to much else to say.
R2JI8MRXXJ8OT1,they worked out great for our lego themed birthday party.
R1DY07ESOYT953,ok
R8ZIRG91LGELG,"does the job, but very lackluster in presentation."
R8ZIRG91LGELG,ordered it for a gift and was a little embarrassed at how plain it was so we bought some extra odds and ends to make a more presentable gift.
R1ZT28IR5WUCGN,"true to all the other letter factory games and videos, this reinforces letters over and over."
R1ZT28IR5WUCGN,"i was hoping for a bit more gaming in this game, but it is mostly just lettersgreat for a kid who needs to learn them like my three year old."
R1ZT28IR5WUCGN,theres a game where you practice tracing the letter but we sometimes have trouble using the lightstick so we didnt play it.
R1ZT28IR5WUCGN,its also meant more for multiplayer so make sure you have more than one controller.
R1ZT28IR5WUCGN,"overall, a really great app for kids who need to work on their letters!"
R2BBNSRU017A2A,this is a quality product.
RKU0PB54OAG3R,"works as advertised, grandkids love it, in this case the wand should have a little less power or range."
RKU0PB54OAG3R,when they are any where in the same room out goes off.
R2SZVQGP4D1JSR,"game arrived in timely manner, in good condition."
R2SZVQGP4D1JSR,it is a very fun game!
R2SZVQGP4D1JSR,were very satisfied!
R3G0PSPB3ESRYV,perfect and came in time.
R1N679JHQ46HU1,"for the price, then game is awesome for a 3 yearold!"
R1N679JHQ46HU1,mine loves it.
R1N679JHQ46HU1,"be prepared to want to shoot yourself in the head after playing it for the umpteenth time in a row, but fun enough to entertain a preschooler though would get boring pretty fast for an older child."
R1N679JHQ46HU1,gameplay is simple enough to allow for young kiddos to play independently of an adult if that is an option for you!
R1N679JHQ46HU1,"for like the $56 i paid for it, the game is interchangeable for just cheap but pretty sturdy pirate toys even recycle the sword into a safe, lightweight halloween costume accessory, so worth the price on that note alone."
R1N679JHQ46HU1,"on the one hand, i love that the map which you cant really see in the picture is also a bag to hold the game, but wouldve preferred that the game packaging was reusable as a box as the map gets ""deformed"" by stuffing all the pieces in it and becomes somewhat of a pain to use as the flat playing surface necessary for the game especially if you are not interested in pulling the little plastic stands off the treasure pieces every time which i imagine would also decrease the life of the pieces."
R1N679JHQ46HU1,"this is of course easily solved by say putting it all in a gallon or bigger sized ziplock, or another box you have around, especially if youd like it to stack nicely with your other games, but since i had to chuck all the packaging, would have been less wasteful if it was reusable."
R1N679JHQ46HU1,"overall, a fun and inexpensive game for the younger set which can be made super simple or a bit more challenging depending on how serious you are about hiding the treasure, and fun gamepirateplay pieces just dont lose them!."
RZ4BGNK7ANKN1,she had to wear two at a time.
RZ4BGNK7ANKN1,skimpy.
R1S2FSIFFHP9UK,"my granddaughter, who is 18 months old, loves this ""book"" as she calls it."
R1S2FSIFFHP9UK,it will entertain her so nana can sit and breathe for a minute.
R7JZ6KG7O37T7,love it
R12XOI2Z6XA00H,"item is good, however, could be better."
R12XOI2Z6XA00H,"would like to see the option to upgrade to battery operated eyes....as they are great and present a focal point..this was a gift, and the recepient liked the cat.thank you!"
R2K1MWOYN7ULHY,had these in my home for several years.
R2K1MWOYN7ULHY,got tons of use for all ages.
R2K1MWOYN7ULHY,very fun!
R17DWDKFDJE2RG,as expected
RRYKM3YJFLDTF,they come with so many fun colors.
RRYKM3YJFLDTF,they even had a few glittery ones which my daughter loved.
RRYKM3YJFLDTF,its a very good variety and they are good crayons.
R2G09RG85UL4IE,misrepresentation of their products per pictures.
R2G09RG85UL4IE,"i didnt read the description closely, but they listed the item as a single model, however showed the picture of a battlegroup which included the model questioned."
R2G09RG85UL4IE,pretty shady if you ask me.
R2JK4DYJ6NWEG0,great product!!!
R2JK4DYJ6NWEG0,fast shipping!
R2JK4DYJ6NWEG0,!
ROP6ITXO8K5V2,"great cube, moves and twists easily."
ROP6ITXO8K5V2,"it may seem costly, but its worth every penny."
R1OJ5VF140BAIS,well worth the 17$!
R1OJ5VF140BAIS,i got around 4 different bills of a ton of different countries!
R1OJ5VF140BAIS,even a 500 million zimbabwe note!
R1OJ5VF140BAIS,i am ordering two more for gifts.
R1OJ5VF140BAIS,"im an 26 year old college student in austin, tx."
RGSPBHQI09FIU,it was a birthday present for my grandson and he loves it!!
RGSPBHQI09FIU,i think daddy likes it too!
RGSPBHQI09FIU,!
R8SJ5Y8THOFSK,the food is a messy nightmare  the packet kind and when you make your own.
R8SJ5Y8THOFSK,consider having a feeding spot because it stained tile grout and the carpet.daughter loves it  but honestly it drives me nuts.
R8SJ5Y8THOFSK,constantly talks saying the same few lines.
R8SJ5Y8THOFSK,i make my own food and juice for it and just use premie diapers.
R8SJ5Y8THOFSK,saves a ton of $$$
RREQMGRSNDXCS,"this deck is great, every card works well with one another and what makes it better is that you could edited the deck."
RREQMGRSNDXCS,"for me i turned it into a vampire deck using the same traps and magic cards, so far, i havent lost."
R3I4VB5SHG9REB,great buy
R3OWWKZAPLMLTF,"fun game to play...not so fun to get all of the ""bad"" chips."
R2E895GI0HS6H6,very difficult to inflate.
R2E895GI0HS6H6,the valves are designed for beach balls not big recliners.
R2E895GI0HS6H6,totally disappointed.
R2E895GI0HS6H6,dont waste your money
R2UUYIRPLBPG9A,"these packs are so overpriced for what you get, and you need packs 35 if you want access to the player aids for the factions expansion."
R2UUYIRPLBPG9A,the base game of alien frontiers just plays so much smoother than adding factions with these expansion packs.
R12ZM5BERC327K,good seller.
R12ZM5BERC327K,everything was as described and prices well.
R12ZM5BERC327K,shipping was also fast.

R39K66RSWNHEUX,i just love them for my collection!
R2IFXPR0VM5UZZ,came early  way early.

R3TQ9HOI4SGLKE,"really cute doll, nice quality, cute clothes, 11 y.o."
R3TQ9HOI4SGLKE,daughter loves it oin my opinion the american girls dolls are seriously over priced and absolutely do not offer any superior quality oer the madame alexander dolls.
R3TQ9HOI4SGLKE,"it reminds me of the cabbage patch kids craze when folks would pay hundreds for those, only difference is that they had no competition of any sort, whereas the american girl dolls have tons of competition with other dolls of same size, idea, and quality."
R3TQ9HOI4SGLKE,the madame alexander dolls are a prime example.this doll is really cute and my daughter really likes her.
R3TQ9HOI4SGLKE,"she says that the doll is cute, her outfit is cute and she especially loves the boots, she has 23 other madame alexander dolls plus 2 of the springfield collection dolls sold at michaels craft stores  cute but there are differences that make them obviously less expensively made than the madame alexander & american girls."
R3TQ9HOI4SGLKE,"she loves all her dolls and in fact has stated several times that she thinks the madame alexander dolls are &34cuter and have more personality&34 than the american girl dolls.summary cute, good quality doll, good buy"

R3V2Y9NU2GKN0M,it has so many activities for him to choose from and he especially seems to like the steering wheel.
R3V2Y9NU2GKN0M,"although we havent used it other than on the table, if you have a younger child that isnt standing yet you can take the play top off and set it on the floor."
R3V2Y9NU2GKN0M,"it does require 2 aa batteries, although the demo ones that came in it worked well for a couple days to start with."
R3V2Y9NU2GKN0M,"overall for the price its a really good activity table, especially if you get it for a child around 6 months because it will grow with them."

R3NOZHLQF2AHJQ,these safari characters arent the best quality rubber ducks of all the rubber ducks ive seen.
R3NOZHLQF2AHJQ,they are fairly cheaply made.
R3NOZHLQF2AHJQ,the material is very thin with imperfections in the texture at the base of the ducks.
R3NOZHLQF2AHJQ,the colors do not appear as vibrant as they appear in the photo.
R3NOZHLQF2AHJQ,the printed designs are not evenly painted and look as though they may wash off in a couple uses.

R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,the pictures and brush are great.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,"but, it should not be in a spiral form."
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,for several reasons.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,first..2 kids cannot share at the same time...one could use a paint brush and water...but cant because they are bound together.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,takes forever to dry again because they are bound together.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,i ended up cutting the spiral off so i would have loose pages that can be shared and dry easily.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,instead of a spiral.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,they should have a single hole punch in the top left corner.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,use a plastic reclisable ring to hold the pages together after they are dry or for transporting.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,otherwise it is sweet.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,my 5 and 3 year old grand boys love the pictures and the water brush.
R1BOHU2N4DQDZT,no mess.

R1YDJ7SWL15IJZ,we love our elves!i received this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.
R1YDJ7SWL15IJZ,my thoughts are 100 my own!
R38Q40T2T00IOG,be prepared for some very explicit cards.
R38Q40T2T00IOG,we did eliminate some before playing.
R38Q40T2T00IOG,our ages range from late 30s and up.
R38Q40T2T00IOG,plays like apples to apples with very adult questionanswer cards.
R38Q40T2T00IOG,fun game but just a word of caution
R1XKCO5MFYYFH6,grandsons loved it.
R1XKCO5MFYYFH6,they stayed in a cabin in branson so they really connected with the cabin.
R1Q7PLVQX130Z3,great to play with the glider castle.
R1Q7PLVQX130Z3,they role well down the ramps
RRZBY0TG1D5SW,daughter loved them
R2TA99A4TD314Y,"came early, very cute."
R2TA99A4TD314Y,came in package from china so 6 year old nephew very impressed that black yoshi came so far.
R2TA99A4TD314Y,he looked at the globe so he knew how far that was and that was fun.
R2TA99A4TD314Y,very cute.
R2TA99A4TD314Y,very fun and no shipping charges.
R2TA99A4TD314Y,that made me very happy
R2GIM1UKH7VLMA,was a gift for a 10 year old grandson and after scooting around on the garage floor for a while learning to control it on the ground he took off and flew it around.
R2GIM1UKH7VLMA,id call it a success.
R1JICJ4UM63WZ3,children like it
R2UU0IC1KW8VTR,this product works fine to charge my daughters redcat racing truck.
R2UU0IC1KW8VTR,"unfortunately, this is the third one we have purchased."
R2UU0IC1KW8VTR,they tend to come apart at the end that connects to the rc car.
R2PIBF4UOOBWTI,its in perfect condition no rips or anything its super soft and adorable.it took about three weeks to arrive.it is way bigger than i ever expected which is a plus.would definitely recommend to any togepi fan.
R29R7A5I3895DR,"i love the poseability of this kit, and the build is fantastic and fun."
R29R7A5I3895DR,this would be a 5star kit had they used separate white plastic parts for the upper part of the wings.
R29R7A5I3895DR,"instead, they went with very complicated stickers that do not hold on well."
R17V30QKHMD6RT,super cute!
R17V30QKHMD6RT,"a wonderful item, just as described."
R1IEWX2AYY7H09,cute and just right.
R1IEWX2AYY7H09,thank you.
R2XR00UBJHHIMA,when i 1st received this doll i was disappointed in her small size.
R2XR00UBJHHIMA,i gave her as a present to my 2 year old granddaughter and it is her favorite one!
R2XR00UBJHHIMA,maybe because it is the perfect size for her to carry around.
R2XR00UBJHHIMA,"she has about 9 or 10 dolls and this is her ""go to"" doll every afternoon when i am with her."
R1NQCTOIUA3IYS,quick and easy game to play up to 8 players!
R10CI20QKOK0HW,love it!
R1P0CHKNWWZYHV,i gave this to my child and the recent reviews are spot on that mention heads pop off and the figures will not sit in the chairs.
R1P0CHKNWWZYHV,the plastic of the dolls dresses is a very smooth texture and so there is no friction to keep them in the seats.
R1P0CHKNWWZYHV,i personally tried over and over and i would equate the challenge of keeping the dolls seated to that of erecting a house of cards.
R1P0CHKNWWZYHV,it is not something most adults could accomplish.
R1P0CHKNWWZYHV,my daughter is so in love with all thing sofia and the items in this set appear to conform to the scale of the other toys for sale so it has some value as part of an overall collection.
R1P0CHKNWWZYHV,"virtually all sofia toys come with a new sofia doll, so my daughter already has many."
R1P0CHKNWWZYHV,i simply would not buy this toy if the recipient child does not already have a collection of sofia toys.
R1P0CHKNWWZYHV,"on its own, this toy is only going to be a frustrating waste of money."
RGGXQ9XRPR93S,this works well.
RGGXQ9XRPR93S,much better that the cheap stuff.
RGGXQ9XRPR93S,worth the extra money.
RGGXQ9XRPR93S,excellent for the wicked witch.
RGGXQ9XRPR93S,this has been used in two professional productions of wizard of oz.
RGGXQ9XRPR93S,one container will go through about 18 to 25 shows.
RYBQ6IRF6MZ2B,we received this as part of a bzzagent promotion.
RYBQ6IRF6MZ2B,it was a fun toy  definitely different from anything else my daughter has.
RYBQ6IRF6MZ2B,"at 8, shes maybe a little old for fairies at least according to her!, but she was still fascinated by the flying aspect and she and her 4 year old brother enjoy playing with it together."
RYBQ6IRF6MZ2B,i like toys we can use inside on rainy days that get them up and moving around a bit!
RYBQ6IRF6MZ2B,"we havent had it long, so cant speak to longevity of it, but so far its great!"
RYBQ6IRF6MZ2B,"i may purchase one as a gift for my friends daughter, whos turning 6."
REGBI84CJO9Y,"i love this, it is so much fun."

R3AHTFKSKWA3CB,fun
R7PJZ5JP91H0F,my daughter loves hello kitty and these fashems were great for her collection.
R7PJZ5JP91H0F,one figure per capsule and the mystery of not knowing what was made it fun.
R7PJZ5JP91H0F,the figure itself is smooshie and fun to play with.
R7PJZ5JP91H0F,"a little pricey for just one item in each capsule, but these are hard to find, so they were worth it."
R7PJZ5JP91H0F,shipping was super fast.
R29YKZKG7WONWY,love it
R1MH838AFYI9RI,really a fun game for families  emotions come out in a fun way!
R3V4YOK8YFEO6F,i am very pleased with this.

R3V4YOK8YFEO6F,i just wish it came with a sheath.
RJ3MOWBVRM0Y3,my grandkids love this!!
RJ3MOWBVRM0Y3,!
R2ZEQ5WVQWNWLO,i very much like this game.
R2ZEQ5WVQWNWLO,i have a short attention span and have no patience for a game that takes too long to learn.
R2ZEQ5WVQWNWLO,"i like simple games with simple rules that have deep strategies that become apparent the more you play and this game does not disappoint.one of the things that i like is that things change all the time, and sometimes dramatically, the person who has been ahead for the entire game now is the loser and the person the furthest behind is suddenly the leader."
R2ZEQ5WVQWNWLO,good strategy game with cards that provide enough randomness that you will be kept guessing.one of my favorites.
R3756EH7A4N7TX,gave as gift to 5yo girl.
R3756EH7A4N7TX,heard she loved it and is looking for any reason she can find to have picnics.
R1K6ULVZWIQDIQ,great for using at the pool this summer!
R1K6ULVZWIQDIQ,my only complaint is that it sits a little low in the water.
R1K6ULVZWIQDIQ,my baby is short so she was sitting pretty low.
R1K6ULVZWIQDIQ,this will be great as she gets bigger.
R34OMP9OZ12N3D,lots of fun but laud.
R34OMP9OZ12N3D,no volume adjustment.
R2PTJJF2QN7VKR,really cute
R1F76XHZRRGMNA,fun game...although i dont know if i would really consider it a game.
R1F76XHZRRGMNA,"i mean, i know it is but it is really just a way to get people talking."
R1F76XHZRRGMNA,we enjoyed playing this with our family.
R1F76XHZRRGMNA,"some of the questions were a little too deep for the kids, but still though provoking."
R1F76XHZRRGMNA,this would be a great thing to do with a small group as an ice breaker or even with a group of close friends as youre hanging out.
R1F76XHZRRGMNA,definitely a great way to get to know people better.
R1F76XHZRRGMNA,there are 4 different ways you can play the game so it will never get out...especially when you play with different people.
R1F76XHZRRGMNA,a lot of fun.
R1F76XHZRRGMNA,"sample provided for testing, evaluation and review."

RW99WICRIH90,"great value, great product, laughs all around."
RW99WICRIH90,"great for all ages too.also, if youre thinking of buying it just for yourself no worries there, this is great if you just want to see how long you can last before the tower drops."

R2DQCJSYC3B8L0,not the hightest quality they ripped the first night.
R2DQCJSYC3B8L0,"however, i didnt expect anything spectacular, due to the very low price."
R2DQCJSYC3B8L0,"with that being said, if you are looking for something for a costume party, and its a onetime thing, i would recommend these."
R2DQCJSYC3B8L0,"they were not thick, therefore they were not uncomfortable to walk around on all night."
R2DQCJSYC3B8L0,they were cute and went well with my outfit.
R2DQCJSYC3B8L0,"now, they seem really small when you open the package, like there is no way they could be plussize."
R2DQCJSYC3B8L0,"but, they do stretch."
R2DQCJSYC3B8L0,"overall, i am pleased with the purchase and will not hesitate to purchase again."

R3448Y34EBHOEN,if i could give this zero stars i would.
R3448Y34EBHOEN,partially my fault for not fully comprehending the description but also because this product was cheap.

R3448Y34EBHOEN,"plus, there were three multiples in the set."
R3448Y34EBHOEN,wish i could return it but my son already set his eyes on them and there is not taking them back.
R3448Y34EBHOEN,also not for children!
R3448Y34EBHOEN,"pieces are way to small, and the balls are way to hard.. just waiting for one to get thrown across the room and shatter a vase."

R16B4NLGSZO168,i got this toy for my son from another store and we both love it absolutely.
R16B4NLGSZO168,"the car is intended to change color as it goes through series of hot and cold water  and yes, it does."

R21GZEV3Q06MKV,love it
R2M1YP8I04SG87,had the old school purple and yellow one years ago as a kid and when i saw this on amazon i knew i had to buy one.
R2M1YP8I04SG87,i had hours of fun with the as a kid and have always been a fan of nerf products because they are usually well made and safe for children like my son to use.
R2M1YP8I04SG87,of course it arrived in a timely manner and when i opened it the smell of the nerf ball was exactly the same as when i was younger.
R2M1YP8I04SG87,awesome product to throw around on the beach and it floats which is full proof for kids.
R2M1YP8I04SG87,only two cons i can really see which arent completely bad anyway is that its alot smaller then i remember so when adults like me with huge hands throw it it strains your arm because its so light and small.
R2M1YP8I04SG87,secondly it doesnt whistle as loud as the one i had as a kid.
R2M1YP8I04SG87,but aside from that great product brought back alot of memories throwing it around with friends and my son.
R11BTLCEKRFEOG,bought this for my grand daughter and she loves it!
RPHUPRY3L0D98,"note  these balls are decent quality foam as described, but they are much smaller than regulation size baseballs."
RPHUPRY3L0D98,they are more like over sized golfballs.
R19HRXMZ9XC89T,it looks and works great.
R19HRXMZ9XC89T,five stars for functionality.
R19HRXMZ9XC89T,"the problem is that the one i got is a montana state quarter, so i had to hunt for a quarter that matches it in order to make a convincing switch."
R19HRXMZ9XC89T,would be a better product if it were simply a basic quarter.
R19HRXMZ9XC89T,"in fact, it never occurred to me until this arrived that the u.s. mint putting out all those state quarters makes using this gimmick a bit dicey, as you can no longer ask for a member of your audience to produce a quarter of their own for the switch the chance of their quarter not matching your gimmick quarter is too likely..."
R1RG69UT7W8LMP,fantastic game!
R1RG69UT7W8LMP,high quality components.

R2Q1EHYN2E4LY4,"that said, these guys were terrificreally vibrant colors, soft and cuddly, and really adorable."
R2Q1EHYN2E4LY4,these were a great size for a baby or toddler.
R2Q1EHYN2E4LY4,"recently my other kid has messed up some unwashable stuffed animals by throwing up on them, so i have recent motivation for buying machine washable toys."

R2A9OPD508W6UB,look just like daryl
R18JZZ2KN5X12E,"the mechanics are simple and familiar to veteran board game players, but numerous enough that getting up to speed for the first play takes a while."
R18JZZ2KN5X12E,"investing time to learn pays off, though, as the complexity of the strategy and the variability of each game provide an incredible experience every time."
R18JZZ2KN5X12E,this one is a real workout for your brain  strategy purists looking to weed out the luck factor of dice and random draws wont find a more rewarding game.
R18JZZ2KN5X12E,"from the very start, the impact of every decision you make is felt throughout the rest of the game."
R3CWA7DPNLD73O,"great product, just what i expected."
R3CWA7DPNLD73O,the camera was hd as announced by the seller.

R33K6MYPJRNQJW,"yes, it is fun but but it is very slow on the response time."
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,flying in the house it doesnt respond well to the controls.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,i cant get it to hover in one spot.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,"when i throttle up the power it takes off and hits the ceiling if you dont pull back on the throttle, but then it drops like a rock to the floor."
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,i broke one blade on my first flight.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,no idea where to get anymore other then the extras that came with the unit.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,range is not what they said.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,thirty meters is 98 feet but outside flying going straight up about as high as my single story house it shuts off and drops like a stone.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,flying vertically it wont make it to first base from home plate before dropping.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,"charging from my car charger, it takes 2030 minutes for about 5 minutes of flying time."
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,give or take.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,i get longer because it takes me time to go and turn it back over.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,if i could keep it in the air the whole time it would fly five minutes.
R33K6MYPJRNQJW,trim buttons dont seem to work.

R9I5FOLKU99RY,she tore into it and did all the designs.
R9I5FOLKU99RY,we both noticed that the spinner wasnt really needed.
R9I5FOLKU99RY,"i thought she had fun spinning it, but she claims not so much."
R9I5FOLKU99RY,she likes qixels and it keeps her busy and entertained.
R9I5FOLKU99RY,i think its a fun crafty toy for her age range.
R9I5FOLKU99RY,i think she would sooner have had more patterns and beads than the drier though.bottom line the kids love these kits.
R9I5FOLKU99RY,she will want more.
R9I5FOLKU99RY,they make a great gift for the age range.notes from sophie 11 you dont really need the drier and its kinda loud came with the same amount of designs and beads as a theme pack 4 you can do it without any parents help can be used up quick there is a lot of packing trash a lot like beados but squares
R3K0BF0LHNHR14,excellent product
R2092Q6XF1M394,loves it!
R2J7KGUIT0PATK,these are awesome.
R2J7KGUIT0PATK,just like lego brand but a lot cheaper.
R2J7KGUIT0PATK,"however, they just came in a clear plastic bag."
R2J7KGUIT0PATK,no labels.
R2J7KGUIT0PATK,no instructions.
R2J7KGUIT0PATK,possibly not ideal as a gift outside the house...
R2S8L725OT9TOY,the paint jobs are very nice and i will enjoy racing them.
R12ZJE74X8EJ7W,"it is an incredibly sensational product truly recommend it to all people and i is not designed for a specific role, it can be used from children to adults, lovers of the photographs, or single tourist."
R12ZJE74X8EJ7W,take great pictures of place complete.
R27404GDHQ8ZFB,great
R313VIH7O2FIRK,shoots way faster than i ever thought!
R313VIH7O2FIRK,had a nerf gun battle with over 40 people playing and this was the crowd favorite by far because of how fast and straight it shoots!
R2GEKISSPESCN8,perfect!
R2GEKISSPESCN8,my granddaughter loved it!

R1Q6JD30S177JB,3 year old son loved in his christmas stocking.
R1Q6JD30S177JB,"he takes it everywhere, small enough to fit in his jacket pocket."
R1Q6JD30S177JB,any paw patrol fan would like this toy.
R1Q6JD30S177JB,"no moving parts, but cute toy."
R1YJA8G4IDX766,had glue to keep from coming apart.
R32JCSPKF4KRNB,this was a present for my husbands birthday.
R32JCSPKF4KRNB,"he and my 11 year old daughter enjoyed putting it together fairly quickly.the audio from the speaker seemed poor, but its a science activity, not really a radio one would want to use that much."
R22D8SIWW5Y84N,very good detail and articulation.
R22D8SIWW5Y84N,not a bad price overall good deal and quality product.
R2F4A36X10V38X,i have used this rda everyday since i received it.
R2F4A36X10V38X,"i love it, great quality product"
RA7ANY83TE255,"my children have various star wars legos, and they like this one because the characters can sit in both the round window area and the other cockpit."
RA7ANY83TE255,fun to play with.
R3GM4DVPLQR0FZ,kids loved this at my daughters magical 5th birthday.
R3GM4DVPLQR0FZ,"came out of all the clothes, carpet, and even wall paint..."
R2D2JNNMYXVNNB,nicely made!
R3CRBV2LHOQIKI,"if you have a phd in mechanical engineering and a lot of free time on your hands, this is the toy for you!"
R3CRBV2LHOQIKI,getting the toy to work properly is extremely difficult.
R3CRBV2LHOQIKI,the amount of finesse required is ridiculous.
R3CRBV2LHOQIKI,im not kidding when i say i cannot imagine how this toy could have been made more complicated.
R3CRBV2LHOQIKI,"the instructions are the most elaborate of any toy i have ever seen, and they contain errors."
R3CRBV2LHOQIKI,plenty of other marble toys have greater function than this one and are much easier to assemble.
R3CRBV2LHOQIKI,"this toy is not robust, i.e."
R3CRBV2LHOQIKI,every piece must be assembled exactly.
R26R5CGE41OEB0,this is so cute and my 8 year old daughter loved it.
R26R5CGE41OEB0,but it arrived with a missing screw and one of the supports was split.
R26R5CGE41OEB0,we had to glue it before we could put in the screws.
R26R5CGE41OEB0,i hope it holds up.
R26R5CGE41OEB0,i would have returned it but it was for a birthday gift from her grandfather so i didnt have time.
R26R5CGE41OEB0,for all of that trouble i cannot give it more than 2 stars.
R1Y3NNNHIUU6S8,cute!
R1HQYUMVAAZJB4,grandson loves it.
R2S7ZUO23M5898,nice piece
R3IFDIHXFTA62B,seriously laughing reading these reviews.
R3IFDIHXFTA62B,"this toy is, in fact, obnoxious!"
R3IFDIHXFTA62B,"with that being said, its a tough lil dude!"
R3IFDIHXFTA62B,i bought this last year for the kids for xmas.
R3IFDIHXFTA62B,"since then it has outlasted 3 rainstorms, buried in the snow, and used as a digging toy as well."
R3IFDIHXFTA62B,it barely shows any wear and i have yet to even change the batteries.
R3IFDIHXFTA62B,there is no weird speaker noise since its been wet so many time.
R3IFDIHXFTA62B,i keep putting it outside since its so obnoxious and its weathered extremely well.
R3IFDIHXFTA62B,im impressed for sure.
R2KPI8L85NMYKG,and exactly what i need for a trip to ny!

R1T24RZR05I34D,lightweight and easy to assemble.
R1T24RZR05I34D,im able to carry it divingsnorkeling in 2 pieces so its not awkward.
R1T24RZR05I34D,"i use primarily for lionfish hunting, and its easy enough to take with each trip without being cumbersome."
R1T24RZR05I34D,nice carrying case as well.
R1T24RZR05I34D,"need to make sure to clean after each use, some rust will form around the grommets near the head."
R1T24RZR05I34D,delightful tool overall.

R9BMPWDJV69SY,not satisfied at all.
R17PBBK6ZJ9KU,boys picked out their birthday gifts from amazon.i found them very sturdy and boys loved them.
R3ANN81Q02N3IU,i remember playing with the little people play sets when i was a youngster and boy have they changed.
R3ANN81Q02N3IU,this set stands about 2.5 feet high which is the perfect height for a toddler.
R3ANN81Q02N3IU,my nephew just loves coming over to play with this  loves to make the plane or is it a helicopter &34fly&34 down the pole while he dances and carries on conversations with the little plane passengers.
R3ANN81Q02N3IU,"there is also a fuel depot, tower, and food court with seats overlooking the airfield."
R3ANN81Q02N3IU,very clever  but you definitely need more little people in this set.he loves it so much that i am looking forward to getting the raceway set also.
R1F05YBAYBXHG1,"so far, the lights function and look great!"
R1F05YBAYBXHG1,planning on buying more light kits from these guys!

RB8Z0RR5OW2L2,kids love it
R1GGQND33CFT7D,find it to go things that go.
R1GGQND33CFT7D,these find it games to go are limited quantity.
R1GGQND33CFT7D,these to go editions are half the size of the normal ones.
R1GGQND33CFT7D,perfect to throw into a travel bag or keep in the car for road trips.
R1GGQND33CFT7D,"this a contained game, so no chances of losing pieces."
R1GGQND33CFT7D,"every time someone comes to our house, they notice the find it games we have."
R1GGQND33CFT7D,"it never fails, they end up playing them while hanging out."
R1GGQND33CFT7D,"they are fun for all ages!adults get more competitive than the kids... well, at least the ones we know.you can play a few different ways."
R1GGQND33CFT7D,you can play solo or compete with a friend.
R1GGQND33CFT7D,"you can time yourself to see how fast you can find the items, or see if you can find them in alphabet order."

R1GGQND33CFT7D,dont forget to look out for the mystery item!

R3NV0FYUWVUDBQ,its really easy to learn.
R3NV0FYUWVUDBQ,theres a bit of strategy if you want to get really good.
R3NV0FYUWVUDBQ,replayability is high.i would recommend this game to people who want simple games to pick up and quick play times.
RG24FKSP8AZKS,it was a gift he loved them!
RG24FKSP8AZKS,!
RIGGNWXEA04GF,the fit was great and the quality was better that i expected.
RIGGNWXEA04GF,good buy!
R3LMU50S6Q6004,wish i would have read through the reviews before my purchase.
R3LMU50S6Q6004,the crown makes the headphones top heavy so they are constantly slipping off my four years old head.
R3LMU50S6Q6004,"the sound is barely a whisper, despite having the audio controls to max, maybe as one reviewer mentioned i too got stuck with a flawed product."
R3LMU50S6Q6004,if there is other noise going on in the room you can forget about hearing anything through these headphones.
R3LMU50S6Q6004,i am returning these and buying from another brand i purchased on the same order that work much much better and actually stay on.
RGDT1FRUX5UB8,well constructed and sturdy.
RGDT1FRUX5UB8,really good for the price.
RDJMNL7H304PY,"my son really likes this puppet, its very soft."
RDJMNL7H304PY,"i will say though that my hand barely fits in it, and my husbands hand doesnt fit at all and he doesnt have large hands."
RDJMNL7H304PY,"but besides that, the little tyke really likes it"
R1YBAOSEWSK0FT,"for $3, it doesnt get better than this."
R1YBAOSEWSK0FT,my baby girl loves the colors and the nice jingly sound.
R1YBAOSEWSK0FT,"its refreshing to hear a real bell sound, rather than another electronic fisher price toy."
R1YBAOSEWSK0FT,"this was shipped from china, but arrived in 3 weeks with no problems."
R2YWK8D3RO75JD,used them for welcome bags for our guests.
R2YWK8D3RO75JD,worked very nicely.
R2YWK8D3RO75JD,a bit flimsy but very pretty!
R11QGRJ6W27L5J,"there is no box that reset this game, quality of this item is bad i didnt like it."
R3SS4AI5T948VQ,i was very happy with the product.
R2DGVYS2KOLB0G,"i am a jigsaw whiz, but this one slowed me down considerably."
R2DGVYS2KOLB0G,definitely not one you can breeze through in just a few large chunks.
R2DGVYS2KOLB0G,but not complicated to the point of being frustratingly slow.
R2DGVYS2KOLB0G,"if you are a jigsaw aficionado and appreciate having one or two that require a few sessions to complete, i highly recommend this one."
R2N3Y7UN024AOC,amazing....only wish there was an adult nala and that sarabi was included.
R1PBUOJ4PWXXZX,excellent product.
R3DEP9CNR4B5H9,i was pleased with the product.
R3LBJG47G8TF1Y,great for a 2 year old boy.
R3LBJG47G8TF1Y,dont throw away the cardboard box the kit comes in.
R3LBJG47G8TF1Y,"without the sticker on it that shows where the tools go in the case, its hard to put back together."
R1O13H487SRJ2S,i bought these crayons for my 2yrold and she didnt like them.
R1O13H487SRJ2S,i think she was used to holding the normal crayons and she didnt quite know what to make of these ones.
R1O13H487SRJ2S,"they are very well made though, as she dropped them on the ground several times and they only had small chips fall off."
R3VWF5R0UZ2RGD,good
R33SUBNL0WAYHV,thanks
R2P7VTWRPMFR33,"love the color and look, however, material not as heavy so feet arent as steady"
R1CW8XZAAW7EDL,amazing deal for all of these party supply items!
R1CW8XZAAW7EDL,my daughter wanted a paris party for her 7th birthday.
R1CW8XZAAW7EDL,this theme was so cute!
R1CW8XZAAW7EDL,"would he great for older girls, too."
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,"videoid164d1b12ad70bf7050a19c925291a025first off, let me say that this scooter is fun!!!"
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,as you can see in the video i go from never having seen one to riding it comfortably in ten minutes.
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,the hardest part about learning to ride it was that all the neighbor kids wanted a turn!
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,"i really was enjoying it until i was able to get it above a few miles an hour, then i felt the slight rub on the right wheel that became worse at increased speeds."
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,then after charging it a second time i began to have issues with the battery.
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,every time i rode for more than five minutes the red battery light started blinking and the warning alarm buzzed.
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,id recharge it then try to ride it but then it started buzzing after riding it for three minutes.
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,so i contacted the leray people through the warranty card in the box they immediately emailed me a return ups label and as soon as they received my scooter they sent me a new one.
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,seamless.the new one works fine it charged up in under an hour and i rode for an hour this afternoon.
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,its really addictive!
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,"if you want to have some fun, i highly recommend getting one these scooters.ps  writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful and if not, why."
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,"also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below."
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,i usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours.
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,this item was provided for review consideration.cheers!
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,clairey and almost always within 24 hours.
R1QS8AOD6HX3ED,this item was provided for review consideration.

R3MECE9TN2XWTU,"this magnetic toy has brought hours of play into our house and is so much fun to pull apart, reconfigure, and put back together."
R3MECE9TN2XWTU,i would absolutely recommend this for both adults and kids who like to fiddle and explore.
R3MECE9TN2XWTU,we have lost many of the pieces over years and years of play and will likely get another one.
R14GUORLK6HCY9,based on the description that i read and the price i saw this looked like the big size car & i just got it today and its the tiny size car and the price u now have posted for it was not what i saw
R1Z49RF4LSRTAX,stuffed rayquaza is cute but puny.
R1Z49RF4LSRTAX,hes pretty thin.
R1Z49RF4LSRTAX,"parts of him were bent or flat, but i adjusted him as best i could."
R1Z49RF4LSRTAX,he came well before the time he was expected so no complaints with the time of shipment.
R1Z49RF4LSRTAX,"he was only packaged in a thin, gray ""envelope"" so that didnt help his condition, but the main problem was the manufacturing of rayquaza."
R1Z49RF4LSRTAX,i had hoped hed be thicker than he was.
R1KS6X0Z1EPCM7,different then the usual construction kit.
R1KS6X0Z1EPCM7,grand child had fun picking and choosing what to make.
R1KS6X0Z1EPCM7,gained much satisfaction when completed.
R2ZRQEX5P1H9AP,we have several other green toys vehicle toys.
R2ZRQEX5P1H9AP,weve always been very happy with how sturdy they are.
R2ZRQEX5P1H9AP,the oldest one we have has been in our home 4 years with plenty of use from young boys running around pressing down on it with their hands as they zoom it all over the place.
R2ZRQEX5P1H9AP,it looks as new as when we got it.
R2ZRQEX5P1H9AP,this dump truck is no exception and is making a lovely sandbox toy.
R2ZRQEX5P1H9AP,the little bear is relatively secure in his seat until you want to take him out.
R35FZTC6RKPWLW,do not order this!!!
R35FZTC6RKPWLW,i also failed to read the fine print and reviews thinking the price was for all 6 not just for one.
R35FZTC6RKPWLW,"even after ordering and reading the review, it was very hard to fine the statement that you will only get one."
R3979NGU3NXBG2,"horrible, too stiff are not self sealing so definitely not resealable."
R1POXMJ01J2T9X,a nice design and construction for a doll stroller.
R1POXMJ01J2T9X,my daughter loves it.
R1POXMJ01J2T9X,she loves it so much she sits in it sometimes.
R1POXMJ01J2T9X,this makes me a little nervous because the fabric seat is held by only small elastic straps which could easily break over time.
R1POXMJ01J2T9X,"i realize its made to support a doll, but kids will be kids."
R1POXMJ01J2T9X,besides that its a high quality item.
R2PZUVJ7LHGFO2,too little for the price you pay
R33QRX0XLHX18F,very cool!
RUD5VGKTL26TH,my husband love playing with this
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,so i bought this truck despite all the negative reviews... what the heck it looks great and i figured i could deal with whatever.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,"and this was true as the model, despite being advertised with no batteries included, it had the 2 of 3 sets of batteries with, and yes they were corroded, especially in the truck itself."
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,"nothing fatal, but i had to perform some work to restore all three items, truck, space shuttle and satellite to fine working order.the good news is that hess does a great job of screwing everything together, so things come apart pretty easily.heres what i had to do.1."
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,take out and dispose of batteries from the truck and satellite.2.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,clean acid build up from the terminals3.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,use wet or dry 400 grit sandpaper to scrub off the remaining corrosion on the terminals4.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,"take apart truck body, not cab careful, one of the taillight lenses came out along with the rear bumper."
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,and i accidentally dislodged one wire5.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,clean inside terminals.6.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,solder any loose wires on... use heat sink to prevent plastic melting.7.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,insert batteries and test lights with top of truck body off.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,they did not work for me!
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,"i then noticed that the positive and negative terminals of one side of the batterys contacts needed to be connected by a wire, but no wire was attached!"
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,"could of corroded off, but i didnt see it in the truck body.... go figure... so i took a wire and connected these two terminals together and wallah!"
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,the lights all worked on the truck.8.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,screw all back together9.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,clean all battery compartments for residual acidic leakage.10.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,"install batteries in all 3 items, testing as you go.it took a couple of hours in total, including getting tools, firing off the soldering iron, getting new batteries and cleaning up.today i skyped with my 4 yo a grandson and showed him the truck etc  he has a 2014 hess truck set i got him at his home in az.. he was pumped."
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,"he scrambled out to get his truckand we compared the toys, firing off lights, sounds etc."
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,he really got pumped when the satellite came out.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,so this is now his truck for when he visits.all in things worked out.
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,"shouldnt have to do out that, but didnt actually mind that much."
R1NOBV2ZHAK2SH,seller should fix the ad and take out all the three types of batteries... and lower the cost due to corrosion damage.
RRG5YOIMB66QT,i have not had a problem charging all of my batteries.
RRG5YOIMB66QT,i went from charging one at a time to charging all four within an hour.
RRG5YOIMB66QT,a product!
R39BPNWXE9O4N4,great quality!
RG6WZ99STIDOA,i bought this for my dad who has advanced dementia.
RG6WZ99STIDOA,"he was always mr. fixit so he was taking apart his walker.. liked unscrewing the height adjustment knobs, so i got this as a manipulative to relieve his need to do that."
RG6WZ99STIDOA,he will sit and take these out and put them in again for 20 or 30 minutes.
RG6WZ99STIDOA,he really enjoys it.
RG6WZ99STIDOA,only bad thing is keeping track of pieces.
RG6WZ99STIDOA,so many items for occupational therapy are crafty.. not always suited to men.
R2IOQZUQT30YJJ,it was sent in the time expected and it is exactly the same as the picture great satchel for my son
RVLBKNDWB9WRJ,"these are so much fun, my girls and their friends have been playing with them all weekend!"
RVLBKNDWB9WRJ,i received these free to review.
RVLBKNDWB9WRJ,"there are 100 glowsticks, and 100 connectors, so they made shapes, flowers, and jewelry of course."
RVLBKNDWB9WRJ,"all of ours glowed very bright, with no problems, except for one busting when they shaped a ball and tried to play too rough with it dont do that."
RVLBKNDWB9WRJ,"there is a good distribution of the colors, blue was my favorite but orange and redpink were the most popular."
RVLBKNDWB9WRJ,"these are a lot of fun, and the glowsticks were good into the next night."
RVLBKNDWB9WRJ,"i took pictures of them when they first activated and played with them, then into the next night."
RVLBKNDWB9WRJ,"by that time, they had faded a little, but were still glowing."
RVLBKNDWB9WRJ,a lot of fun!
R2UD1SSBTT2IVY,quality product
R3QT94BRZDHTNK,lots of fun
R2XZ9L15SCPJ9P,these are so hard to find now that squinkies arent as popular as they once were.

R55U7D3J4FHVJ,"becomes one of the most popular games this year because it comes in a square box, has a tempting graphic, is geared to older kids and most adults, consists of several components, and it is great fun."
R55U7D3J4FHVJ,my family members are bread bakers and artists and we like to be challenged.
R55U7D3J4FHVJ,"after a tasty dinner and some beverages, we clear the table and jump in to this game that can surprise us as the scoring progresses."
R55U7D3J4FHVJ,"being that the dohdler or the dohdlees can all score, anything can happen."
R55U7D3J4FHVJ,"playing the game with a group that did not know each other well got off to a slower start, but once the testing of boundaries moved into the fine line between too obvious a sculpture and the obscure creation, we were entertained over the period of more than an hour."
R55U7D3J4FHVJ,"since the dough is reused, i insisted that all hands be washed prior to playing and nobody minded once they realized my motivation."
R55U7D3J4FHVJ,"i expect that i will eventually be purchasing a replacement dough, though."
R3PNVBE1EP5ICP,love them!
R1Y0N5SQPJ9UT0,perfect for younger children.
R1Y0N5SQPJ9UT0,its been a couple months since i got it and still hasnt lost any air.
R3UIMJOB3MJ0LR,this doesnt function as any of the things it advertises.
R3UIMJOB3MJ0LR,there is no way to get leverage as a bottle opener and the ears stab your hand.
R3UIMJOB3MJ0LR,the keyring comes off with little effort.
R3UIMJOB3MJ0LR,"the tiny screwdrivers arent large enough for most screw tops, not to mention if the screws are recessed more than 1 cm deep."
R3UIMJOB3MJ0LR,im a huge batman fan and i love batmerchandise but $10.00 plus 5 for sh is not worth this.
R3HBRAZQKOWW7U,"package says 6, mine was open and only had 4"

RGYWFP1U7NSK3,bigger than we thought it would be for such a low price.
RGYWFP1U7NSK3,"my son loved it, thank you"
R1MS9UJE126MJT,these are fake.
R1MS9UJE126MJT,"they are flimsy, broken or broke on 2nd day."
R1MS9UJE126MJT,some wont even close.
R1MS9UJE126MJT,my eldest son has a whole collection of real bakugans and these are nothing close to the quality of the real ones.
R1MS9UJE126MJT,will be returning
RQSUQRLOEE8GI,neice loved it

R2DP78XY13QQU2,find it to go pet finder.
R2DP78XY13QQU2,these find it games to go are limited quantity.
R2DP78XY13QQU2,these to go editions are half the size of the normal ones.
R2DP78XY13QQU2,perfect to throw into a travel bag or keep in the car for road trips.
R2DP78XY13QQU2,"this a contained game, so no chances of losing pieces."
R2DP78XY13QQU2,"every time someone comes to our house, they notice the find it games we have."
R2DP78XY13QQU2,"it never fails, they end up playing them while hanging out."
R2DP78XY13QQU2,they are fun for all ages!
R2DP78XY13QQU2,"adults get more competitive than the kids... well, at least the ones we know.you can play a few different ways."
R2DP78XY13QQU2,you can play solo or compete with a friend.
R2DP78XY13QQU2,"you can time yourself to see how fast you can find the items, or see if you can find them in alphabet order."
R2DP78XY13QQU2,you can also make stories with the items you find.
R2DP78XY13QQU2,dont forget to look out for the mystery item!

RRAJ6KVE7LB15,perfect for my 5 year old.
RRAJ6KVE7LB15,"good quality, not easily breakable"
R1W9JS3KQZM3L3,not good for playing with dogs.
R1W9JS3KQZM3L3,brittle plastic that breaks and splinters way too easily..very disappointed.
R1D3B898RAJRSR,i love this item.
R1D3B898RAJRSR,it came in a precut flat pack of punchout woodcomposite pieces.
R1D3B898RAJRSR,all of the pieces are prepainted as described  pictured.
R1D3B898RAJRSR,it took maybe 3060 minutes of very easy assembly.
R1D3B898RAJRSR,the designassembly seems very well thought out.
R1D3B898RAJRSR,"the walls are doublelayered to provide some extra integrity.i love that the windows are cutout to allow you to see inthrough, unlike battlefront resin houses... it may not make a difference in play, because you still cant identify units through the tiny windows, but it is a nice touch.the roof can be removed in three separate pieces."
R1D3B898RAJRSR,the second floor can be removed as one piece.
R1D3B898RAJRSR,"there are tiny pegs  holes to align  steady the second floor on the first floor i can see those pegs getting destroyed with frequent use, but havent experienced that yet."
RB5L0VLGGY9ZI,perfect size for my toddler!
RB5L0VLGGY9ZI,he loves it!good quality too!
R2IQSBVRY6U3XZ,thanks.
R3BZFKUHLLLP58,something so simple and so clever.
R3BZFKUHLLLP58,"most children like to buckle and unbuckle, but they need practice."
R3BZFKUHLLLP58,this clever toy gives her the chance to practice for hours.
R3BZFKUHLLLP58,"its fun, its safe and its engaging  all the qualities of a great ""toy""."
R3BZFKUHLLLP58,a great alternative to beeps and buzzers.
R3BZFKUHLLLP58,nice for times when children need something entertaining and adults need children to be quiet.
R3BZFKUHLLLP58,perfect to take along to church.
R31ZT9TIAS8Q5,sound did not work on tractor.

RF62UI0V984JU,very cheap.
RF62UI0V984JU,"the binoculars broke the first day, everything else ended up being sent to goodwill."
RF62UI0V984JU,i wouldnt recommend it.
RMJMJ3ZFYU6KQ,"i am very beautiful for my minions, that beautiful and very suabe, so if you should have a zipper cambuiar batteries and wash in cao be required"

R31AADRBBN2W45,great
R2JJ6C79F0RG9E,this is one of the best tricks out there and anyone should be able to use it with very little practice.
R2JJ6C79F0RG9E,the effect is jawdropping.
R2JJ6C79F0RG9E,ive performed it for adults and children as young as 5 and they all loved it.
RE836T96W6UVQ,great metal model on a scale of 1 to 5 for difficulty with 5 being hard i would give it a 4. of all the metal models ships are the harder as you have to bend the metal without breaking it or popping the other side open.
RE836T96W6UVQ,the sails are also part of the difficulty.
RE836T96W6UVQ,but altogether a great piece fun to built and show off.
RV76YX9UBV1XM,very nice...but sounds are sometimes slow to putting the piece in but nothing bad enough for this still not to be a great tou
R3EHXCQ0L58E30,this was an inexpensive gift for my eleven year old granddaughter and she fell in love with it.
R3EHXCQ0L58E30,"it is soft, cute and unusual."
R3EHXCQ0L58E30,the primary color black made a nice stand out on her all pink bedspread and was a nice addition to her bed pillow assortment.
R3EHXCQ0L58E30,i think your little girl or pre teen would like this cute stuffed toy also.
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,i have an average sized 4 year old.
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,when he saw this set he was pretty excited.
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,"however, the excitement did not last long."
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,here are the issuessword the sword is hard foam.
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,which is good for not causing damage.
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,"however, the sword broke in half at the base of the bladetop of the handle after a couple of days of use."
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,"we tried gluing it, but it didnt hold.cape it is a bit too tight at the neck."
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,there is maybe an inch or two of play.
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,which is not that much for a kid running around.
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,"he excitedly put it on the first time, thought it was too tight and hasnt worn it since.sum if you are giving this to a boy with a thin neck that is very gentle with toys  then this is a great set."
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,"however, for the rest of the boys out there, it would be better if the neck was an inch or two bigger and maybe if there was a more solid layer under the foam to keep the sword from breaking easily."
R2A8SLK5FF7JOO,i hope this is helpful to you!
R1S5FRE5A2X7SI,this is so precious.
R1S5FRE5A2X7SI,"my granddaughter has a ""baby alive "" that she puts in it."
R1S5FRE5A2X7SI,she takes it into restraunts because it looks so much like the real thing her mom is afraid someone will break out the car window to save the baby.
R1ZHMPCG78G8TV,the product doesnt look the same as the pictures.
R1ZHMPCG78G8TV,the whole piece in orange.
R1ZHMPCG78G8TV,there is no instruction on how to put on the stickers too.
R2BHIY6PKLHG5V,disappointed with this puzzle.
R2BHIY6PKLHG5V,the pieces are very oddly shaped.
R2BHIY6PKLHG5V,would only recommend white mountain or buffalo puzzles
RSDUAO2NXDNZE,this goes great with my many leather bound books in my apartment that smells of rich mahogany.
R2WBQCPSK2HM5B,my son loves this puzzle
R11SOAVN0W5GBR,an excellent command center for a firefighter from the heart.
R1VOE7APRYZDHL,batteries were exactly as ordered.
R1VOE7APRYZDHL,much cheaper than in a big box store.
R1VOE7APRYZDHL,the plugs did not fit my late 80s power wheels however i found out they had been recalled.
R1VOE7APRYZDHL,a quick call to mattell and i was directed to a service center for rewiring.
R1VOE7APRYZDHL,now my 3 year old drives my old toys 20 plus years later.on a full charge the batteries last 3040 minutes of continuous use.
R2UYRAOQ48XABL,"absolute garbage, such poor quality and a waste of money."
R2WPIPHCAIMUIC,my grandson loves these cards.
R2WPIPHCAIMUIC,thank you
RRZ87KYT54KZM,"i bought this for our 18 month old grandson who goes crazy for balls, any size, any shape!"
RRZ87KYT54KZM,he loves sitting on the floor and throwing the wiggly giggly ball and then racing after it to throw it again.
RRZ87KYT54KZM,"he likes the sounds that it makes, unlike our dogs!"
R1RDPUBNZ3PIEV,i was a gift.
R1RDPUBNZ3PIEV,the little girl it was given to rarely puts it down.
R3QSRUXS2XBZ4G,the mat cleans easily and is of a decent weight.
R3QSRUXS2XBZ4G,works as needed.
RN7WJY4MMEZLI,my grandson had so much fun and interest in this item!
RN7WJY4MMEZLI,good service!
R3OFWPI3VM2Z0K,nice metal puzzle!
R3OFWPI3VM2Z0K,"great challenge, since my son solves a rubiks cube in minutes."
R2KGW68IPZUXPK,this game is the perfect blend of rpg story telling and card gameboard game mechanics.
R2KGW68IPZUXPK,the game is easy to learnteach which allows anyone with an interest in fantasy games to play.
R2KGW68IPZUXPK,ive played it solo and with others and its a blast either way.
R2KGW68IPZUXPK,"there is a lot of content in the base set, which gives it a lot of replay ability."
R2KGW68IPZUXPK,"the best part is the thematic experience that the game gives.there is enough flavor text to give characters and locations a story and your imagination will fill in the details, creating an exciting adventure."
R2KGW68IPZUXPK,one of the best cardboard games ive played.
R1514JYDOXY1PO,"this is super, my husband has wanted this game forever..........."
R1YLHWG6EF6LLO,i love my mad moxxi.
R1YLHWG6EF6LLO,but the only problem is that her head seems to be leaning forward to much and she keeps falling over.
R1YLHWG6EF6LLO,but other than that she is beautiful and better than i had expected.
R1H3R966RVDUXT,i will buy again.
R1H3R966RVDUXT,very well made.
R27WW0W6ACY5BD,im rehabbing a right femur fracture and this is what i needed.
R27WW0W6ACY5BD,put i between my knees and squeeze.
RHU4JA1WTEGHC,had a great time playing with friends.
RHU4JA1WTEGHC,be prepared for some vulgarity.
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,"id agreed that a couple of little eight year old special someones could stay up until they got this constructed, so i thought that i was being played when two hours came and went and it was still in pieces."
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,"it was my night to be ""off,"" so it fell to my spouse to bring it to an end."
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,using his own kid friendly profanity snuggerfuts!
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,"and infinite patience, he was able to help them get the various scattered bits assembled into a final product."
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,the problem was one of strength some pieces required real muscle power in order to achieve a full connection.
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,play finally began after a few test runs identified which tracks needed additional adjustments.
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,they barely played an hour before being done with it for the night.
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,the next morning they had another hour before their mother picked them up and they spent every possible minute with it until they left.
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,it waits for them on the dining room table and i notice it wobbles a lot when i pass by.
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,i spoke to t2 twin two this morning and asked if he loved it or liked it like and if there was anything people buying this should know he said to say that it needs more marbles.
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,"in short, this asinb00txnj45m the learning journey techno gears marble mania zoomerang building kit 100piece, multi may require adult assistance to put together and, if you buy it, you should consider buying extra marbles too."
R31RNTRT1V6KF6,any toy that can inspire hours of play is a plus in my book.
R9Z3P4RXWCSZF,looks just like our shorthair cat with black whiskers but there are no whiskers on it like ours does all of the other black cats i have seen do not have whiskers eitheroh well adorable and very soft though plus the size is just perrfect
R2TR1QJJ5I9MZG,"my nephew really loves this car, it was a pain in the you know what to assemble."
R1Y0XEH85JASDZ,can i say amazing 100 times?!?!?!
R1Y0XEH85JASDZ,why didnt i think of this??
R1Y0XEH85JASDZ,this is the best when you need to tie a ton of balloon knots!
R1Y0XEH85JASDZ,"you just have to get the hang of it, but you can get the hang of it in less than 1 minute, trust me buy this product, your fingers will thank you!"
R2SOGY6QZFNC9B,we received this through buzzagent.
R2SOGY6QZFNC9B,my 7 and 3 year old girls loved it.
R2SOGY6QZFNC9B,even my 8 year old son thought it was fun.
R2SOGY6QZFNC9B,"this would be a really cool toy for a group playdate or sleepover!direction were easy to follow with pictures so the girls were able to figure it out on their own!kids could load the bracelets, stamp them and change to the other stamp wheel with no problems!kids wanted to give it 5 stars."
R2SOGY6QZFNC9B,"because i have since found the clips that hold them together meaning they are no longer in bracelet form that part i am disappointed in, when they find their bracelets again, the clips are now gone."
R2SOGY6QZFNC9B,"however, for a playdate or sleepover it would be really cool!"
RP50EDIFOYWDL,we had been looking for additional princesses to add to our disney plush collection and this was the perfect addition.

R2MU1OZ076A80V,daughter takes it everywhere and it holds up to hard use.
REIDWLCGAV32C,this shopkin compatible organizer is exactly what i needed!
REIDWLCGAV32C,"i do not own or collect shopkins, but i have been looking for an organizer that is small and compact that i can use for my jewelry when traveling."
REIDWLCGAV32C,my regular jewelry organizer that comes on a hanger is way to big to take with me.
REIDWLCGAV32C,this organizer is exactly what i was looking for.
REIDWLCGAV32C,"the pockets fit eatings, rings, and necklaces."
REIDWLCGAV32C,i love that i can zip up a row and have my jewelry stay securely in place.
REIDWLCGAV32C,"when i would previously travel, i would just lump all my jewelry in a one pocket case and then when i needed to wear it, i would have all my necklaces tangled up in one giant mess and it was an absolute nightmare!"
REIDWLCGAV32C,another great feature about this case is that it has a hook you can use to hang it up.
REIDWLCGAV32C,"additionally, you can also fold the case and close it using the velcro."
REIDWLCGAV32C,i have attached some pictures to show how well it works with my jewelry.
REIDWLCGAV32C,it will also store compactly in my luggage in a closed position.
R1RRWWPX4HUZLU,this was a huge hit.
R1RRWWPX4HUZLU,i bought two of them  for two of my granddaughters and they loved them
R35VXMHM0N2L0R,"kids really enjoyed it, i loaded it up with candy and it held up."
RNRH43V6RUNR8,good product
RV385E3BMFYSW,came defective
R9G8OO6O0Q97A,i wanted blue ink and the vendor could not tell me the color of ink.
R9G8OO6O0Q97A,"turned out to be black, i just gave them away."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,this toy is a knockitoutofthepark hit.
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"sure, the toy is, as one reviewer noted, &34limited play.&34 the &34limited&34 part is that it does five things, and requires a ton of room, like a family room or a really big outdoor area."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,blaze does not work well on carpeting.
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"though blaze &34only&34 does five things, periodically you get cued to give blaze a hand, like filling his tires or revving his engine.blaze is surprisingly heavy, but the weight is needed to help blaze do his multiple stunts."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,a lever automatically lowers to help blaze do his various stunts.
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"technically, blaze only does five things, four of which are stunts, but blaze seems to do a bit of adlibbing from time to time that makes the five stunts seem like a lot more."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"blaze lifts up from the back, from the front, from the side, and does tail spins."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,blaze also talks and provides his own music.
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"admittedly, the talking and music can get a little old, but it is so amusing to watch blaze do tricks that we had little time to be bored.the only &34down side&34 to blaze is that blaze requires a lot of area without carpeting to do his stunts."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"blaze does have a power mode that works okay on carpet, but any stunts that use the automatic lever work much better on a relatively smooth surface, like a concrete or hardwood floor.we have had many different toy vehicles over the decades, some of which were nearly the cost of this vehicle."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,many of those vehicles only did one thing.
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"occasionally they might do something else, like pop a wheelie."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,but none of those vehicles would do all the things this vehicle will do.
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"frankly, i would have loved this toy as a child."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"what the heck, i love this toy as an adult."
R3ED60RC69CCQ6,"then there are the grandchildren, if they can get it away from grandpa.enjoy!"
R3PHJJJIVHHE3A,my 4 yr od granddaughters love playing ariel.
R3PHJJJIVHHE3A,"looks great and quality matierial, as cosstume materials go.just know the &34boa&34 and wig are not included."
R142EO5UT7FMAE,nice utility belt to add to your childs batman costume.
R237LE5Q6P0HMC,great buy for any alabama fan!
R7GYOGFN7MPJN,"this has a very long distance range, which is perfect for the use i put it to!"
R214VYBXIY8SFA,the item came with robin suffering from a loss of limb.
R214VYBXIY8SFA,these are the most fragile toys ive ever bought.
R214VYBXIY8SFA,def not meant to actually be played with.
R214VYBXIY8SFA,batmans jacket required a hot glue gun right out of the box.
R214VYBXIY8SFA,ultimately the dog ate them.
R214VYBXIY8SFA,theyre dollar store trash.
R23UO3HSWEFGNP,im very pleased
R2FBM6N22SP31V,ridiculously cool.
R2FBM6N22SP31V,needed more padding in the shipping box.
R2FBM6N22SP31V,the edge is a bit bent up.
R2FBM6N22SP31V,but he is impressive and an awesome addition to my collection.
R2T8YLS43EFIVG,balloons do not fill up.
R2T8YLS43EFIVG,shoot off empty.
R2T8YLS43EFIVG,dont pop.
R2T8YLS43EFIVG,the product breaks when trying to use it.
R2T8YLS43EFIVG,dont send the return intructions.
R2T8YLS43EFIVG,bad product
RUGW356L19MPD,i love it!
RUGW356L19MPD,it was delivered way faster than expected and my one year old loves figuring out how the blocks work together.
RUGW356L19MPD,she loves matching the puzzle pieces its allowing her cognitive skills to function faster than it would had i plopped her in front of the television.
RUGW356L19MPD,we use the books and make songs out of them.
RUGW356L19MPD,overall great product worth every penny.

R6W8VG9QZ4P00,the intrusions are simple and they arrive fast!
R2KQBA2ZQTYFS7,ok
R354F7Q0T6B8UW,very feminine and well made.
R2YRH48DVVNE9E,this gun works well.
R2YRH48DVVNE9E,4 stars instead of 5 because target sells the same thing for 4.99.
RBGFXO7CJA348,i love clown fish and these are adorable.
RBGFXO7CJA348,in general i really enjoyed building this.
RBGFXO7CJA348,the big fish fell apart a couple of times when i was building it i had to be careful where i applied pressure.
RBGFXO7CJA348,it wasnt too hard to put back together though.
RBGFXO7CJA348,"the only issue is that i cant get it to connect to the blue ""water"" plate."
RBGFXO7CJA348,"i mean, it will stand there, but the blocks are facing the other direction so its not secured."
RBGFXO7CJA348,i guess id have to use super glue.
RBGFXO7CJA348,"other than that, it was really fun."
RC2AHQZXXJRBI,"kids loved it, but a seam split after three weeks and now it leaks air significantly."
R2BCCD4DD4536L,"it is a nice set i thought they were smaller then an average deck but then remembered a good size for kids hands i havent used them yet, im still waiting for my grandkids to come visit."
R2BCCD4DD4536L,but from what i can see they will work out just fine.

R2ZVKU440LEN13,the color and detailed paint is true to the product photo.
R2ZVKU440LEN13,construction is rigid plastic with little bend in any parts.
R2ZVKU440LEN13,"measuring about 8 inches in diameter and standing about 4 inches tall, this will look great on the shelf or in an special staged setting."

RAJ1ESPK6N0Q6,"went and had my balloons filled for wedding decorations, and as soon as one touched a wall it popped, but the other balloons lasted kids playinf with them and touching them."
RAJ1ESPK6N0Q6,"they were as pictured, even fast delivery"
R2ATRPNQNJZN35,why oh why does my child insist on these things.
R2ATRPNQNJZN35,$13 for two tiny pieces of plastic.
R2ATRPNQNJZN35,but... it makes her sooooo happy.
R2ATRPNQNJZN35,and at least it is not an app.
REPRMRBOUY1NY,kids just love it!
REPRMRBOUY1NY,great for practicing prewritingwriting skills.
R2JUA090KAXWKI,"ordered 12, received 11. rings were exactly as pictured and very cute."
R3V3AFWPY369L,"while i shudder at the thought of playing with nasty creepy crawlers now, i can remember as a young boy being fascinated with whatever i managed to dig up, scoop up, catch in a jar, etc."
R3V3AFWPY369L,etc.
R3V3AFWPY369L,"from spiders to worms, toads to lightning bugs, things &34in the wild&34 were part of my little world."
R3V3AFWPY369L,"of course i didnt have anything cool like this set, but boy i wish i did, and i imagine any youngster of those magical years would be all over this.to foster a potential interest in biology & life sciences, this is a decent start."
R3V3AFWPY369L,consider purchasing the set which comes with the critter barn asinb00uus460c nature bound bug vacuum and critter barn habitat combo set.
R2S7MFA2MQ179V,got this for my 12 year old granddaughters birthday.
R2S7MFA2MQ179V,it has been the hit of the family.
R2S7MFA2MQ179V,she brings it everywhere & loves playing it.
R2S7MFA2MQ179V,it makes for good laughs not everyone knows the right words to a song theyve been singing along to forever....!!

R3JPZ9QU42ILU6,this product arrived in my hands at the perfect time.
R3JPZ9QU42ILU6,"my 3 year old daughter is intrigued by pretend kitchen play, and she did not have an oven."
R3JPZ9QU42ILU6,"as her older siblings head back to school, this will be the perfect way for her to start learning number concepts and play at the same time."

R1KR93995CV8X,my son love it
R2H1QYDLDDBSFH,these family finger puppets are so adorable and are a great price.
R2H1QYDLDDBSFH,my son loves peppa pig and he wanted to have finger puppets just like her.
R2H1QYDLDDBSFH,i really wanted to love these but after just a week of use they started falling apart.
R2H1QYDLDDBSFH,"grandmas bun fell off, the dads tie came off, and this was with light play!"
R2H1QYDLDDBSFH,i would not recommend these for families with small children as the pieces that fall off may be a choking hazards!
R2H1QYDLDDBSFH,bottom line is if you do decide to purchase these please either reinforce the glue that is on the hair and clothes or sew the small parts on to avoid a potential disaster with your little ones!
R1HNSS7ERMSFAI,was very disappointed with this game.
R1HNSS7ERMSFAI,i have the original and we have enjoyed it very much.
R1HNSS7ERMSFAI,the decades version is definitely meant for the younger generation.
R1HNSS7ERMSFAI,it has too many names of musicians in it to suit the group i play with older adults.
R1HNSS7ERMSFAI,sorry i wasted my money!
R1HNSS7ERMSFAI,i gave it to a friend to give to her teenage grandchildren.
R112TJIJW370N7,love it
R26DIZY5OTQZ5O,i have used this air mattress in my pool for over a year now.
R26DIZY5OTQZ5O,the hot florida sun has been beating down on if for all that time and it still has no air leaks.
R26DIZY5OTQZ5O,the built in pillow makes lying on your back very comfy and when i want to lie on my belly i put my head at the other end.
R26DIZY5OTQZ5O,when this one dies i will be coming back for another.
R29PB26T2W4J59,"beautiful dress, just what my little princess wanted."

R1HEH2SZR0F9AF,i love this little guy.
R1HEH2SZR0F9AF,"this is the second one ive had, first order online."
R1HEH2SZR0F9AF,the first one i bought in a store lasted a very long time.
R1HEH2SZR0F9AF,its a toy for my cat.
R1HEH2SZR0F9AF,she thinks its her friend and she just likes to lay with it while it runs around.
R1HEH2SZR0F9AF,"i put out a large low plastic tub so azer can run around without running off somewhere and my cat, the other wasnt interested, enjoys its chatter."
R2B0VDHI8TBLXH,perfect condition.
R1FJR69XQDQ9XH,i love this case!
R1FJR69XQDQ9XH,it is great quality and perfect for my hubsan x4 and accessories.
R2DBEI0Z7SALUT,my 5 yr old loved this product and it was perfect for his age.
R2DBEI0Z7SALUT,he had a blast since he loved the turtles!!
R2DBEI0Z7SALUT,!
R2ANI8DDAHXEGI,very cute!
R2ANI8DDAHXEGI,"it came inflated, but others say theirs did not, and that they needed an air pump."
R2ANI8DDAHXEGI,i am guessing it depends on where they are shipping to as to whether it is inflated or deflated upon arrival.
R2ANI8DDAHXEGI,because of air pressure when traveling by plane.
R2M9C1T9EEELD0,"our 1 yr old is not walking on his own yet, and just got this for his birthday from grandma."
R2M9C1T9EEELD0,"i like it a lot solid wood construction, sturdy, colorful, a great height he can grow into, and best of all, no noise!"
R2M9C1T9EEELD0,im so over plastic toys playing songs!!
R2M9C1T9EEELD0,"!i wish this had adjustable tension, but honestly, even on our tile floors it doesnt move too quickly."
R2M9C1T9EEELD0,"he hasnt really figured out how to sit from standing, so he has pulled it over backwards on himself once."
R2M9C1T9EEELD0,"the only reason i only like and not love the walker is the design in the front which allows my son to run the red &34fenders&34 into walls, doors, etc."
R2M9C1T9EEELD0,though i will say it hasnt left a mark...yet.
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,my family uses the lil monkey playground jungle gym monkey bar in our home daily.
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,we have setup the jungle gym in our living room so our son with asd can use it anytime he wants.
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,"for ot purposes, we place a crash pad under the unit and my son climbs to the top and drops down onto his crash pad from the topmiddle opening.note my children who use the gym are 1, 3, and 5.my five and three yearold children are able to use the gym at the same time without it disconnecting from the floor."
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,"on occasion, if my five yearold jerks the unit intentionally, he can make one side bounce but this is an intentional act on his part and the gym doesnt move more than a centimeter before returning to the floor."
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,they offer ground anchors that are sold separately if this is a concern for someone.my 1 year old walks around the outside of the gym and swings from the lowest bar  he loves it.all of my children enjoy their time climbing on the gym unit.in regards to the application that accompanies this product... this is why i havent provided a perfect score.
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,the application that is offered to be used with the lil monkey playground jungle gym doesnt promote the child actually using the gym.
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,"the child can use the app by sitting away from the gym, alone with their tablet, and pointing the tablets camera at the gym."
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,i dont understand how this promotes actual use of the gym and i believe the app hinders the overall &34get active&34 goal.
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,i wish i could rate these two items separately.
R2HS8UGP3BGPDK,"if i could, the gym itself would receive a perfect, 5 stars, and the app would receive only 1."
RVPVY1RPV313K,these do not look like jumbo building blocks to me.
RVPVY1RPV313K,i have a set of foam blocks with larger blocks and was hoping they would be the same size as my current set.
RVPVY1RPV313K,they are much smaller.
RVPVY1RPV313K,"they will probably do for our purposes, but wish that jumbo, meant jumbo."
RVPVY1RPV313K,the blocks are about the same size as standard wood building blocks.
R1YWT9YP0G2UXH,perfect all around.
R1YWT9YP0G2UXH,great service and fun game.
R349I1WSBJMVFO,this is a very cool little toy.
R349I1WSBJMVFO,my little guy is super involved in it and asks for it all the time.
R349I1WSBJMVFO,"he puts the shape into the box, will stack them on the top, count the shapes by number as he puts them in."
R349I1WSBJMVFO,great learning activity.
R349I1WSBJMVFO,i love the old school basic game versus screen time on a tabletcomputer.
R1ZGMBQ78UZ4M1,my daughter loves this.
R32C7LR27Z5G63,granddaughter enjoys it!
R32C7LR27Z5G63,great addition to her play fort.
R8Y0I52RB5IXC,easy to use  its on top of bunkbeds in our house.
R8Y0I52RB5IXC,i needed to make a quick alteration for side entry into the tent.
R8Y0I52RB5IXC,i cut the side in an inverted t and added self adhesive velcro tape and fashion tape to make a hem!
R8Y0I52RB5IXC,worked perfectly!
R31WLHSJQJJR9M,got it for our sons birthday and it doesnt work.
R31WLHSJQJJR9M,i assumed a battery would be in it but my sons either came with a dead battery or none at all havent opened the back yet.
R23HBO7DEE3XZ0,great!
R1TE5ER3BDMPXL,"my 3 yr old grandson liked the leaf blower, the grass trimmer, the chain saw, and goggles."
R1TE5ER3BDMPXL,the gloves were large enough for my daughter in law.the mower was disappointing in that all other components made noise and  or lit up not the mower.
R1TE5ER3BDMPXL,it did have spinning fan when the starter was pulled.
R1TE5ER3BDMPXL,it was of such little interest that he gave it to his year old brother sitting on the floor.
R39E8DVYHBMLXW,hilarious game!
R39E8DVYHBMLXW,great with a group.
R3I95ZS4P1DB79,"if you like game of thrones andor monopoly, i would recommend this product."
R3I95ZS4P1DB79,"for fans of the show, it makes many references with all aspects of the game."
RGJV21I6XLGNL,figure came promptly and in great condition.
RGJV21I6XLGNL,"the arms come unattached and there is a line that is noticeable where the right one connects to the shoulder, but that is more of a sculptural thing than a shipper thing and if you dont where to look, its actually not that noticeable."
R1JZD1Y3HR2HHE,love it
R341FNE4F26NVO,in the tool box
R3NRYY7K6KFRMJ,"pointless waste of space in our home  my kids were so desperate to get this, and once we did, they played with it for a day before getting bored."
R3NRYY7K6KFRMJ,"the beads dont stick together well at all, and then im left finding all the tiny beads that rolled under the furniture."
R3NRYY7K6KFRMJ,im throwing this away as soon as school starts!
R1KQ3ZHEUE5NHV,thanks.
R2I4B94JN10ZS,very good quality.
R2I4B94JN10ZS,beautiful attention to detail.
R2I4B94JN10ZS,great for ag dolls.
R2I4B94JN10ZS,have bought for gifts as well
R3BPNH2AT4K95T,i bought this at a warehouse store for 16.99. it is excellent quality for a costume.
R3BPNH2AT4K95T,my kids are super sensitive to the scratchy fabrics usually used in costumes.
R3BPNH2AT4K95T,this is a super soft fabric with no scratchy edges.
R3BPNH2AT4K95T,the skirt is scratchy tulle but it has a great satin underskirt that protects little legs.
R3BPNH2AT4K95T,"my set included a gold belt and a little purse as well as the pictured cape, cuffs, and headband."
R3QVYOYJ45R2ME,exactly as it was described and arrived quickly
R113Z5OMH3SAAE,got it for my husbands birthday.

R1N8JNM6GB6BH1,my granddaughter was very please with this and i received it in just a few days.
R38OP6U0YYB5IA,my wife the science teacher was happy to spend her own money on these!
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,as an rc pilot for over 20 years i have lots of fun with this.
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,several things to consider based on the non sense comments made from some really uninformed buyers.1.
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,this is based on a balloon.
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,do you really expect it to take abuse?
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,cmon man2.
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,this is based on a balloon filled with helium.
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,you take it outside and it either flies away or doesnt stay put.
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,really?this is a novelty item for indoor use only and not a high end rc aircraft.
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,my kid loves it and my office mates get a kick out of flying past their cubes.
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,if you want high end rc then you are in the wrong section.
R2A2SD7EY1WRII,"with this said i love mine and when i break it, ill buy the replacement balloon and keep it flying."
R3QTVBB4E49JYV,my almost six year old daughter just discovered flipsies and absolutely adores sandys house & ocean cruiser!this is a super interactive toy that keeps her entertained for hours.
R3QTVBB4E49JYV,"there are lots of things for sandy and her little pink dolphin friend to do  drive the boat, ride the zip line, eat a turkey dinner, go down the water slide, splash in the pool, take a bath and even go to bed.each area on the ocean cruiser has a sensor and when sandy touches it, she talks specifically about being in that area  with multiple phrases for each area."
R3QTVBB4E49JYV,you never knew what she was going to say!sandy comes with multiple outfits and hairdos so that she can transform her look depending on what kind of play your child is having with her.
R3QTVBB4E49JYV,the boat also flips up so children can play with sand both outside and inside the boat.sandys house & ocean cruiser was easy to put together  all i had to do was just snap pieces into place.
R3QTVBB4E49JYV,there is also a detailed diagram for all the decals.
R3QTVBB4E49JYV,it took about 7 minutes in total to prep for my daughter.what i really like about this set is how it stimulates my daughters imaginative play.
R3QTVBB4E49JYV,"its also great that sandy is a marine biologist, talking about dolphins and even a whale  she will definitely inspire girls to go into science and into careers that helps others."
R3QTVBB4E49JYV,"""the product has been provided by vtech so you could experience it with your family however, the thoughts and opinions are all your own."""
RY6YPV7PR3GO,id say overall that this is a decent little kit.
RY6YPV7PR3GO,i wanted some motorswheels and a battery holder for a cardboard fighting robot and this was cheap enough that ill be fine if these parts get destroyed.
RY6YPV7PR3GO,"i did assemble the kit with the acrylic base for testing, and many of the holes didnt like up quite right and needed to be drilled out slightly larger before i could mount things, and i couldnt find any existing holes that would work to mount the battery holder."
RY6YPV7PR3GO,"if the acrylic plate had been better, this would be a 5 star purchase, easily."
R27VGDFHLQP8I7,good
RV81TX559B40P,ran a bit small.

R21AESMNGFD8ZN,a seller.
RBM9H5VB6HBGW,i bought this set of rubiks cube for my little brother and he loves them!
RBM9H5VB6HBGW,its probably due to the fact that he loves solving rubiks cube but he said the set is pretty decent.
RBM9H5VB6HBGW,"they turn smoothly, no problem with that."
RBM9H5VB6HBGW,some of them were a bit loose but its not a problem since it is possible to tighten them.
RBM9H5VB6HBGW,each cube also comes with a manual that provides the basics about the patterns which can help you solve the puzzle.
RBM9H5VB6HBGW,"the thing is, some of the pvc stickers were noticeably off specially on the 5x5x5 one."
RBM9H5VB6HBGW,"overall, for less that $20 its a pretty great steal and is a must if youre a beginner in solving rubiks cube."

R1VSMVIBR7BKKZ,"did not make my little granddaughter very happy needless to say, also the keys that came with it were inside the locker, we had to pick the lock to get it out."
R1VSMVIBR7BKKZ,"we kept it anyway, but not very satisfied with this purchase."
R1VSMVIBR7BKKZ,"the locker is as expected, just as described."
R1RWH1BJ7JAT81,my niece and nephew absolutely loved this.
R1RWH1BJ7JAT81,"it comes with 12 pieces of paper, 3 little markers ad 10 stamps."
R1RWH1BJ7JAT81,"it doesnt come with batteries, so the stamps will only light up once you put in 3 aas."
R1RWH1BJ7JAT81,"the stamps have covers so they will last a little longer, which i thought was a nice touch."
R1RWH1BJ7JAT81,"this is a wonderful product if your little one is especially messy it cant get on the table or walls, so its pretty much magic."
R3TNPTM6XRY6MG,cheaply made.

R36200G9M4WBLT,this lasted about two hours before two of the wires shorted out on one of the booms and fried the controller.
R36200G9M4WBLT,now i have to remove everything and send it in to be tested before they will even think about replacing any parts.
R36200G9M4WBLT,"the hobbytown store i bought it at said too bad, call the manufacturer, not our problem."
R36200G9M4WBLT,dont buy!
R36200G9M4WBLT,"update firelands sent the replacement parts, took hours to install, still doesnt fly right, going in trash right now."
R36200G9M4WBLT,might as well throw $100 out the window.
R36200G9M4WBLT,"we bought a syma x8hg for $135 on amazon, and it is awesome."
R36200G9M4WBLT,"both my sons have them, my older son has the cheaper one without altitude hold and we love them."
R36200G9M4WBLT,"the x8 series starts at $58 believe it or not, and they are much, much better quadcopters."
R36200G9M4WBLT,the ares is junk compared to the syma!!

R2F9SNM9S6XG45,"he tried it on and it fit him great, then he tried it on me and it fit as well, its not an elastic material but more of a stretchy material."
R2F9SNM9S6XG45,"he even tried it on one of his angry birds ""bad piggies""."

R25VI6HLTZ3WCP,pumping air in this thing was a daunting task.....up to an extent where i ended up not using it.
R3A5GTUFEFFK41,its a great figure is also in scale with my universal monster retro cloth figures
R3I4XBG33PXO5K,i received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.
R3I4XBG33PXO5K,the instructions were simple and it was pretty easy to use.
R3I4XBG33PXO5K,some balloons didnt fill up with water at first but we were able to get most filled up on the second try.
R3I4XBG33PXO5K,the balloons pop easier when they hit the floor but we still had fun using them.
R3I4XBG33PXO5K,good
R21ECAILPS2S6R,we have several other green toys vehicle toys.
R21ECAILPS2S6R,weve always been very happy with how sturdy they are.
R21ECAILPS2S6R,the oldest one we have has been in our home 4 years with plenty of use from young boys running around pressing down on it with their hands as they zoom it all over the place.
R21ECAILPS2S6R,it looks as new as when we got it.
R21ECAILPS2S6R,this dump truck is no exception and is making a lovely sandbox toy.
R21ECAILPS2S6R,the little bear is relatively secure in his seat until you want to take him out.

R11HBOZV4Q4J9Y,given as a gift
R2MLZWOSNHXEL6,"the way it works, the appeal to the toddlers and preschoolers in the house... all this is great."
R2MLZWOSNHXEL6,what i took off stars for is that its obnoxious.
R2MLZWOSNHXEL6,"really loud and you can turn it down but its still loud... and on top of it the sound buttons are right where the kids play and are easy to push so they turn it right back up to really, really, really loud even if you turn it down.its also not designed great as far as educationally."
R2MLZWOSNHXEL6,"the letters and numbers fit in but they only go in one way so unless the child knows that its not upside down, it wont fit."
R2MLZWOSNHXEL6,"this was frustrating for my toddler and in all reality, its basically an expensive pushing bus with little pieces to sort.now if you dont mind any of that, then the educational aspects are great."
R2MLZWOSNHXEL6,if you are willing to sit with your child and do it with him they would totally love it and you could help them.
R2MLZWOSNHXEL6,"it has several different games, phonics, letter recognition,music... just a blast if you dont mind it literally blasting at you."
R2MLZWOSNHXEL6,lol

R2J4SS37J7P2BF,my baby used to stare at it for the longest time.

R2O49UY9WPCLJS,this game is fun to play  with family or friends  as long as everyone has a good sense of humor about language or other offensive material like drawings.
R2O49UY9WPCLJS,"we played it this weekend with family and have played it with friends before and it gets a great laugh, its competitive and gives everyone a chance to play unlike some other games that can skip people repeatedly."

R3OP1LGEJ62DOM,super fun game the provides lots of laughs.

R3OP1LGEJ62DOM,stare into the abyss of cards against humanity and watch as it stares back.
R3OP1LGEJ62DOM,highly recommended card game to play.
R2I1WSJVZQKSGR,"when this arrived in the mail there were squeals of delight from my 5 year old twins!this game is designed for 47 yearolds, but i suspect that it is better suited for 46 yearolds.there are several minigames available to choose from within this winter festival."
R2I1WSJVZQKSGR,"one of my girls preferred the ice skating game that asks players to put numbers in the proper sequence, and then anna or elsa skates along the pattern."
R2I1WSJVZQKSGR,both girls loved helping anna and elsa to leap and turn.my other daughter loved the ice sculpting minigame.
R2I1WSJVZQKSGR,"she enjoyed seeing the geometric shapes morph into the sculptures.all in all, this is a fun and educational game."
R2I1WSJVZQKSGR,"i am enjoying seeing the girls &34level up&34 and watching the game adjust for their individual strengths.my older, gamer, sons like to point out that the game is not overly sophisticated."
R2I1WSJVZQKSGR,"but i point out that this is a system built from the ground up for kids their sisters age, and not an adult console made to work for younger kids.i would prefer a faster processing speed, but i think that is my adult impatience shining through.disclosure i was provided a copy of this game in order to facilitate my review."
R2I1WSJVZQKSGR,"however, all opinions are 100 my own and i was not required to give a positive review."
R3TDOJX09IV9EE,my grandson saw the latest movie of despicable me and enjoyed it very much.
R3TDOJX09IV9EE,he happens to love working on puzzles with characters that he knows and loves.
R3TDOJX09IV9EE,"he is 6 years old and we have boxes of puzzels all over his house, of which many pieces are missing."
R3TDOJX09IV9EE,when this arrived he was so pleased it had a perfect container for this puzzle.
R3TDOJX09IV9EE,"he works on it a few times a week, and after he gently puts the pieces back where they belong."
R3TDOJX09IV9EE,"we also put it on a special shelf, where some of his games are stored."
R3TDOJX09IV9EE,i do not think he will lose these pieces as the canister is too cute.
R1MI4QMPKQDCEZ,"beautiful doll, but she has a sticky hair"

R2ST9ZYL4D94HH,"sometimes, i just let it hang in the air, menacingly."
R2ST9ZYL4D94HH,very impressive all around performance.
R3AK2DJUG47171,mistaken ordered this didnt realize it was a child size glove.
R3AK2DJUG47171,returned and purchased the adult size.
R3J3J0ESDS506G,only downside is outdoors it is so light that sometimes it takes all its power just to maintain position against the wind.
R1HGG1Q6Y6ICOE,the tactic624 receivers was a great buy.
R1HGG1Q6Y6ICOE,they have been working great in my skysurfer airplane along with the tactic 650 transmitter that i also bought.
R2Z7Z0HEV3DKIR,i love doing this metal models and this is such a beautiful addition to my collection.
R2Z7Z0HEV3DKIR,was a medium challenge to put together.
R2Z7Z0HEV3DKIR,the only thing is the top piece with is supposed to be the lines running across the ship are very delicate so you have to be careful with them and if you mess with it you the multiple lines get crushed.
R2Z7Z0HEV3DKIR,if this does happen to you finish building the ship and them use the tip of a pen to separate them by running the tip between the lines.
R2Z7Z0HEV3DKIR,altogether a great product that i would recommend this anyone and everyone.
R20G4P2VW8ZFV8,"my niece love, love, loves monster high, i find myself buying monster high dolls a couple of times a year."
R20G4P2VW8ZFV8,unfortunately buying the dolls one at a time can seriously add up.
R20G4P2VW8ZFV8,"so when i saw this set of five, for a really good price like the price of two dolls normally priced, i knew i had to get this for her."
R20G4P2VW8ZFV8,honestly my biggest complaint is the box is soooo big that finding a good sized shipping box for it to fit into was a pain in the butt.
R20G4P2VW8ZFV8,"but other than that it is the perfect present for my adorable little niece, and she adored it."
R20G4P2VW8ZFV8,its always great to be the favorite aunt.

RAYIQBQP8OPMV,just turned 5 and she is still playing with it.
R16UIAXFW2PWJX,took soooo long to get them.
R16UIAXFW2PWJX,they were a little smaller than i thought they would be.
R6W4M9ZPM57OU,"the ones i received only hold a ""charge"" for about two minutes."
R6W4M9ZPM57OU,"i bought them for my sons room as he has troubles falling asleep in the dark, but unfortunately these dont last very long."
R6W4M9ZPM57OU,and they constantly fall off as the adhesive isnt strong enough.
R3NMQJGYYBQME2,a okay

R2POA1VXXASVZ3,similar to game &34scatch&34 that was popular several years ago.
R2POA1VXXASVZ3,this set of velcro ball and discs to catch work great.
R2POA1VXXASVZ3,my son and ihave found this a great way to play catch and have fun.
R2POA1VXXASVZ3,"the ball sticks well to the disc and makes a &34pop&34 sound  like a baseball glove.simple, but a good game for the price.would recommend for family gathering or just with a young person or friend to have a good time."
R1CG21PT5EZTWX,my five yearold daughters and my thirtysomething yearold husband loved putting this together.

R393LZTKLT1RP1,videoida48c0da2385c63d3d8bc851a2e738a7athis is great for older kids who collect things and love stickers and football.
R393LZTKLT1RP1,my son was matching up stickers with grandpa when i did the review he is super camera shy so dont mind the one word answers.
R393LZTKLT1RP1,he had a ball though and i think grandpa more funny telling him about each player than putting the stickers where they go.
R393LZTKLT1RP1,it was a great bonding experience.
R393LZTKLT1RP1,"i recommend it for anyone who like football, wants to collect football stuff or just wants to learn about the players."
R393LZTKLT1RP1,i got this at a discount for my unbiased review.
R1EDJVEW0FXE0K,"this is a cute plushie, and my daughter is thrilled to have a stuffed version of her favorite inside out character, but i really didnt pick up much of a cotton candy smell, and the candycrying effect, while clever, wasnt especially noticeable."
R1EDJVEW0FXE0K,"you have to squeeze really hard to get him to talk, too."
R1EDJVEW0FXE0K,"this is a cute toy, but the bellsandwhistles were nothing to write home about."
R1WMT3D1UBPAMB,they were great for what we wanted them for and held up much better than expected in a 12 mile an hour wind.
R1E4TO01RHTMYZ,"was expecting more instruction, not a kit."
R3HL1INRHXV58K,i love these puzzles.
R3HL1INRHXV58K,they are a thicker puzzle.
R3HL1INRHXV58K,"you have no picture to look for the answer of what piece goes where, you have to use your brain."
R3HL1INRHXV58K,"you have to find size and color, you have think."
R3HL1INRHXV58K,i love it.
R3UA4CS1D8FKCW,great add to collection.
R3QEADIUCR50FM,i never did get it to fly.
R3QEADIUCR50FM,"eveything worked, but the electric motor would not run."
R3QEADIUCR50FM,i called the company it came from and they wanted me to try some different procedures to try to fix it.
R3QEADIUCR50FM,"about that time, my dog stepped on the wing and broke it."
R3QEADIUCR50FM,probably not returnable now!
R3QEADIUCR50FM,kicked the dog in the butt and the plane went into the trash can.
R3QEADIUCR50FM,another day in paradise!

R1TO15TIGK04G,using it as a brain burner activity rather than competitive game.
R1TO15TIGK04G,"great ""conversation"" starter at family gathering."

R1TO15TIGK04G,"pretty fun, can be played noncompetively and very leisurely."
R1238CMYVP3021,"while i shudder at the thought of playing with nasty creepy crawlers now, i can remember as a young boy being fascinated with whatever i managed to dig up, scoop up, catch in a jar, etc."

R27YUVUXRBE5EL,we had a blast putting it together!
R27YUVUXRBE5EL,will definitely purchase more from this company.
R1GME5W7OC5V47,"fun puzzle, but it seems like it could fall apart really easily."
RO3959RNG3E77,i love my password vault but for one flaw that i have discovered the hard way.... if you delete an entry it is very likely that you will also delete an entry near it without being aware that you have.
RO3959RNG3E77,"after buying this device for myself and five of my family members, i sadly experienced the loss of my credit union password info  this being my only bank while deleting a master card password."
RO3959RNG3E77,both entries started with ma.
RO3959RNG3E77,i read other reviews on amazon then and found others have had this happen to them.
RO3959RNG3E77,"i still love my password vault but will caution my family members to only edit entries, never delete."
R17F454BMK27MK,kids and dog love it
R15I48I9TWCEZG,"first, my 5 yr old loves the different animated talking mcqueen different sounds for about 5 seconds each time when snooze button was pressed at &34press and try&34 while the clock was still in its packaging."
R15I48I9TWCEZG,"but when we actually tried to use it as an alarm clock, it has the mcqueen animated talking sound as alarm as intended, but guess what, that sound only lasted approx 5 seconds and then the alarm shuts off on its own."
R15I48I9TWCEZG,"which is useless to us because 5 seconds of animated talking did nothing to wake my child up.i was hoping the clock would have all those included different animated talking sounds repeated continuously until snooze button was pushed to snooze it and repeat again after 10 mnts or so, like normal alarm clock does."
R15I48I9TWCEZG,"unfortunately, this clock only make one 5second animated sound and its not loud at all and shuts off."
R15I48I9TWCEZG,"at this point, even a regular beeping alarm clock would work better, at least it will keep beeping until its snoozed or turned off manually.other than that, the clock is cute and attractive, thus the 2 stars."
R15I48I9TWCEZG,"too bad its not an efficient actual alarm clock, or it would have been perfect for my son who loves cars."
R3GP4VFH4NTLX,as advertised
R3UXHXGBKI16CX,my son loves this hat!
R3UXHXGBKI16CX,he play league of legends and the hat was a good quality.
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,i got this black top hat for my three year old son.
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,he absolutely loves it.
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,i was curious and kind of nervous if it would last being played with by a three year old and one year old but one week down and it is still all in one piece.
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,so yes it is actually very durable to my surprise!
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,he is 29 lbs and it fits him just fine whenever it is tilted just a little bit.
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,he didnt seem bothered one bit by the size.
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,he ran around the house the other day with it on playing.
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,what a great addition to our &34dress up&34 items!
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,this would also be a great hat for a magician costume for halloween or a circus themed birthday party.
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,that is what i told my husband and we were thinking about my son dressing up as a magician for my friends daughters circus themed birthday parties at the end of the month.
RWKOI2PWD7HOG,i will provide pictures in this review of my 3 year old in this hat.i received a deep discount on this product to provide an honest and unbiased review.
R18KJDHNC20PV8,i bought these to add to the gift i was giving my bridal party at my wedding.
R18KJDHNC20PV8,"we had an outdoor wedding in august, and i thought pink bandanas would be cute."
R18KJDHNC20PV8,they are huge and super thin.
R18KJDHNC20PV8,"they got the job done, but they were kinda iffy quality."
R18KJDHNC20PV8,i dont think they would absorb any liquid if you actually tried.
R70ZC71C836S1,"cute toddler table, fairly easy to put together... my only issue is that one of the corners of the table was a little damaged but i didnt want to go thru the hassle of returning it and its not too noticeable so whatever... i dont know if it was delivery that damaged it or it was sent like that so ill give it five stars because it really is a cute little table."

R1BVI3Y9RUIVPM,my 6 year old daughter absolutely loves this.
R1BVI3Y9RUIVPM,it keeps her busy after school and she loves making personalized bracelets for every one she loves.
R1BVI3Y9RUIVPM,mybonly complaint is the snaps dont stay snapped very well and the bracelet falls off easily.
R1W6KUQRBY8QSR,great fun for all ages.
R1W6KUQRBY8QSR,all the pieces connect easily and made out of good plastic.
R1W6KUQRBY8QSR,my 4 year old loves it.
R2LYE1EEMXBNJM,my son loved it.
R2LYE1EEMXBNJM,it was easy to put together.
R2LYE1EEMXBNJM,amazing how this thing knows when to turn and not to fall off.

R2KD9AF0PI9F1J,very stylish helmet  i basically bought it because i really wanted a pink helmet and liked the pink  black color combination.
R2KD9AF0PI9F1J,"i honestly wasnt expecting much for the very low price, but im glad i bought it."
R2KD9AF0PI9F1J,"have used it several times now, and it is very comfortable and the dial helps to get the right fit."
R2KD9AF0PI9F1J,the vents really keep my hair drier than previous helmets.
R2KD9AF0PI9F1J,i hardly notice i am even wearing it when riding.
R2KD9AF0PI9F1J,a good buy.
R259PAIO3Q9D1H,good.

R2XIWZRNQMBUK,i got this as a xmas gift for my sister and she fell in love it it.
R2XIWZRNQMBUK,it really is big.
R2XIWZRNQMBUK,it was just as described.
R2XIWZRNQMBUK,the only problem is it is not really strong material so it ended up breaking pretty easy.
R2XIWZRNQMBUK,it was good while it lasted but you just have to be super careful with it.
R2XIWZRNQMBUK,if i were to buy one again i would look for one that would not break so easy.
R14PB0FIM507IB,"fun product, need to hold cards down when spinning"
R27B988A01G4FD,"the pieces come apart a bit too easily, but thats nothing a little kragle cant fix!"
R27B988A01G4FD,"overall, my kids loved them and couldnt tell they were generic."
R6PCTUO7MR7AM,"dreamblade is a fun game on its own, but i have found a lot of chances to use these figures in games of the whispering vault."
R6PCTUO7MR7AM,the twisted aesthetic of a lot of these figures works well with that.
R23SH8W7TI5UK7,love the bag was bigger than i expected came out great
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,"its durable, hefty and it looks good."
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,it plays well too.
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,"and it comes with everything you need to install it.of course, its designed around a square restrictor gate."
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,it even comes with one.
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,"so if you are like me, and prefer the feel of an octagonal restrictor gate, theres going to be a learning curve."
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,"when you switch gates like that, you end up losing roughly half of the diagonal sensitivity, because of the way the microswitches are placed."
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,"so while you have a smoother overall motion, you need to be very deliberate in hitting all of the directions.now this isnt a knock against the joystick, even though it may seem like it."
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,this is more of a warning to anyone who might be thinking of switching the gate out.
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,"and even then, the replacement gates are pretty cheap, and take about 20 seconds to install."
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,"im still quite happy i put one of these in my arcade stick, because they feel great to use, and it contrasts well with my black case.so as far as im concerned, this is the best joystick ive used."
R3F5LOVDV3LCV2,just maybe do some research if you want to swap out restrictor gates on it.
R3VH88O6PTIU9L,love it
R2SR97X1DXUX1T,great details!
R2SR97X1DXUX1T,luckily i received the color i wanted..red!
R3NBIGWMEXN7JY,i love this.
R3CN4YPJVTDF16,"granddaughter loves these, only problem is that she turns us into walking sticker holders when she isnt using them in the books hahabought all the series that they had for her."
R3CN4YPJVTDF16,she spends hours playing with them
R2MDI1TP46VSYD,once put together the castle is good.
R2MDI1TP46VSYD,our 6 year old grandson loves it.
R2MDI1TP46VSYD,putting it together is another story.
R2MDI1TP46VSYD,the pieces are separated into bags like the lego sets but the likeness stops there.
R2MDI1TP46VSYD,there is no purpose to the bags.
R2MDI1TP46VSYD,"pieces for the castle are spread among all the bags, even the ones that look like they are for the figures."
R2MDI1TP46VSYD,the directions pictures of the small pieces are very small and it is hard to distinguish some of them.
R2MDI1TP46VSYD,would suggest playmobile takes some lessons from lego.
R3LBD41XV3852R,best family game for children of different ages.
R3LBD41XV3852R,so much fun that even 4 year olds get into the action.
R308ST3NY4O9C9,i have an 8 year old son that weighs 90 lbs.
R308ST3NY4O9C9,the costume stated that large fits most 810 years olds.
R308ST3NY4O9C9,it is pretty big and also is lengthy.
R308ST3NY4O9C9,it looks like it can fit up to a 12 year old.
R308ST3NY4O9C9,i still kept it because other than size its a pretty cool costume.
R308ST3NY4O9C9,"if you have an 8 year old at 90 lbs, you may want to get a medium because if large was like extra large then the medium must fit like a large."
R1QWWU5AG6NKKC,fell off the bathtub and broke within a week.
R1YI0Y6KE3470H,"this set is fabulous, the grandkids love it!"
R1YI0Y6KE3470H,fairly easy for an adult to put together.

R2F9INCGQTONK0,my son started playing with this as soon as he had good head control on his stomach.
R2F9INCGQTONK0,when he started crawling he always would go crawl up to it and play with it and now that hes standing up and sitting he still finds a lot of interest in this toy!
R2F9INCGQTONK0,even with all his other options this toy is still enticing.
R2F9INCGQTONK0,the music and sounds it makes arent annoying either and wont drive you crazy!
R25TUKN10A00D3,"my 18 month old is young for the recommended ages on the package, but with his older sister helping him it was a toy they could use."
R25TUKN10A00D3,"however, this is a toy that has fewer features and learning functions that some of the learning intense products offered by leapfrog."
R25TUKN10A00D3,it is a fun toy for smaller children to learn about tools and measurements in a tactile manner.
R9E3GS09W0V3U,i couldnt be happier with my purchase!
R9E3GS09W0V3U,there was an error in the original listing but the seller was great and we got it straightened out.

R30Y72Y548AA2X,i love them!
R221PCYTHYFDWA,"this game can be fun if you have friends that like to nerd it out and argue over ambiguous definitions of words in the ruleson the cards, but it can be fairly confusing keeping track of which actionsabilities take effect at what time... for example, certain minions ability say if they get ""destroyed"" then something happens, but the rules dont explicitly state what qualifies as ""destroyed"" is it any time they go to the discard pile per another cards action, or when a base scores, is it only when the action explicitly says ""destroy this minion"", or does it also include when they ""go back into the owners hand"" per another action cardminion ability?"
R221PCYTHYFDWA,"its fun to see how different pairs of decks mesh, but some overpower others, and different combinations of rules make some cards completely useless."
R221PCYTHYFDWA,"players who havent played smash up before are in for some confusion the first couple rounds, but if youre not in it for competition but just to see what happens, itll work out."
R14K21JP2Z7I4C,this item could not even be considered to be called a complete product for market.
R14K21JP2Z7I4C,out of 2 items received both arrived defective due to absolutely absent quality control.
R14K21JP2Z7I4C,it would be a shame to be presented as a gift for fellow chess lovers due to poor craftsmanship.
R14K21JP2Z7I4C,made with poor quality from cheap unfinished wood pieces in first place this item does not worth time and hassle to go through return process.
R14K21JP2Z7I4C,garbage.
R2MPST59CC0RIH,great swing.
R2MPST59CC0RIH,my granddaughter loves it!
R2MPST59CC0RIH,and it is a perfect fit for small people .

R26VC64YYSOJL3,great
R1QSUN0F23VMXG,its really good one.
R1QSUN0F23VMXG,only drawback is it works in indoor and once charged it can fly update to 10 mins
R1QQ8V3NNI4KOE,my grandson liked the scope alot.
R1QQ8V3NNI4KOE,it makes noise which all boys love.
R1DZR8QVAIOTGP,the playing chips are too small and cheaply made.not really worth this price.i was hoping for something of better quality
R1PUPI0UKAXKKF,doesnt look like the gold color mentioned in the description or like the picture..
R2S5GUS9GXM8BZ,fun.
R2S5GUS9GXM8BZ,good for all ages.
R2S5GUS9GXM8BZ,can create many of your own games.

R2ITQ6HPJ438GO,good.
R3CKM8Y9HAJC7S,christmas toy for my 2 yr old grandson.
R3CKM8Y9HAJC7S,he loves it and so does his 4 year old sister.
R1NA3ZF53VS9ER,my first model like this.
R1NA3ZF53VS9ER,yes it has to be put together and the instructions are not in english at all.
R1NA3ZF53VS9ER,just bring up the amazon pic and go from there.
R1NA3ZF53VS9ER,it has lots of spare parts so you can configure it different ways.
R1NA3ZF53VS9ER,watch the needles on the figure pretty sure theyre real.
R1NA3ZF53VS9ER,if not they are so close to the real things its uncanny
R1O4LMCH20X6VV,poor quality
R2N4EGF1WNIZ6Y,i built the robot and this was a fun build.
R2N4EGF1WNIZ6Y,for the price was worth it.
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,its tough to convey the amount of game design and gameplay potential thats in this.
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,"if you like chucking dice, card games adapted to other mediums, or combination dicecard games, this is your sandbox.nice, large, wellengravedpainted dice."
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,"goal cards are tiny, but theyre only goal cards  nobody really handles the cards that much."
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,score chips are passable.these dice are made to fulfill poker and rummy requirements.
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,"if you roll all 9, you will get a decenttooutstanding hand with every roll."
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,"theyre great gamedesign tools, the normal game is great, adaptations of other card games ive played on these were great."
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,"basically, greatness.edit over a year later, this is still my mostplayed dice game."
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,i own two sets now engraved one set with a dot to tell them apart and have adapted canasta to the dice.
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,people love it!
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,"the dice are my favorite dice, and have been since i got them."
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,the engravings and printing on them are topnotch and dont wear away.
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,this is one of two dice games whose dice i consider to be of heirloom quality  suitable for just about anyone who appreciates this sort of thing.
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,"the inclusion of the jokers does necessitate some rules to deal with them for games that dont use them, but beyond that, youll never run out of new ways to play with these."
R3D8DWQA1B6R1J,"i have a lot of dice that take after card decks, and these have the most effort put into their design and workmanship."
R71H0ILUX5OP6,get what you pay for...the drone i got had a slight pull to one side straight out of the box that i couldnt correct with the trim button at all and after about 4 flights one of the rotors has stopped spinning all together.
R71H0ILUX5OP6,that minus the missing charger and id say spend your money on a better product.
R71H0ILUX5OP6,having to borrow a charger with a new product was bad enough but a dead rotor after a handful of flights and id say its junk!
R71H0ILUX5OP6,!
R3QAJ0B1J1GF0I,absolutely love this color.
R3QAJ0B1J1GF0I,great product.
R3QAJ0B1J1GF0I,i switched to this from the normal version of this color and i like how this is holding up in comparison.

R1866GIGPEC0KN,one of my girls favorite toys.
R1KMGPIJMRITSS,"this game is fun for a little while, but quickly gets old."
R17KBCO3IP646P,i bought this for my granddaughters 3rd birthday.
R17KBCO3IP646P,"it was a little challenging for me to figure out how to put it together, but not bad."
R17KBCO3IP646P,i thought it looked nice and sturdy and i was pleased with my purchase.
R17KBCO3IP646P,it turned out that the newly threeyearold later felt compelled to bite the cushion on the handle.
R17KBCO3IP646P,"i didnt witness this myself, but heard that it was torn to the point that her mom removed the cushion completely."
R17KBCO3IP646P,...wish i could have the chance to see that predamaged cushion on the handle again to see how it succumbed to a childs mouth so easily.
R17KBCO3IP646P,"obviously, it was not intended to be a chew toy."
R2AWBID063OPDI,love these
RISRSEAWJHGF1,i didnt know that this project lab still exists after seeing it in a radio shack 1992 catalog.
RISRSEAWJHGF1,it was great to be a child again assembling circuits with electronics parts.
RISRSEAWJHGF1,the terminals save you having all the electronic parts scattered around after some time playing with all the circuits described in the included manual.
RISRSEAWJHGF1,recommended for initiating your child in the world of electronics and digital circuits.
R26GO8P4V133H5,steering wheel doesnt stay on and horn barely beeps.
R244FS45YHZE3A,"very happy with the product,brilliant detail."

RNQ6C5UEOXQ2L,"buy a pair of inline skates or go to a skating ring instead, way better."
R2TB49TZ6T6S3T,"bought this for a surprise birthday party, i was pleasantly surprised with how thick the sign was and the metal reinforcements on the corners to help with hanging it up."
R2TB49TZ6T6S3T,"very happy, would purchase again if i needed to."
R3H54PSPHI1RIL,"great experience, card arrived promptly and in a perfect fit sleeve."
R2VFFZDOHHX92K,i was pleased with the product.

R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,my granddaughter loves her cozy coup.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,i was so excited when my daughter got this for her daughter  as i have many fond memories of both of my children playing with their cozy coups when they were toddlers.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,"the design hasnt changed a lot in the over 25 years since my kids had these  i guess if something isnt broke, dont fix it."
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,one nice feature about the newer models is they are taller and i am able to push my 18 month old granddaughter in her &34car&34 without it breaking my back.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,i am only 55&34 and i think anyone much taller then me would have to bend though.i put the coup together and used the online video instruction and it made the job very easy.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,i did it by myself and had no issues.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,i am a visual person so this was much better than the instruction manual.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,following the video stepbystep will assure you dont put anything together bassackwards .... you do not want to try and take this baby apart believe me.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,after i put it together we took it for a few spins in the house on the hardwood floors and one of the front wheels did not operate properly  it was kind of &34frozen&34 and wouldnt swivel like it should.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,i called little tikes and their rep was very friendly and helpful.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,once we took it outside on the concrete it worked perfectly.
R2YH4EAKDE6PT0,"couldnt get the necessary traction inside probably not an ideal inside toy anyway but with grandparents, we have a whole different set of rules than we did for our own kids lol!"

R2RJSSZHXBU542,well made and fun
RX6UJ0WJIS0UE,these are nothing like the large hard plastic balls youd find in a public ball pit.
RX6UJ0WJIS0UE,these are easily half the size.
RX6UJ0WJIS0UE,"i have a mini inflatable pool that only holds one toddler about 2.5 feet diameter, and i only have 20 or so balls left over."
RX6UJ0WJIS0UE,theyre very soft and compress with just a little pressure.
RX6UJ0WJIS0UE,so far they have popped back into the right shape.the colors are bright.
RX6UJ0WJIS0UE,the redpinkorange are very similar in shade.
RX6UJ0WJIS0UE,im not sure if i like these enough for the price i paid.

R2Q6NCCRM6Z9UL,good
RUU2QQ6APQEGW,this is a good first toy tool bench.
RUU2QQ6APQEGW,"if your child is hard on things, it may not be a good choice."
RUU2QQ6APQEGW,the legs on this are not the most sturdy.
RUU2QQ6APQEGW,"as the child gets older, a new, more sturdy toy bench will be needed."
RUU2QQ6APQEGW,"there are only 4 wood pieces, but its a good amount when your child tends to lose things!"
RUU2QQ6APQEGW,"overall, good little bench."
R3WKMGAQ8UE20,no problems

RWCFB6SQVI8XW,videoid8995a879ace10f830f08bed963d66b70 such fun!!!
RWCFB6SQVI8XW,ever since the video went viral on the internet earlier this summer of this awesome gadget i have been wanting to try it.
RWCFB6SQVI8XW,"when i was offered a chance to review this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review i jumped at the chance!"
RWCFB6SQVI8XW,!the only possible way to show you how easy and cool the bunch on balloons pack is  is to show you first hand.
RWCFB6SQVI8XW,i decided to video the entire process of setting it up for the first time.
RWCFB6SQVI8XW,"being so excited to try this, i barely skimmed the directions."
RWCFB6SQVI8XW,it seemed simple enough as the balloons are attatched to the bottom of skinny straws with a hose bracket on the top that will easily attach to your hose.
RWCFB6SQVI8XW,"simply attach the bunch to the hose and fill with the balloons on the ground, once you see they are at full capacity they will start to fall off on their own and you do a little jiggle to shake the rest off.the reason i am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is only because there was one or two balloons that were ripped and another balloon was still squirting out water from the top tie once it was released from the straws."
RWCFB6SQVI8XW,"but considering just how many balloons you get in this bunch i didnt mind at all.a bonus is, they email you a pdf of a bunch of games to play with the balloons, that is if you choose to not just throw them at any moving and non moving objects as soon as they are done filling."
R1I8C6Q3SPSH3E,my daughter loves playing.
R1I8C6Q3SPSH3E,shes already beating me.
R2JM687C525WR9,"cweve had the hue animation kit for a couple of years now and have really loved it asinb0049ttkeu hue animation studio red for windows pcs and apple mac os x complete stop motion animation kit with camera, software and book , so we were excited to give this new kit a go, curious to see if it had any added features or benefits."
R2JM687C525WR9,unfortunately weve been disappointed with it.1.
R2JM687C525WR9,"the camera is definitely of lower quality, it does not have a weighted base but instead a suction cup, and the head of the camera the end where all the functional stuff is and the lens is much heavier, so its quite top heavy."
R2JM687C525WR9,"the suction cup is not a good idea as it doesnt make up for a weighted base, especially since it doesnt stick to many surfaces."
R2JM687C525WR9,"weve not had any issues with the hue camera falling over and luckily it does not have a suction cup, but the animate it camera cannot stand on its own and must be suction attached to something."
R2JM687C525WR9,the quality of the images the camera in this animate it kit produces are not clear.
R2JM687C525WR9,"the hue camera can be focused directly by turning the lens, and while the camera on this kit has a lens that turns as well, we were not able to get it very clear."
R2JM687C525WR9,"it is interesting to note that on the animate it website & amazon page the image of the lens shows information written on the ring of the lens stating its resolution and zoom, however, the camera in the kit does not have any of this printed information."
R2JM687C525WR9,"i dont know if that indicates this has a different cameralens or not, but its definitely a poor quality one."
R2JM687C525WR9,"the hue camera also has a speaker built into the camera, so if you are doing audio voice over youre all set with the cameramicrophone allinone.2."
R2JM687C525WR9,this animate it kit comes with little plastic doohickeys the ogosportogobild things that you can create little creatures with as the subject of your animation.
R2JM687C525WR9,"my daughter was not at all interested in these, preferring instead to use clay our hue kit from a couple years ago came with clay, but the newer ones seem not to anymore, and instead include a klutz animation book."
R2JM687C525WR9,"this is just personal preference, but something to note."
R2JM687C525WR9,it seems to me that these plastic things might appeal to younger kids?
R2JM687C525WR9,"my daughter is 11.3. the software, while adequate for most kids, isnt as comprehensive as the hue animation software."
R2JM687C525WR9,it also doesnt have as good of instructions video instructions for the hue are really great and make each step to make animations very easy to figure out and do.
R2JM687C525WR9,"my daughter was 8 when we first used the hue kit and i did have to help her with some activities, especially some editing and splicing in music so the fade ins and outs were right where we wanted them, but once she got going she was very independent in creating her films.some folks have mentioned that they dont feel the software with this animate it kit is limited its called animate it express because it has less features than their fully fledged animate it software however, it doesnt offer all the features you can do on the hue software, esp."
R2JM687C525WR9,"related to editing, splicing in music, having different audio tracks, etc."
R2JM687C525WR9,its just much more basic.
R2JM687C525WR9,"many kids may be happy with the more basic software, but once youve had more control and options for your animations its hard to give some of that up.4."
R2JM687C525WR9,"price  the price of this kit is definitely less than the hue kit, but also bear in mind that the hue has a longer history and has won all kinds of awards, is used in schools, and overall has a much better camera and full featured software."
R2JM687C525WR9,"i think if your kid is 10, andor really into animation theyll be much happier with the hue kit."
R2JM687C525WR9,"younger kids may be just fine with this kit although the camera will frustrate you no matter what your age.summary based on our experience with both this kit and the hue kit, the hue is the clear winner for overall quality and features and i think for learning to use it, but thats subjective and others may feel the software for this animate it kit is just as easyut thats subjective and others may feel the software for this animate it kit is just as easy"

RI5EJXG63LAY8,"the lettered side of the scrabble black plastic pro grade tiles is perfectly smooth, so there is no way to &34feel out&34 a letter or blank if youre picking them from a bag."
RI5EJXG63LAY8,"they also shuffle around well, if youre sliding them around on a flat surface or in the box top."
RI5EJXG63LAY8,"i like the holes in the back of the tiles, it makes them easy to grip and move them around easier.while were not big game players around here, we are big time crafters."

RI5EJXG63LAY8,i had no idea we could buy just the tiles!
RI5EJXG63LAY8,imagine my excitement when we found the scrabble tiles made by max tiles.

R32WIU4IXDZNW9,"also, the rules are surprisingly complicated not hard, just cumbersome for such a juvenile game."
R32WIU4IXDZNW9,"all in all, we played it with a bunch of pottymouthed adults and had fun, but we only played one round and moved on to better games for the night."
R32WIU4IXDZNW9,"my younger brother and his collegeaged friends do enjoy it, though, so it seems audience dependent to large extent."
R29U5CU9TENJ2K,"the quality of this card shock me, when i opened the mail the card was in great condition."

R2JNOFP7YQ06AH,very cute mini versions for the lovely 18in doll clothes.
R2JNOFP7YQ06AH,"the only thing that would make them better would be notches on the arms to ""catch"" the clothes or hang straps from... but they are the perfect size and the wood is smooth and metal fits tightly in the wood so they seem to be very well made."
RW0A0PDNVZHF4,"quite a few people ask where i got the pin and ask if they can touch it theyve seen the movie.... i tell them hes, but they may end up in a field or else battling evil robots!"
RW0A0PDNVZHF4,!

R1C22O25SPZPPY,these dinosaurs are terrible.
R1C22O25SPZPPY,the assortment shown is not what you get.
R1C22O25SPZPPY,"theyre cheap looking, several are ugly bright neon colors, some dinos are missing or you get a duplicate, and to top it all if, they wont actually stand, which is guaranteed to piss off your kids."
R1C22O25SPZPPY,"i was going to return them, but my kid found them first and, being only 2, his standards are low."
R1C22O25SPZPPY,"but, within minutes he had a frustrated meltdown over the fact that they wont stand, and so any that didnt have 4 legs went in the trash."
R1C22O25SPZPPY,which meant 6 of them.
R1C22O25SPZPPY,"so now, i have 6 crappy, cheap dinos that i cant return.basically, dont buy these, they suck."

R19MP6Q8IR5T1D,"maybe mine is defective, but when we tried to postpone our game and fold the board, all the tiles came loose and fell out and we lost our game."
R19MP6Q8IR5T1D,i thought maybe we just didnt push them into place hard enough but that isnt the case we tried!
R19MP6Q8IR5T1D,the tiles are just a little too small and dont lock into place like they should.
R19MP6Q8IR5T1D,basically what i hoped to be travel scrabble is just stayinoneplace scrabble.
R19MP6Q8IR5T1D,bummer!
R392CMDQND1LD5,excellent quality
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,these little plastic balls have me baffled.
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,i received our box as part of a promotion.
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,"the box shows some pretty neat items made with them, although my 5 year old and i could not replicate any."
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,my daughter does have a ball with these.
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,she makes all kind of funny creatures.
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,she gets frustrated when she cant bring over her creation because it falls apart before getting to me.
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,but this doesnt stop her from playing with them.
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,it did me.
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,i am not a fan of this toy.
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,i give it 3 stars because my daughter is still enjoying them after 3 weeks.
R1E1EFST1JJOO2,i wouldnt purchase these for anyone.
R13J12N3N1IJWU,so cute

R39KF220XHB8HV,it is soft and the perfect touch.
R15ASA2MLDPIIV,was far smaller than i anticipated even after having read the size.
R15ASA2MLDPIIV,it did not fit what i had purchased and i ended up having to use some tissue paper to wrap but the recipient liked the bag .
R3HVLBBX1OTF3C,chintzy.
R286U5FOEUNTBE,my child love the story book
R2PER0137ZDA5G,beautiful!
R2PER0137ZDA5G,!
R22C975E0SEAOZ,"my 9year old son went to target with $18 burning a hole in his pocket and he picked out this nerf blaster.i wasnt sure how well the gun would shoot since its only cocked using a hammer like youd see on a cowboy gun, but it provides plenty of power.cocking the hammer can be done easily onehanded and even my son or 7year old daughter has no problems with it.it has a paint scheme that gives it that &34zombie&34 feel and the grip itself feels good in the hand.ill admit, i wasnt sold on the idea of cocking it using the hammer, but its very easy to do one handed and if you had another one of these guns you could easily go akimbo dualwield.what i thought would make this gun not so fun to shoot has turned into the thing that i like most about it.....the cocking hammer.this is a great nerf gun...5 shots that can be unleashed onehanded."
R22C975E0SEAOZ,whats not to love?
R18LVSDW213DN,"seekingtag colorful led flash bracelet, pack of 10 for review fun, nothing like adding a little fun and light life to the party, everyone will love you and the bracelets, you an turn them on and off when you want."
R18LVSDW213DN,im not sure but i think if you are careful you may even be able to change batteries if needed.
R18LVSDW213DN,there is a small variety of colors to help keep everyone happy a great addition to any occasion
ROJLJDCS47MVV,"the plastic is a little thinner than i would have liked, but good for the price."
ROJLJDCS47MVV,these are less expensive than at my local asian grocery stores and about the same quality.
R1K9DCD4NDDIJF,cool looking beanie
R3BSIWWRCLZJIT,purchased for my daughters to use in the pool for sunbathing.

R2X5V3494F4CPA,this grill is so cute!!

R2X5V3494F4CPA,pretty good quality and fairly quick assembly.
R3ND0LTYWA4CHO,great for a carnival game!
R3ND0LTYWA4CHO,they worked really well.
R21KDG29JGYI6H,kids excited to make rainbows with this.
R21KDG29JGYI6H,"little tricky to get just right... all chalks need to be ""even"" to draw, but its an arch, so they are not really the same amount sticking out."
R21KDG29JGYI6H,"outer colors stick out more than middle... just need to get used to adjusting, especially with chalk wearing down quickly."
R3G3QBMUOC8OBF,excellent product .
R3G3QBMUOC8OBF,recommended seller
R2225FCWAKG207,"definitely a great concept, but we found that we had a lot of balloons just fall off without being filled up."
R2225FCWAKG207,"we ended up having to pick up the balloons and put them back on the little ""straws"" to refill them."
R2225FCWAKG207,the balloons also leaked fairly quickly.
R2225FCWAKG207,still saved a lot of time and i was glad i didnt have to fill up hundreds of balloons by hand.
R1G0TSHT33GO3Q,i looked high and low for these exact little crosses and i was so happy to find them here!
R1G0TSHT33GO3Q,"i didnt want plastic, i didnt want metal, i didnt want them too big or too small."
R1G0TSHT33GO3Q,i needed crosses to pack in operation christmas child shoeboxes and these fit the bill perfectly.
R1G0TSHT33GO3Q,i love their handmade character and the slight variations in the wood in each.
R1G0TSHT33GO3Q,"excellent value for the money, will buy again, thank you!"
RB4GCQ9ZFGKK2,these is really cheap plastic.
RB4GCQ9ZFGKK2,the pieces dont fit together great.
RB4GCQ9ZFGKK2,"kids have fun with it, but it probably wont last long."
RGH48EKNZMK1B,nice little set.
RGH48EKNZMK1B,"8 year old liked, combined with other sets and pieces"
R1UHITWSSPMHPJ,i was pleased with the product.

R3RUXF0FZN2Y0O,my grand kids love this toy.
R3RUXF0FZN2Y0O,they especially love the abc music & always sing along with it.
R3MNPOXW0TKD5W,way too olio expensive for what it is.
R3MNPOXW0TKD5W,save your money and get a larger booster pack for the same price.
R3KV5JJ7BG3G3Z,this is cool.
RD26NAKX0ZUF4,my granddaughter loved it!
R1GKC2HVU2O9AX,love it my daughter looked so cute she normally hates headbands but this didnt bother her.
R1GKC2HVU2O9AX,as other people said i also got grey top and it could be a little more frilly at the bottom but overall i love it for the price
R1HECTX58KGNQZ,nice pretend play costume.
R1HECTX58KGNQZ,very durable and made well.
R35VZF58HGYLJV,very cute dress!
R35VZF58HGYLJV,my daughter loves it.
R35VZF58HGYLJV,the material is very soft.
R35VZF58HGYLJV,fits my 2 12 year old perfectly.
R20DAL4A9WN0HJ,"this is a great version of the leonard and sheldons living room as seen in american sitcom ""the big bang theory"", includes seven minifigures to assembly leonard, sheldon, penny, amy, raj, howard and bernadette, also includes the instructions but you can also download it from legos website."
R3FKEUWZQ6276B,excellent
RH5VX853PONZB,everything about the puzzle is great except for one thing.
RH5VX853PONZB,there are at least half a dozen places where the die cuts for a pieces protruding knob was offset so close to a side that the shoulder of the piece was only conneced by a very thin neck or was cut off of the piece completely.
RH5VX853PONZB,now all the fragments created by this poor die cutting were in the plastic bag of puzzle pieces and if you really tried you could a find them in the chaff and 2 carefully insert them into the puzzle.
RH5VX853PONZB,"even if you did, it is obvious to a puzzle person me!"
RH5VX853PONZB,that the resulting surface is flawed.
RH5VX853PONZB,"overall, poor quality control in the die cutting process results in a less than perfect puzzle."
R9VL2N6D1DLD6,great
R3PQR3H0KQNJ0Z,this pump is fantastic.
R3PQR3H0KQNJ0Z,cuts inflating and deflating time down by about 8090 compared to battery models.
R3PQR3H0KQNJ0Z,"it has attachments for the cheap ""floaties"", right up to the large multiperson float."
R3PQR3H0KQNJ0Z,it was a great purchase.
R3GU92P80GUE3O,great looking ball
R1IF8W3E47BH53,needs better clarification or instructions.
R1IF8W3E47BH53,theres no indication of what the switch does or is doing when selected.
R1IF8W3E47BH53,but i found out the switch pressed in disconnects the resistors.
R1IF8W3E47BH53,this is for using stock charger.
R1IF8W3E47BH53,the resistors are only needed when using a higher amp power supply.
R1IF8W3E47BH53,it does charge all batteries at the same time.
R1IF8W3E47BH53,the led indicates the voltage being applied.
R1IF8W3E47BH53,also the estimated charge time remaining.
R2O6PGFYYIF5VO,these are terribly made  the duster and mop fall apart quite easily  the yarn is barely glued in place.
R2O6PGFYYIF5VO,"mellissa and doug if you are out there, please do better!!"
R2O6PGFYYIF5VO,"i dont know what to do with ours other than put it in the trash at this point i have tried fixing, not possible... which means more junk in the landfill, after only being used lightly for a few months  terrible... parents, please keep looking for something that will not only last for your childs use, but ideally that can be passed on to others before ending up on the junk heap... sigh..."
RCKXLFFW24V6K,nice chess board is not included
R1TBVP6ATD4CEK,loved them for a joke the price was great
R3TOPFVC5DWHG5,my wife and i really enjoy the tv show arrow.
R3TOPFVC5DWHG5,its fun and its something we can watch together.
R3TOPFVC5DWHG5,she has a collection of bobble heads from star wars to guardians of the galaxy so i thought she would get a kick out of owning a little arrow.
R3TOPFVC5DWHG5,i was right.
R3TOPFVC5DWHG5,she loves it.
R3TOPFVC5DWHG5,i searched a few local stores who carrie them but they never had the hooded arrow so i got it from here and its now a permanent fixture on her desk at work.
R3TOPFVC5DWHG5,this is a fun toy its more for display then it is to play with.
R3DI5RKEWECRP4,great party decorations!
RBZJI3JZ5M2V1,"cute hat, pretty sturdy held up well for what i needed."

R2U7TB6CU6O8CG,my son was very excited to have a space to build with his legos.
R2U7TB6CU6O8CG,they line up perfectly together so he can build across the two sheets without a problem.
R3VY95P63EMA9N,"these diapers worked perfectly on my granddaughters 12"" dolls  even very old ones."
R3VY95P63EMA9N,the velcro is wonder.
R3VY95P63EMA9N,it helps the fit be exact no matter the size of the doll.
R3VY95P63EMA9N,"i wish they had them in some plain colors with just one little design or more feminine, but they work perfectly."
R12FL9UATUILEW,item as described.
R12FL9UATUILEW,box was in good condition.
R12FL9UATUILEW,item itself was a little stained on the body portion.
R12FL9UATUILEW,"was expecting something a little more pristine, especially considering the price, but i dont know if it was a manufacturer issue or something else."
R12FL9UATUILEW,"overall good transaction though, and i am happy with the item."

RFX4J4WHS5OEE,"bought these dice sets under the assumption that they were new, because, well, thats what the description said."
RFX4J4WHS5OEE,"the black set had no blemishes but the green set had numerous scuffs, scratches, dull points, and number ""touch ups""."
RFX4J4WHS5OEE,dont know what to make of the seller.
RFX4J4WHS5OEE,just want customers to be aware.
RI56L96SLWUY3,the best toy i could get to my boy who is obsessed with dinosaurs.
RI56L96SLWUY3,its big enough for him to carry it and the sound is great.
RI56L96SLWUY3,the images are not the best but they work for a kid.
R1N0XF4ISEHKEB,"my kids love making loom bracelets, these were not the best quality, they start to break and become cracked as soon as they are put into a bracelet."
R1N0XF4ISEHKEB,almost as if they were set out in the sun for days upon days and all they did was take them out of the bag and make bracelets.
R1N0XF4ISEHKEB,absolutely none of their bracelets have kept for more than a few hrs!
R2CSR9AT7ATJ8H,the kids love this toy.
R2CSR9AT7ATJ8H,it is easy to use.

R21ZJ4D7PO4LIS,"got one for my soninlaw too, he was surprised and excited he got one to play withmy granddaughter."
R1QVKBOIF9F296,i have the poster on the door of my office at an elementary school.

R1CRA47SQWB9ZN,"cards are nice and sturdy  but the photos on the front are very poor quality, very blurry, disappointed that this product is so lacking in the quality of the photos."

R19AI4DQWZUPBA,perfect for granddaughter
R1WK87ZUZ85O6I,"great set, careful about weight of the blocks, if your kid likes to stack high then knock over these can really hurt your toe or hand if played with on a hard surface."
R1WK87ZUZ85O6I,bigger blocks are heavy.
R1WK87ZUZ85O6I,otherwise very fun
R2ZB86ZX0W9SWT,stopped working after about 2 weeks.
R2ZB86ZX0W9SWT,my 3 year old still wears it daily even though it doesnt sing or light up anymore.
R2ZB86ZX0W9SWT,"its a cute dress.....kind of low in the chest area but she is small so maybe its just her plus, the picture of elsa is also the speaker which kind of weighs it down."
R2ZB86ZX0W9SWT,im sad it doesnt work anymore.
R2ZB86ZX0W9SWT,there are a lot of wires in there!
R2ZB86ZX0W9SWT,hard to figure out which one caused it to stop working.
R2ZB86ZX0W9SWT,"but, like i said, doesnt stop her from wearing it and feeling pretty!"
R39Y5MO4DTVIOD,i bought this as a photo prop for a carnival themed photo booth.
R39Y5MO4DTVIOD,i had my 7 year old try it on and it worked great.
R39Y5MO4DTVIOD,"the wig sheds, so i dont know how long it will hold up."
R39Y5MO4DTVIOD,"i wouldnt count on getting more than the party day out of it, but for the initial test run, it was vibrant, easy to wear, and a lot.of fun."
RA0UDCQMLKFK5,"cute little plushy, just what i needed for a cosplay."
R2VTKDJJT4M6E9,very nice.

R26AJI98FZSFYJ,perfect
R3TQPNZ56B7GUP,my 22 month old son absolutely loves this!
R3TQPNZ56B7GUP,it looks just like our dyson vacuum.
R3TQPNZ56B7GUP,there is an onoff switch in the back that turns on the suction that collects dirt in a tiny removeable tray in the back.
R3TQPNZ56B7GUP,it does work but its more for show its definitely not going to clean your house the red button on the front turns on the air that blows around the little foam pieces.
R3TQPNZ56B7GUP,my son usually just turns on that part when he vacuums with me.
R3TQPNZ56B7GUP,he keeps his vaccuum in the closet with ours and brings it out whenever im cleaning.
R3TQPNZ56B7GUP,we have had it for a few months and he still finds it very entertaining.
R3TQPNZ56B7GUP,we both love it
RISWIA0NIB2OC,pretty picture

R1IV6GOPHF2U5N,love it
R2OC82LW1HSWGJ,this was the perfect gift for my niece that just got interested in the pokemon card game and already has a few decks.
R2OC82LW1HSWGJ,"if you already have a deck this kit includes everything else youll need to play a full game damage counters, dice, rule book."
R2OC82LW1HSWGJ,i remember when i was a kid how much i loved opening a new pack and seeing what was inside.
R2OC82LW1HSWGJ,we opened a few of the packs when i gave them to her and each one had a hologram card inside!
R2OC82LW1HSWGJ,"in the 5 packs we opened we found one ex card, which i guess is a big deal, and a few common and uncommon foil cards."
R2OC82LW1HSWGJ,"this is a great gift for a kid that likes pokemon, and the box will keep it all organized so mom and dad arent getting in trouble for stepping on the cards."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"iron maiden has always featured eddie &34the head&34 on all of their album artwork, as well as in their stage performances."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"this particular eddie is represented on the album piece of mind.ive never owned one of the new neca mego styled figures, so i had no idea what to expect."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"im glad i got this one, he is quite an awesome figure.the sculpt of his head is a dead on representation of the album artwork, and the face is scary as it should be."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"every detail was paid attention too, down to the tiny screws holding the plate that holds his head together."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,this is one of the best head sculpts i have ever seen on an action figure.
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"the feet are sculpted equally grotesque, and they look appropriately eddie."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"from the knee up, however, he is a plain, flesh toned &34buck&34 body."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"his collar around his neck is very well sculpted as well, straight down to the tiny little lock that looks as though it holds it shut."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,it even features real metal chains attached to it.paint on eddie is fantastic.
RPHJGH50OQFFE,the face is so detailed that eddie appears to have crawled right out of the album artwork.
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"his teeth, tongue, eyes, and even the bit of blood dripping from his skull cap are expertly applied."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"the only thing that costs this figure points on paint is that neca have decided to &34shade&34 the head and collar like on the album artwork, and not on the clothes, so he looks to be half shaded."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"even with the jarring paint shading on his head and collar, he is still an amazing portrayal of eddie.the cloth clothes are very nice, in my opinion."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,his jeans are appropriately ripped and have been &34stained&34 to appear dirty.
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"the straightjacket is amazing, and has lots of straps on the back as it should."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"both the pants and straightjacket have velcro on them, and while the pants are easily removed, i can not see any way to take the straightjacket off without damaging it."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,looks like eddie is permanently restrained.the articulation on eddie is pretty good too.
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"he has a double ball jointed headneck that allows a nice range of motion, though it is a little tight."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"his legs have hinged hips, swivel thighs, hinged knees, and hinged ankles."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"the legs allow a nice range of motion, however it does feel slightly limited due to the cloth jeans."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"the upper body has a waist swivel, and the arms are as articulated as the legs."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,"the straightjacket however prevents most motion though, and while his arms are slightly movable, they will never have the range of articulation that other figures have.overall, this neca mego styled eddie, from the classic iron maiden album piece of mind, is a must have for fans of the band and these neca figures."
RPHJGH50OQFFE,highly reccomended.
R3GSUDPCDZXH9W,i have to say i purchased one of these when it originally came out and wasnt too impressed with how it works.
R3GSUDPCDZXH9W,they seem to have updated it though and this version works very well.
R3GSUDPCDZXH9W,it stays straight and flies under my childs hand.
R3GSUDPCDZXH9W,she has had hours of fun with it flying around our living room.
R3GSUDPCDZXH9W,the one conplaint i do have is that the base is very cheap.
R3GSUDPCDZXH9W,its just a flimsy piece of plastic but it does its job of standing the fairy up perfectly fine.
RK1GGLOQ4MENW,these are fabulous!
RK1GGLOQ4MENW,"i wish i had bought the bigger set, i am so mad at myself!"
RK1GGLOQ4MENW,"do i have to buy each piece separately now, the remaining 32 colors?"
RK1GGLOQ4MENW,i wish they also came in sets.
RK1GGLOQ4MENW,"the colors are so pure and clear, the pens are fabulous to hold!"
RK1GGLOQ4MENW,they feel weightless.
RK1GGLOQ4MENW,just love them
RLQYEVCXB3UUW,love it.
RLQYEVCXB3UUW,"i havent had time to remove it from the box, but i cant wait."
RLQYEVCXB3UUW,im hoping to pose it with the batman figure.

R36SHWRU304RJM,"my son just 3 year old loves this toy is fun for everyone, but more important is that it increases the intelligence of children, my son spends hours looking to make new shapes with his fingers, i guess that makes the child more creative and spend quality time with other children trying to teach him how to use it i hope to continue doing this type toys"
R6UCIPE49LFUA,this was a nice kit and easy to put together as party favors for my sons birthday party.
R6UCIPE49LFUA,i added a mixture if a few candies into the gift bag as well.

R39VT705OZ67X3,"ive never liked scrabble because i dont think i have a very extensive vocabulary, but with this game you can win with just 3 and 4 letter words."
R39VT705OZ67X3,highly recommended.
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,my daughter has poor fine motor skills that involves her not being able to write with ease.
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,her occupational therapist recommended that she uses short pencils to write with.
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,she told me to think of the ones used for golf.
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,"when i switched her to them, i did notice an improvement with her writing."
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,"one day, while i was casually browsing crayola product on amazon, i came across these."
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,i was so excited that i immideately purchased them for my daughter and i to use.
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,"she loves them, as do i. she can finally color without breaking the tool she is using, which happens with her and crayons frequently."
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,"this set has every color you need, and a convienent built in sharpener."
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,really just everything you need.
RXM6HSB6V5TFD,i loves these so much that i plan on buying her a second set for christmas.
R1OEG91IYMNIIR,"another great lego ""city"" series product for my grandson."

R1OEG91IYMNIIR,"great quality and usability, result in his parents and myself being completely satisfied with it too."
R6PVV1TU1XK3F,dont buy this.
R6PVV1TU1XK3F,quality is like a dollar store stuff.

R311QM1CSXZ3QC,"they were great at first, but by april, they all had holes and are no longer usable."
R311QM1CSXZ3QC,"three months is not long enough for a positive review.the prosthe colors are vibrant and they are the right size for small children, up to age 6 or 7 maybe."
R1HCS4TZZGBOXP,great doll.
R1HCS4TZZGBOXP,quick service!
R1HCS4TZZGBOXP,lsb
R1CZXKF1CSJG87,i played this with my three year old daughter since she is still learning how to use the controller and it was such great mother daughter bonding time.
R1CZXKF1CSJG87,it kind of felt like we were going to visit princesses at disney and play games with them and dress up like them!
R1CZXKF1CSJG87,"she loved the different games, and that you just answer a few questions and then get to play."
R1CZXKF1CSJG87,we especially loved how you unlock new dresses and accessories and hairstyles and then you can take your picture wearing those.
R1CZXKF1CSJG87,it really made her feel like a princess.
R1CZXKF1CSJG87,"its also nice that some of the games are body interactive, to get your child moving but its also easier for the little ones to do than using the controller but sometimes they motion is a little too sensitive and causes them to get an answer wrong accidentally."
R1CZXKF1CSJG87,there are lots of games within this cartridge and well worth it.
RENUZOEG6OBFE,i loved these.
RENUZOEG6OBFE,soft and cute.
RENUZOEG6OBFE,very good for a photo shoot.

R29C82LX497VYH,i bough this just 2 weeks ago.

R29C82LX497VYH,i am in missouri and she is in texas so this was a birthday present.
R29C82LX497VYH,she is 13 years old so i am quite sure she wasnt being rough with it.
R29C82LX497VYH,anyone else have this problem?
R29C82LX497VYH,i having her send it to me so i can look at it.
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,i have a 6 year old daughter who adores this fairy and would easily give it 5 stars.
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,she loves everything about it.
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,"however, as a parent, i have some concerns."
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,it is a lot of fun once you get her in the air.
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,the base and the feet of the fairy do not fit perfectly together.
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,this makes the fairy fall off the base sometimes before she takes flight.
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,"also, it clearly states in the instructions to keep your hair tied back while using the fairy, make sure you heed that warning."
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,"her wings could easy get tangled in hair when she is flying, and that would not end well for someones hair."
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,"also, if her battery is not completely charged, she will not function properly."
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,"she will fly into walls, people, etc."
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,"my daughter is able to easily manipulate the fairy, but i do not think it would be suitable for a child much under 6. overall, the idea of this toy is awesome, i just think some things could have been done better in order to ensure higher standards of safety."
R1K6RNJMS9U40Z,"thanks to bzzagent, i was able to try this product for free."
R1XO8HO7BDPYA9,better than what our kids had because there is no cord to get tangled.
R1XO8HO7BDPYA9,"otherwise, just as entertaining!!"
R1XO8HO7BDPYA9,!
R1F3KFWAEVPQNC,good
RV8GDY09KQKXX,had to reorder product twice and still isnt wearable.
RV8GDY09KQKXX,so this hat is a totally worthless piece of crap.
RV8GDY09KQKXX,"it came bent, torn, and damaged the first time and even worse shape the second time."
RV8GDY09KQKXX,dont even bother with this hat.
RV8GDY09KQKXX,it does not even look like the hat pictured.
R20TA273EBPBCD,got these for my 3 year olds bubble birthday party.
R20TA273EBPBCD,they were great!
R20TA273EBPBCD,"we used a pump to blow them up, tried blowing one up myself and it was hard work."
R20TA273EBPBCD,took them to the pool and the beach afterwards.
R20TA273EBPBCD,great fun and value for the price.
R2GXJDHMLZYMNI,thanks good quality props i just got them
R2LWX4TZ67FWPT,its a great swing set.
R2LWX4TZ67FWPT,i put it together my self.
R2LWX4TZ67FWPT,it took 6 hours because the directions were not clear and i kept on putting things together backwards.
R2LWX4TZ67FWPT,"however, the directions were not impossible, they were pretty fair."
R2LWX4TZ67FWPT,it does not come with anchors so i anchored it down with cement.
R2LWX4TZ67FWPT,the cement works wonders.
R2LWX4TZ67FWPT,my children are 9 and 11. this set is great for them.
RZ0DAM7UUWUBV,i was very happy with this purchase.
RZ0DAM7UUWUBV,i made the solar powered car in about an hour with very little experience doing this type of thing.
RZ0DAM7UUWUBV,i think older children will really enjoy making the different solar powered objects and learn a lot from completing them.
RZ0DAM7UUWUBV,the product is well made and the picture diagrams are excellent.
RZ0DAM7UUWUBV,"i cant compare this product to others of its type, but i would buy products from this company again."
RU9NVT3JLJCWL,teriffic item i love the smooth operation!
R23KUI2Z93UWL,my great grandchildren loved em.

R1TS8WSPMFMHLK,i would recommend this toy for other 4 year olds!
R1FPR5KBXBIV3R,nice detail but the product cant stand on its own  head is too big for its little legs and the cane does nothing for balance.
R1WJYFHPPCZ4DE,wow!
R1WJYFHPPCZ4DE,this is huge!
R1WJYFHPPCZ4DE,its also great quality which is what you would expect from barbie.
R1WJYFHPPCZ4DE,this is definitely something that will make your little girl go aaaahhhh when she sees it.
R1WJYFHPPCZ4DE,it made me do it.
R1WJYFHPPCZ4DE,"this will give your children lots and lots of fun, but look at the dimensions and make sure you have enough room for them."
R1WJYFHPPCZ4DE,its so pretty and is a great playtime activity and attention keeper for the kids.
R1A83EQ1YQ3HDL,i love this game and love the cards!
R1A83EQ1YQ3HDL,ive been an avid player and collector since the late 90s.
R1A83EQ1YQ3HDL,wish more were available and not so damn expensive.
R1A83EQ1YQ3HDL,hope disney and marvel can somehow breathe some like into these again.
R2RXSS0R8AUR3X,the doll that i received does not look like the doll that was pictured.
R2RXSS0R8AUR3X,it could pass as a villain character.
R3M59MWN21WC5T,we purchased this set for a long car trip activity and it works great!
R3M59MWN21WC5T,there are several scenes to use & lots of magnets.
R3M59MWN21WC5T,one pointer would be to pop out the magnets from the sheet they come in before the trip begins.
R1JBJC4II0BRRF,"just as described, no defects whatsoever!"
R1JBJC4II0BRRF,will buy from you again!
R3R8Y7RXNLWE8I,kids had a great time with these!

R6KNH9BS9GHRH,"no biggie, but it scratches the roof."
R6KNH9BS9GHRH,"2 battery installation is difficult, requiring a screwdriver provided."
R6KNH9BS9GHRH,"understand its needed to keep watertight battery compartment, but i would think a quick latch system would work."
R6KNH9BS9GHRH,3 battery life can be less than desired.
R6KNH9BS9GHRH,quick solution was to purchase additional batteries for hours of fun.
R6KNH9BS9GHRH,"overall  this car is a beast for its price, and my boy is loving every minute of it."

RFL0BSN0O0EW1,i had to exchange this for a bigger size as this costume runs small.
RFL0BSN0O0EW1,the small size  for sizes 46 was too small for my son who is a size 6 so i had to get the medium instead.

R1JQK57F8ZGBCR,"we havent had any problems so far with the ball flying off randomly, which was one of my biggest fears."
R1JQK57F8ZGBCR,there are youtube videos available to show you how to perform some pretty neat tricks.
R1JQK57F8ZGBCR,"i love that its entertaining enough to keep him busy and active, because you have to stand and move around to use it."
R1JQK57F8ZGBCR,interesting little toy.
R1JQK57F8ZGBCR,"i do keep my grandson from swinging in front of tv, windows or any other breakable item, just in case, because this toy is very heavy and solid."

R2CY55GRSVSCB5,this is a very fun and tough strategy game.

RMRYAQR1K7S0Q,"if you are looking for this exact item, do not purchase."
RMRYAQR1K7S0Q,"the package sent to us had similar pieces, but fewer outfits and many more accessories."
RMRYAQR1K7S0Q,we were looking to replace an exact item that had been torn while trying to dress this tiny little rubbery doll in tiny little rubbery clothes exercise in patience to say the least.
RMRYAQR1K7S0Q,"if your child is younger than about five, they will not be able to do this alone."
RMRYAQR1K7S0Q,"i dont review the item very highly in general, but the fact that i received a different item than pictured was why i only gave it a single star."

RFFMWLUVR3ST3,ok so this is plastic spaceship for a toddler.
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,i am not looking for german quality engineering here but this product is ridiculous.
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,"the factory  designer made no effort whatsoever to calibrate their design so it actually works.issues 1, the space helmet has no way staying on the astronaut, the sizing is so off the sits on his head like he just grabbed the closes planter near by and called it a helmet."
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,trying to place the astronaut in the spaceship with the helmet on is impossible.
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,there is not enough clearance to close the cockpit.
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,"so the helmet is useless, it just constantly falls off causing frustration.2, ok issue number one can be explained by, oh son he does not need the helmet in the spaceship ok..... however, the pilot itself it to large for the cockpit."
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,a person really has to finagle and shove the guy in there to fit and for the cockpit to close.
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,"same goes for getting him in and out again this is bs since the fundamental point of the toy.dear toy maker, let me tell you the &34user story&34 for the product."
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,three year old using imagination play with spaceship and astronout having adventures.
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,for this the astronout has to be able to get in and out of his spaceship and travel to other locations and rinse and repeat.
RFFMWLUVR3ST3,what they should not be doing is getting frustrating with trying put together 3 pieces of outerly poorly designed garbage..
R3KXDYFSLWJROU,good

R1BTU7I91DSWCQ,"just like the simon i had back in 1977. fun for all, except the tone deaf, but then they still have the colors to go by."

R3PFANMZFJ5FOO,"works okay, lid is flimsy"
R137KAQCSIDBJF,"honestly, this is a great truck once you put a few new items onto it.... the tires arent great and you should upgrade the springs, those items would make this truck a 4 or 5 star right out of the gate."
R137KAQCSIDBJF,"this fixes are easy and inexpensive, but do a bit of reading online to see what people recommend."
R137KAQCSIDBJF,"once you do them, this truck is awesome, i love mine!"

R20FDDCVF15ZZX,my daughter received this for her 7th bday.
R20FDDCVF15ZZX,she really enjoys sitting down and making these.
R20FDDCVF15ZZX,my only wish is that it came with more beads and that you can only make one design and you will need to buy refills right away.
R20FDDCVF15ZZX,if this is a gift i would buy a pack of refills right away to give with this.
R1UXA23HWHZF09,mythic in every pack....i wish.

RGWQR6ZPK4LLX,"when its fun for an adult, it will be fun for the baby."
RGWQR6ZPK4LLX,"my year old granddaughter loves this, but i agree with other reviewers the plastic top should not come off so easily."
RGWQR6ZPK4LLX,"the switch to change the sounds from piano to silly, sound effects is a great feature."
RGWQR6ZPK4LLX,the main selling point?
RGWQR6ZPK4LLX,she loves this.
R1JV8UI400SIP6,wear on both sides.

R38JG44VWXF5H0,just what i was looking for!
R38JG44VWXF5H0,great colors
R36BS913SLWZQN,this was great i had a surprise birthday party at a bowling ally for my husband.
R36BS913SLWZQN,it was laid back and i brought a cake from the store and just set up the pins and ball on the top of the cake.
R36BS913SLWZQN,looked adorable!.
R36BS913SLWZQN,shipped quickly and came in a polybag.
R2022SS8WZK5MS,speedy delivery.
R2022SS8WZK5MS,i absolutely love this stuffed animal!
R2022SS8WZK5MS,"he makes me smile, hes so soft, and he reminds me of my love for my cat and my love for baking cookies."
R2022SS8WZK5MS,hes very snuggly.
R2022SS8WZK5MS,sometimes i sleep with him when i feel lonely.
R2022SS8WZK5MS,i highly recommend this plush.
R3VDC2U8XK9IH5,"this game is simple, yet really fun to play."
R3VDC2U8XK9IH5,this version doesnt change the game and is completely ridiculous but somehow makes it more fun.
R3VDC2U8XK9IH5,we bought this version and the original so that we can play with more people.
R28OH23OS45DJ7,cute and safe!
R1065ZKZ610V4U,all good
R3MAWWNVHHVVW0,great tool for preschoolers
RMPT75AQDP1HU,"i picked this up for my granddaughter because shes very interested in math and science right now and i want, as much as possible, to encourage her interests, especially when they are educational."
RMPT75AQDP1HU,"as excited as i was to get this for her, i was even more thrilled when i actually got to open the box and flip through the book."
RMPT75AQDP1HU,it isnt very big only 24 pages but theres a lot of information on those few pages!
RMPT75AQDP1HU,"i was tempted to test the kit out on my own smartphone but i refrained, although it wasnt easy, because the book did make me curious about some things.my granddaughter was just as thrilled as i was and started looking through the book and picking which experiments she would do first."
RMPT75AQDP1HU,there wasnt enough time during our visit for me to witness any of these experiments but what grandmother doesnt love seeing her grandchild enthusiastic about learning?
RMPT75AQDP1HU,i love this item and would absolutely consider buying more from smartlab.
RMPT75AQDP1HU,highly recommended.
RDJPJWQ3SQ70K,"item is exactly what it was supposed to be in the description,and it arrived on time."
RDJPJWQ3SQ70K,love it!
R2PD2OJ0QLX96S,items arrived on time.
R2PD2OJ0QLX96S,the work great with my project.
R2PD2OJ0QLX96S,thanks!
R36YS40GE467C2,and it was tons of fun watching my cat when i put this baby out.
R36YS40GE467C2,i moved it around the house so she never knew where it would be.
R36YS40GE467C2,"alas, shes so smart she knows its not a threat now, but ill be putting it out at halloween."
R36YS40GE467C2,good value.
R36YS40GE467C2,would buy more in different poses.
R2WHSUWQQE91YR,not very good.
R2WHSUWQQE91YR,i think you get what you pay for.
R2WHSUWQQE91YR,it is more of a toy.
R3BO1SOPGXSFE3,grwat.
R3BO1SOPGXSFE3,only thing is with a diaper it would be good for a wider butt area to sit on the chair.
RU2D55VLEWJIV,they work great.
R32ZV3J1VL0ZLU,working on this puzzle now and will take forever.
R32ZV3J1VL0ZLU,the pieces are cut so similar and are so small.
R32ZV3J1VL0ZLU,it would have been better to make this a 750 piece puzzle and make the pieces somewhat different.
R32ZV3J1VL0ZLU,i am piecing by color and subject which is hard because there is so many subjects in this puzzle.
R32ZV3J1VL0ZLU,also the pieces do not stick together so hard to manage.
R32ZV3J1VL0ZLU,"i was expecting the same quality as before on sunsout puzzles, but this one fails."
R3J5Z24CGLG8DG,"looking forward to christmas, my 2 yr. old grandson loves to knock things down!"
R1ZPQIBDMK4LAG,fun for the kids to play with but i wish the track was longer.
R24GGJYRZCXNKQ,as advertised
R3CQPGFIOWQLNS,"despite the character being one of my favorites to be available as a pop figure, this one leaves a bit to be desired."
R3CQPGFIOWQLNS,the stand to hold her in upright since her body is tiny compared to the normally stocky male figures does not work particularly well and so she stands at an angle no matter how the base is shifted.
R3CQPGFIOWQLNS,buffy does look cute with the rest of her friends and enemies she just needs to lean against something to stay completely upright.
R1JYONVNBU0EY0,arrived on time and was exactly as expected
RAX8RN4DB7CR1,"eh  iz ok. the size is nice, but it is made of felt and looks a bit childish."
RAX8RN4DB7CR1,"i suppose hp is childish though, isnt it?"
RAX8RN4DB7CR1,dont judge me.
R1WWEZK9W15V2P,enjoyed the game  took a few times to get strategy
R163MWYMZN6OXH,my grandson is using it as we speak.
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,i love this outfit for the 18&34 doll!
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,it is soooo cute!
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,my granddaughter is going to go crazy over this!
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,she is 8yrs old and in allstar cheerleader so i can just see her putting this on her doll and taking her to competition with her!
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,i checked all over every piece of this outfit.
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,everything was perfect!
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,all seams looked good.
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,no scratchy thread ends.
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,"they do use velcro as the closure on the shirt part, but it is the softer velcro.the skirt has elastic so it is easy to put on."
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,the pompoms have elastic so you can put them on the hands or wrists.
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,"you can also use them on the dolls hair, so adorable!"
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,the socks and shoes are also easy to put on!
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,i have an 18&34 doll for trying these outfits on and for when i am making outfits myself!
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,the pictures are of my test doll with the outfit on.
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,"as you will see, the outfit is just absolutely adorable!"
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,i love the outfits from this company!
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,so much care is taken when they are sewn together and then packaged!
RY3WLWJC7CHHY,i will continue buying doll outfits from ride along dolly!this makes an awesome gift for any child for the 18&34 dolls!disclaimer this item was purchased at a discounted price for reviewing purposes!
R1NORVP2MXMIMW,loved itthanks
R1BWI3WQZOA0XJ,my grandson loved it.
R1BWI3WQZOA0XJ,little big for him but we adjusted it to fit his head.
RMWDWEJZXNYEN,my nephew loved it!
R21XOI5U5NUOOI,brand new in package be very nice as gift
R3I166B12P1OR9,love the game!i hit home runs and now all my friends are getting it
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,"our family consists for a 2 year and 1 year, primary users, and 14 year old who occasionally jumps in."
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,even my 10 year old niece enjoys jumping in it.
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,its a great backyard size.
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,i was a little concerned at first because it does say not to use with an extension cord and our outdoor outlets are too far away from any flat spot for bouncing.
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,we have used it with this heavy duty extension cord a number of times with no troubles.
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,the castle is easy to set up and is ready to go within a few minutes of pulling it out of the carrying bag.
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,we place a tarp or outdoor blanket under it to help keep it clean and protect from any missed sharp objects.
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,take down is a little more work and requires a little more time but i am able to do it in under 20 minutes.
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,the hard part is that its heavy and takes a little time to roll up well so that it fits nice in the carrying bag.
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,my kids will play in it for hours.
R22Y2TG2U03TPN,thrilled to be able to add this to our backyard toys.
R3MGVYO36L8VV2,"as a huge fan of the harvest moon series, i have collected all of the preorder plush and premium plush toys that natsume has put out."
R3MGVYO36L8VV2,"that said, i was very excited for the new beginning premium sheep."
R3MGVYO36L8VV2,"it makes a great addition to my collection, but i must admit i was a little disappointed...it is not quite as nice as the others from the premium series.first, this plush is unstable."
R3MGVYO36L8VV2,it has tiny feet with no wires or anything to keep it upright.
R3MGVYO36L8VV2,"it is extremely topheavy and will fall over or forward unless you put something underneath its belly for support.secondly, the fleece material is not as soft as ive seen on other toys."
R3MGVYO36L8VV2,"its not quite as soft and cuddly as id hoped.one more thing of note, the description states that this is the sheep from a new beginning."
R3MGVYO36L8VV2,"this is definately based off of the sheep from the lost valley.to wrap it up, i do like this plush, but i would only recommend it to collectors."
R3MGVYO36L8VV2,"its not easy to display, and it is not really soft enough to cuddle in bed."
R3URN1XPIVT9AV,thought it was a bigger toy!
R3URN1XPIVT9AV,it was a little smaller then what i expected or wanted.
R8KJH7OEZWVYQ,super fun!
R21TPVDP7F9PXH,great pencils
RWRMCST02740H,"great product, assembly is a pain but you cant beat the price."
RWRMCST02740H,my stepdaughter absolutely loved the wardrobe.
RWRMCST02740H,very cute.
R3E6IBVFS18HLV,"smartest toy purchase ive ever made for my then 2 yearold, now almost 5 yearold granddaughter."
R3E6IBVFS18HLV,"shes still loving it, more than the more sophisticated and elaborate doll house at her home, and her 1 yearold brother is crazy about it too."
R3E6IBVFS18HLV,"if a boy playing with anything with pink on it isnt anathema, its just as good a gift for him as for a little girl."
R1IYIKNML4P1DB,horns do not come with stick application and blindfold fell apart
RV8MT6PN6D0EY,"wonderfull doll for a girl, its too similar to the original chapter in the movie."
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,"i looked at a lot of reviews on these tubes, mostly positive and some negative."
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,"decided to make the purchase, with no regrets."
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,i took the advice to blow them up at home to check for any defects.
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,they all inflated and held air and looked great.
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,we enjoyed a 3 hour float on the boise idaho river without incident.
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,at one point we had 3 of them connected with the rope and quick connect provided.
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,"we were pulled into a 20"" diameter tree stump sticking 18"" out of the water."
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,"my daughter was flipped over the stump and into the river, and all the tubes stayed together with no casualties with the exception of my shocked daughter lol."
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,no problems with the mesh bottom ripping out as noted by others.
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,so far so good!
R1Z9OTDMNJDH7A,recommended!
R1050IFP1WBSX1,perfect for my daughter in laws baby shower used it to hold candy for a guessing game.
R1I3DOORMNGMNI,"the lightning mcqueen theme is nice and ultimately why we got this, but the quad is lacking in a few areas, which are able to be fixed if youre handymotivated enough."
R1I3DOORMNGMNI,"turn radius this was pretty poor, it couldnt make the turn from driveway to sidewalk for my son."
R1I3DOORMNGMNI,to fix this you need to disconnect the steering column and remove the columnhandlebars then trim the notches in the hole to allow more turning.
R1I3DOORMNGMNI,range you can fit a second 6v 4.5ah battery under the seat quite easily.
R1I3DOORMNGMNI,you can hook it up in parallel for added run time or just leave it there so you can swap batteries if youre out on a walk and he runs out of juice might need to carry a screwdriver to remove the seat then rough terrain barely moves through a yard and constantly gets stuck when the single drive wheel lifts off the ground.
R1I3DOORMNGMNI,"to fix this i acquired a second motor from a craigslist quad and put it in, goes like a champ now!no reverse this can also be modded in utilizing an spdt switch.overall, not the best platform, but not the worst."
R1I3DOORMNGMNI,shortcomings can be fixed if youre okay modifying the toy.
R1I3DOORMNGMNI,"the size is very nice for the 13yo group, though the younger kids tend to have a little trouble with the finger &34go&34 button."
R1I3DOORMNGMNI,if you plan on using this in a yard and dont want to bother with converting it to 2wd yourself i recommend you stay away from this one and find a model that drives both rear wheels.
RVUBQABFUWBL0,i bought a set for all of my grandkids for the 4th of july to use when the sparklers ran out.
RVUBQABFUWBL0,they had an awesome time out in the dark yard till one of the kids got hit in the eye.
RVUBQABFUWBL0,not any fault of the product.
RVUBQABFUWBL0,only one of them has had a problem.
RVUBQABFUWBL0,it still lights but there is no sound.
R3NOSJZ7SZRHK7,it became dirty
R11NV94MCELWPY,my friends kid is really happy playing with this toy!
R11NV94MCELWPY,!im glad that i got this for him!thank you.
R2PX2GW93QIRNX,super cute little zebra that was purchased as a replacement for a previous animal my daughter lost.
R2PX2GW93QIRNX,its really cuddly and just right for a small child.
R7BHKQI1DNM7M,great keepsakes from a movie classic
R2SIREPYWPWD3S,perfect.
R3DXM9NA7KK16S,"we love this game, its great for get togethers with friends or the right mix of family who can handle the subject matter!"
RRGI3AAL51J3T,the game lacks balance.
RRGI3AAL51J3T,"it is a neat idea, but we played through a few games and they are either very fast or drag on and on."
RRGI3AAL51J3T,not impressed and glad i didnt buy the expansions.
R1JC00ACQCEKMC,love these little magnets.
R1JC00ACQCEKMC,you never have to worry about the magnetic strip falling off because its just part of the letter.
R1JC00ACQCEKMC,my boys 2 and 4 absolutely love playing with these magnets.
R1JC00ACQCEKMC,plus we love most things disney.
R3IUU95KUH794A,"my boys like it, however the loadingunloading clip mechanism is a bit tricky, definitely not for rough use."
RCL2Y08WSA76D,these bags worked great for a recent party.
RCL2Y08WSA76D,"bubbles, toys, and other items fit great with room to spare."
RCL2Y08WSA76D,"the bags are small, but held what we needed them to."
R274OFTP5GUFBP,cute to look at but the food slips right off.
R274OFTP5GUFBP,... the ends are too narrow.
R274OFTP5GUFBP,"makes it great for stabbing the food, but not picking it up"
R849832IBOT1L,"not much to say, this cube is amazing and is my main and probaly will be my main for a while"
R37LG79G4F9QZR,nephew loved it!
R21E1CLSU8PUVE,great quality and our little boy loves.
R21E1CLSU8PUVE,material is extremely durable.
R21E1CLSU8PUVE,our 75 lb lab has accidentally made it in there a couple times and i was afraid her nails might have made a whole or messed it up but it has held up fantastic!
R1UK7DGWJG7021,kids love it
R1YVTWX8SI4EKC,as a soap bubble performer i like to display a variety of colorful bubble blowers in different shapes and sizes on my handcrafted bubble wands.
R1YVTWX8SI4EKC,this package did the job.
R1YVTWX8SI4EKC,the wands are strong and bright.
R1YVTWX8SI4EKC,the variety endless.
R1YVTWX8SI4EKC,i am pleased.
R3C6UT59EK377J,these feel like solid rock.
R3C6UT59EK377J,"i know they are to look at, but i didnt like that"
R2C80SB7AYM5PW,bought it for two of my nieces celebrating oneyear birthdays and both kids immediately climbed on!
RP5BJ5EO39DTZ,"my son loves to build legos, etc and loves mario, but was not very into this knex system at all."

R31FM0T5RDTHBE,legos  fun fun fun
RFV7WYMUKFDC,chintzy.
R1RAMLAYJ7VWSR,i got these shoes for my daughters dolls.
R1RAMLAYJ7VWSR,she doesnt have any issues with getting them on or off by herself.
R1RAMLAYJ7VWSR,therefore they are a great fit.
R1RAMLAYJ7VWSR,hope your little girl likes them as my little girl does.
R23FMCPGYYG352,"great learning toy, and soft and fun as well, its awesome how a little fun toy with bright colors can help a toddler learn at such a fast pace."
R23FMCPGYYG352,love this toy.
R23FMCPGYYG352,will be ordering another soon.
RM2F3HMFCED4T,"although i had some initial doubts as to build quality and durability, my daughter has had a blast with this toy bow."
RM2F3HMFCED4T,"its listed as ages 8 and up mostly for legal reasons, im sure, though kids younger than that will be able to handle it."
RM2F3HMFCED4T,"the unit may mimic a compound bow, but it isnt one, so the draw strength is quite low, and even the little ones will be able to draw it and fire an arrow."
RM2F3HMFCED4T,"the arrows are tipped with soft, collapsible rubber, so they are quite safe they also whistle as they fly."
RM2F3HMFCED4T,"the limitations on string draw and arrow weighttip means that these wont fly super high or far, but just right for little kids to play and practice their shooting."
RM2F3HMFCED4T,"im also happy to see a product aimed for girls that isnt a doll or some other stereotypical ""girly"" toy!"
RTXAXQ67D5EFV,teaching the kids how to play with this set and they love it.
R22X7C65OFI0ZH,my son is really into buzz light year and has the $25 toy.
R22X7C65OFI0ZH,my mom purchased this deluxe buzz for a special birthday present.
R22X7C65OFI0ZH,we have been less than thrilled.
R22X7C65OFI0ZH,"we were initially drawn to the product bc of the flyinglanding sound it supposedly makes when he is horizontal, but that only happens during one of the phrases when u press his button continuously."
R22X7C65OFI0ZH,the arm band initially made buzz react when u opened it but it stopped working after a few tries.
R22X7C65OFI0ZH,the helmet doesnt make any noise either.
R22X7C65OFI0ZH,"also, there are not 60 phrases."
R22X7C65OFI0ZH,"basically, the only difference between this buzz and the $25 buzz is this buzz head moves side to side and he has a rubber center belt."
R22X7C65OFI0ZH,not worth the extra $50!
R18W7BPI7UA616,my son was very happy!
R3HLAH1C2WO332,very good
R3LY4WN10SXCFQ,bought this for my daughter.

R15L4AW3TKVCT7,pusheen is awesome!
R15L4AW3TKVCT7,"and i love to bake, so this notebook is perfect for me."
R2VYOCFZDNPX4G,"there appear to be some duplicate cards in the package which is a little less fun, but it does state that the mix is random, so i cant say i didnt consider it a possibility"
R39JUPCQAZ2TGN,will be a great game for the smaller children like toddlers that cant throw very far and this will be laying on the ground for them to pay.
R1B2GH6OXMQUPF,the kids love them
R3S18IXR5706H4,just as pictured and sturdy

RCB9KTYD8G26Z,we recieved the toy from bzzagent for review.
RCB9KTYD8G26Z,the helicopter travels to impressive heights and the boys have played with it daily.
R2VCB5X8HL61BC,"the kids loved these, but they do have a strong ""aroma""."
R2VCB5X8HL61BC,i soaked them in water and left them outside for a while and it helped a bit.
R2VCB5X8HL61BC,"once the kids won some, and they were not all in one place they were fine."
R2VCB5X8HL61BC,its just having 144 all confined that they kind of stink!

R3C3NUDURMKVCD,excelent the best for the trainer plane
R3JMOS3DVY5NKJ,verry good
R38I6ZSRIRIS0T,i love this game!
R38I6ZSRIRIS0T,it helps me learn new words.
R38I6ZSRIRIS0T,"the tile lock prevents the letters from moving, but i dont think you would be able to play well if youre in a moving vehicle."
R1B6PMU8OC9H00,bought it for my boyfriend.
R1B6PMU8OC9H00,he loves it.
R1B6PMU8OC9H00,he played pranks on everyone since he has gotten it
R7NXE1KWTSKY1,great product  a lot of filler in the form of fake food boxes but whatever.
R7NXE1KWTSKY1,it wasnt terrible for the price.
RJNWULYCJ5ZFA,"good packaging, bright bold colors and sharpened."
RJNWULYCJ5ZFA,color well and dont break easily comes off with soap and water or on clothing when washed in washer.
RJNWULYCJ5ZFA,comfortable length and width for children and adults.
RA5IGC1N4IVQ3,my son loves this and its easy to play for a 4 year old and there are parts that use the webcam where he jumps around grabbing coins great for an active kid!
R5O1DUSN0I3SB,my granddaughter loves paw patrol...
R2WMBIW6KKSCW2,"pretty small beach balls, but very adorable for small kids or bath tubs or floating down a creek for some child to find."
R3KQ1BAY4OWKG2,all feathers falling out everywhere
R2E3QC7YHUDSMX,great quality.
R2ZYLHGGBMO2D9,great toy.

R2YJOKZYDR789Z,this is quality wooden product.
R2YJOKZYDR789Z,my 2 years old love playing with them.
R2YJOKZYDR789Z,"at this stage, she likes to sort all the same color or same shape."
R2YJOKZYDR789Z,really recommend.
R3LK7R82WU41IT,half of them the lids were already off so i had to put a little tape on them and frankly they only shoot about 18 would not recommend these to anyone
R3B6I13WCVY35A,this was purchased for review.
R3B6I13WCVY35A,this was used for my daughters 7th birthday party.
R3B6I13WCVY35A,we set up a background out side and let the kids have at it!
R3B6I13WCVY35A,they were easy to put together and took very little time to do so.
R3B6I13WCVY35A,the kids had a blast and will be able to use them again for other occasions.
R3B6I13WCVY35A,i would recommend giving a few extra stickies in case one gets messed up or for the bigger cutouts.
R2EFHJ8MKL5RFS,we like melissa and doug toys for the kids because they all seem to last and have some educational element.
R2EFHJ8MKL5RFS,these sticker pads are no exception  i like them most because they encourage the little ones to create narratives and stories.
R1QOTI5GCXSA5L,"as an avid diyer and tool user, i was a little fascinated by this toolbox."
R1QOTI5GCXSA5L,weve owned several sets of kids play tools and so many of them are just for looks and dont actually do anything.
R1QOTI5GCXSA5L,this one does!
R1QOTI5GCXSA5L,and it doesnt have forty billion pieces that get lost all over the house.
R1QOTI5GCXSA5L,"i love that the screwdriver, which color matches the screws to lessen confusion actually screws them in and out."
R1QOTI5GCXSA5L,same for the wrench.
R1QOTI5GCXSA5L,the saw doesnt do much but i dont actually want my kid sawing things lol.
R1QOTI5GCXSA5L,the toolbox comes apart and scout encourages them to put it back together as well as do some other activities.
R1QOTI5GCXSA5L,its really an awesome tool box toy.
R1S313WI5BTPYY,always great
R8E1COC4JXFSN,an interesting and diabolical take on the old chutes and ladders game of your childhood!
R8E1COC4JXFSN,no more mr. niceguy!
R8E1COC4JXFSN,aim for other players on the gameboard in an attempt to blow off an arm or leg or even the head!
R8E1COC4JXFSN,make cookies using gingerbread cutouts and its even more fun.
R8E1COC4JXFSN,can be played with two or more players.
R8E1COC4JXFSN,rules are easy to learn.
R9HRFYKRCFNUZ,excellent.... fast shipment.

R3A1GAD565YXVO,bought this for my 2.5 year old.
R3A1GAD565YXVO,she loves it.
R3A1GAD565YXVO,the dresses are easy enough for her to take off and put on by herself.
R3A1GAD565YXVO,they also fit the other magiclip dolls so she has a blast swapping dresses with other princesses.
R3A1GAD565YXVO,the 2 dresses that came with the rapunzel doll have come apart several times.
R3A1GAD565YXVO,they snap back together easily but this hasnt happened with any of our other dresses.
R6D8ASD7LX360,missing a hubcap wheel keeps falling off
R3HLP151W1Q9T1,adorable and sweet!
R2UNH1IHA7QUJ1,we have all of these landmark molds by hape and my son enjoys them very much.
R2UNH1IHA7QUJ1,every time we bring them to the beach we always have a group of children gathering to play and a lot of parents ask is about them.
R2UNH1IHA7QUJ1,"they are colorful, wellmade and unique."
R2UNH1IHA7QUJ1,they took a beating at the beach all summer and still look great.
R2UNH1IHA7QUJ1,"there are additional pieces sold on amazon including the sydney opera house, the leaning tower of pisa and the eiffel tower."
R2UNH1IHA7QUJ1,i hope they continue to make more.
R2UNH1IHA7QUJ1,well buy them all.
R1YVA03X9QWXKK,"even though this is an older design, the darts work extremely well with the asinb00jutyj68 nerf nstrike elite rough cut 2x4 blaster."
R1YVA03X9QWXKK,the topheavy darts actually fly further than the elite darts.
RAIXX1YKA4SKM,this thing is freaking sweet.
RAIXX1YKA4SKM,"i have to keep it in my closet though because my wife is afraid itll scare the kids, haha!"
RVXCX0CYLJXOL,"so seeing these little guys are meant for a larger maze like set, this specific cage set should be priced a little lower currently at $19."
RVXCX0CYLJXOL,"anyhoo, they are cute whether in the spinning wheel cage here or cruising around the floor."
RVXCX0CYLJXOL,good news the 3 watch batteries it uses are included.i know i will be stepping in this little guy soon.
R3N09DAQ2ZT6OI,there was a rip in it and it was not what it looked like in the picture.
RR4VMWURL9ZUR,"when i first saw the poster design based on the old world war ii rosie the riveter, i really loved the idea."
RR4VMWURL9ZUR,"when i saw that there was a statue based on that poster, i knew i had to have it."
RR4VMWURL9ZUR,"excellent craftsmanship, and the pricing was quite reasonable."
R35HF9XI30EEO5,poor workmanship!!!
R35HF9XI30EEO5,just have to return it.
R2LIKOX8BEUR8Q,definitely funnoo!
R2LIKOX8BEUR8Q,!
R14HBC7AM0BUBD,girls loved it price very reasonable
R3QY12M08A1AW0,good
R1ZP0ITRFXYHON,bought for my then 8 year old.
R1ZP0ITRFXYHON,big hit.
R1ZP0ITRFXYHON,we all play on family game nights.
R1ZP0ITRFXYHON,helps broaden his vocabulary and spelling.
R1ZP0ITRFXYHON,"much like scrabble, but more kid friendly."
R2X0MMCU7LTWBA,"this wand is very colorful, sparkly, and sturdy."
R2X0MMCU7LTWBA,my daughter did snap one in half but i think she had to work at it to do it.
R2X0MMCU7LTWBA,luckily i had a spare one just for this reason.
R2X0MMCU7LTWBA,she loves this wand.
R3SU9VIH2EPR1B,the swing doesnt sit straight.
R3SU9VIH2EPR1B,it tilts more forward.
R3SU9VIH2EPR1B,the guard for protection doesnt go up far enough to get into the swing.
R3SU9VIH2EPR1B,finally the lock on the guard is hard to open after it has been locked in place.
R3TZHJ3BVYO1N9,excellent product that intrigues children.
R3CT0EO2N5V3BW,super cute and good quality
R2CFDOYV2FB4QQ,i bought these for my 4 year old nephews birthday.
R2CFDOYV2FB4QQ,he really enjoyed playing with these.
R2CFDOYV2FB4QQ,it took him a little while to understand the mechanics of how they go together.
R2CFDOYV2FB4QQ,once he got the hang of it there were no limits as to what he could build.
R8X4CJT9Y7RYL,used so long my daughter eventually gave it to my son!
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,ive had this model kit on my wish list for several months.
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,"when i initially added it, it was around $75, and i would check back every few days to see if the price dropped."
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,"for some reason, the newer amt round 2 model of this kit isnt available at all anywhere that i could find."
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,"last week, when i saw it was down to $24.99, i knew i couldnt pass that up."
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,"package arrived mintinbox, and, even though one corner was a little crumpled, everything inside was still wrapped and in new condition."
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,i was extremely pleased with how well the pieces of this kit went together.
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,"with the other kits from 20 years ago, id always had trouble with some pieces not fitting correctly due to age andor warping."
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,but i got lucky with this one.
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,everything fit and glued together just like it was supposed to.
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,"and, as usual, i went with my own color scheme."
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,"it looks great sitting on my shelf next to the battlecruiser from star trek vi.updatei purchased a second kit, and i decided to try a different color scheme."
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,"plus, i think i like the attack mode wing configuration better than the flight mode."
R2M8Z9VC3ZEC2L,"although im still not sure i chose the right shade of green for the ships hull, i definitely like the second color scheme better than the first."
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,"there are a number of things that i like about this game, although it is intended for a much younger audience."
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,"before talking about what i like, i will explain those points that i found either not good, or not so nice.i searched all over for instructions but those that are provided with the merchandise, and those offered at the amazon product page are minimal."
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,i can understand that providing written instructions is a cost they want to avoid.
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,"but, remembering that this is targeted for kids, who are likely to seek or need parental help, written instructions would be preferred.still, since the app is an integral part of the game, possibly, having a video demo would be a good way to go."
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,only by scrolling through the rules and instructions was i able to learn that i must wage a bet on the letter desigbating my selection.
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,"until i chanced upon the instructions at the opening screen, i was on the edge of quitting and writing a harsh review.why harsh?"
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,"because i had already been forced to reboot my mini ipad, since it crashed three times while starting the app."
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,"the reboot took care of that, but then i was stumbling through the game unable to cast a choice because i hadnt wagered anything and didnt know how to confirm my wager and choice.still, once i did get everything going, i found this to be a terrific game for kids, say, from 8 to 16 years of age."
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,"mind you, it will not likely take the world by storm the way trivial pursuit did during the eighties, but it will be a game that many kids will enjoy.i also can see how such a hybrid gameapp could be used in other endeavors."
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,education is one.
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,"for instance, a kid could read a book that is linked to youtube videos, then take a quiz that tests them on what theyve learned.another feature i enjoyed was the selfie, modified for comic effect."
R2NMZC8QAIUC1Y,"i also like how the app can see the board positioning.overall, i found the game is suitable for youth whose parents are looking for fun, wholesome entertainment.cautionary note there are board pieces that could pose a choking hazard for children under three years of age.parents are looking for fun, wholesome entertainment.cautionary note there are board pieces that could pose a choking hazard for children under three years of age."
R2B4UMGVFYED9P,this wig fits my 10 year olds head.
R2B4UMGVFYED9P,it is advertised as adult but its really not.
R2B4UMGVFYED9P,however we saw the reviews and purchased because it was for my daughter
R1HCYOP8S0J6Q6,"was perfect gift for my grandson,exactly like picture, arrived fast"
R2XSFTUMSXH3J1,my ten year old daughter loves these.
R2XSFTUMSXH3J1,when you step down the ears pop up.
R2XSFTUMSXH3J1,they seem fairly well made.
R2XSFTUMSXH3J1,a large size is a bit snug on my daughter who wears size 23 shoes.
R2XSFTUMSXH3J1,they look exactly as pictured and arrived quickly.
R189T8TJANW3IT,awesome.
R189T8TJANW3IT,the details are amazing.
R24S7DM88AXMBH,once again i have not paid attention to the dimensions and its smaller than i expected.
R2EJRZYGCHOYE1,ostrich was a big hit for one excited little boy.
R2EJRZYGCHOYE1,he absolutely loved this little animal.
R2EJRZYGCHOYE1,he had an experience with a live one at a petting zoo and this was his birthday wish was an ostrich for his birthday.
R2EJRZYGCHOYE1,he carried it around all afternoon.
R346VO10MO8V1D,"bought 2 of these, expecting them to be pretty cheap."
R346VO10MO8V1D,"they were surprisingly resistant to impact, except the propellers."
R346VO10MO8V1D,"it comes with several spare propellers, but that was still ultimately was what limited their lifespan."
R346VO10MO8V1D,"i imagine mine still work, but without the proper number of propellers, theyre packed up.one of the two was easier to set up and get going."
R346VO10MO8V1D,"i am complete novice to drones, absolute first time."
R346VO10MO8V1D,i was able to make sense of the controls for these cheapies before the propellers were all broken did i mention the propellers yet?.
R346VO10MO8V1D,buying a larger drone now to see if i learned anything.
R3VXPMROD2ZYTE,"great, here right away."
RXHRR961TDG1W,"other than a mix up in shipping, which was handled promptly."
RXHRR961TDG1W,the magnet is great.
RXHRR961TDG1W,great quality.
RXJ9HB5E7KITO,the look of this easel is nice and the functionality is nice as well.
RXJ9HB5E7KITO,the quality did not live up to my expectations.
RXJ9HB5E7KITO,the chalk side is poor quality.
RXJ9HB5E7KITO,the chalk cannot be erased completely leaving ghost image behind plus the green paint seemed to be chipped off on a small spot after 2 weeks of using.my son still likes it 3yrs old and uses it every day.
RXJ9HB5E7KITO,the good news is the chalk board seems to be detachable and we are hoping to be able to order that part separately when completely ruined.
RXJ9HB5E7KITO,fyi  we use the regular nontoxic chalk designed for chalk boards.
R3R3Z6EUMCI2LG,great
RX7ZB6BO7W9Z9,this toy is horrible.
RX7ZB6BO7W9Z9,i bought it for my 4 yr old to play with and he got so frustrated when the legs fell off.
RX7ZB6BO7W9Z9,"we would no sooner get one leg on and another, or two, would fall off."
RX7ZB6BO7W9Z9,"the ant is very cool and now that the legs, head and wings are super glued together.i did get to glue it so that only the legs and abdomen touch the ground."
RX7ZB6BO7W9Z9,such a waste for a really cool toy.
R3M6FDMICTHZ7Z,instructions on how to play are not very clear.
R3M6FDMICTHZ7Z,there is still some confusion when playing and we have to continually reshuffle the deck and it says in the instructions that the game was designed to not have to reshuffle the deck.
R3M6FDMICTHZ7Z,"obviously we are not playing the game correctly, but the instructions lack details to help us play the way the game was meant to be played."
R1476M6QVTD2D5,again it took so long to receive them.
R1476M6QVTD2D5,this lot was much bigger than the last
R35FZPK3DYA050,my review is similar to one of the others  the dragon itself is really cool and looks as expected.
R35FZPK3DYA050,"however, the tail is wrong  its long and basically straight, so when the dragon is placed on the pedestal, the tail goes beneath it and the entire thing wobbles off to the side.since im putting mine on a high shelf, i cut up the clear plastic carton it came with and gave it a second stand so the tail could hang off."
R35FZPK3DYA050,"another reviewer placed it on the end of a shelf or something so the tail hung off.otherwise, its what i wanted."
R35FZPK3DYA050,but the wrong tail is a big issue
R1V8PLP298L1JJ,ok
R26SZJNLIPFRNM,perfect replacement for my u818 quadcopter
R2KDYL1G2YL88F,only received one finger hand.
R2KDYL1G2YL88F,i want a refund or the other 4.
RVVYTAKIVLKOS,"good product, priced about right."
RVVYTAKIVLKOS,the lamp can change colours and flash with the beats.
RVVYTAKIVLKOS,"its pretty damn retro cool.seller was great, sent promptly and well packaged."
RVVYTAKIVLKOS,he actually followed up with the shipping too.good experience all round.recommended.
RZHHWH1U4QBWG,this were complete garbage.
RZHHWH1U4QBWG,completely fell apart as i was taking them out of the package.
RZHHWH1U4QBWG,dont waste your time or money on these.
R2OAQNW1DU01DD,his name is maruko.
R2OAQNW1DU01DD,hes a boss.hes pretty well built and about 20&34 stem to stern.
RBM8GAZUOH2X6,my granddaughter loves it!!
RBM8GAZUOH2X6,!
R1W1XET78IH8K1,great quality and the kids love it!
R30TVLWSQU1PTB,"my only irritation is that his helmet does not stay on very well at all, and it caused me some issues getting him to stay on the base."
R30TVLWSQU1PTB,"otherwise he is beautifully detailed, the expressions true to form for the one eyed dragon, and all the pieces fit very well."
R30TVLWSQU1PTB,he was well worth the price.
RUZ4LM7XZC5UA,my granddaughter loves it.
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"truly sad ""im sadness."""
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"yes, you truly are."
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"after hearing what this tiny doll has to say, i was feeling pretty sad myself."
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,its not just the all over blue.
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"when sadness speaks, she kind of slumps to the side in an all around sad and pathetic."
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"""we shouldnt go in there."
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,thats a bad idea.
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"""""find the fun."
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,i dont know how to do that.
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"""""i dont think that will work."
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"""""im sad."
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"""""goodbye friendship."
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,hello loneliness.
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,"""the inside out dolls are much better than stuffed toys."
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,these are toys that are about emotion.
RNO9QVKZ7AFHU,that makes them worth their weight in gold.
RMBQPJ4G9DVXK,got this for my grandsons and they both 3 and 5 play with it constantly.i think it was great!
RE0ICJTTZOG19,arrived pretty fast the head band and necklace fit good but the ring is huge on me then again i have small fingers

R1UWD0NQYM8CIS,this is a perfect gift for a child.
R1UWD0NQYM8CIS,my sisters granddaughter loved it.
R1UWD0NQYM8CIS,the voice is so pleasing and the final statement is perfect to use as a nighttime tool for getting a child to sleep.
R1UWD0NQYM8CIS,the movement gets the childs attention.
R1UWD0NQYM8CIS,it arrived when expected.
R1UWD0NQYM8CIS,i am very pleased with the product and the time it took to receive the package.
R1L36MRQAFELTO,"love this game, have to say i liked king of tokyo a lot more.the new rules added to this game, i personally do not think are as fun.overall though, love this game very reasonable price."
R2RIY02E18CBF8,my grandson loves it!
R2RIY02E18CBF8,not easy to assemble !!
R2RIY02E18CBF8,"!,"
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,videoidc4451a28e986a6c33791ff33bfce2187our five year old son is a lover of rubber duckies!!
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,"when i saw these little cuties, i knew they would be a perfect addition to his other ducks."
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,"they came all packaged together in one bag, inside a box."
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,they are the perfect size for little hands.
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,they also float!
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,"there is a hole at the bottom and if you squeeze them out of water, they squeak."
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,"you can also fill them with water and squirt people, which my son loves to do!!"
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,he thinks its hilarious to spray mommy!!
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,they come in a pack of 18 and have the cutest faces.
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,my little guy loved having these in the bath with him.
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,"these awesome rubber ducks have so many uses...i think they would be adorable to use as decorations for a baby shower, or even in treat bags for kids birthday parties."
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,"i received these cute little guys for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion."
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,all pictures and videos are my own.
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,opinions are mine and my sons.
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,we love these ducks!
R1XBJR0HNF85P8,i would recommend them to everyone.
RLV3O1YWZ1OQR,"high quality and my daughter thinks she is a princess when she has her ""high heels"" on."
RLV3O1YWZ1OQR,these are great shoes for a child who no longer fits into the smaller princess dress up shoes.
R2CP9YM9DYPYIM,"great bike, i didnt buy it in amazon but from the manufacturers website.im glad i went with this model, i little more expensive but real pneumatic all terrain tires and a hand break.i bought the lowering kit to help my kid feel safer with both feet flat in the ground.very solid bike yet very light, my 2.5 y.o."
R2CP9YM9DYPYIM,"kid can pick it up and move it around.it takes a couple of weeks for kids to get used to two tires, but once they find the balance point they progress very quickly."
R2CP9YM9DYPYIM,my kid went from not being able to stand and move the bike alone to race me running behind and in about 2 months.my kid already knows how to use the brake and im sure the transition to a pedal bike will be smooth.
R2WYNQM4VQA0E0,too messy.
R1NRWCHYHKRCGN,i bought these for my daughter.
R1NRWCHYHKRCGN,she loves shopkins.
R1NRWCHYHKRCGN,this was her first season 3 set.
R1NRWCHYHKRCGN,she loves them!
R1NRWCHYHKRCGN,theyre tiny little pieces of rubber that are a good quality.
R1NRWCHYHKRCGN,"i would not recommend these for little kids, as they are pretty small."
R1NRWCHYHKRCGN,these are great for a little older girls to collect and play.
R1NRWCHYHKRCGN,my daughters 8 and loves collecting them.
R1L2EN7RUIIPPO,worked perfectly!
R376I010EXXTAR,its wonderfull
RGKOLTS6V5MUL,this is such a fun game for any princess fan and perfect for the younger leaptv users.
RGKOLTS6V5MUL,my four year old enjoys playing this game but in my opinion one as young as three could easily enjoy it.
RGKOLTS6V5MUL,"this game covers a variety of reading such as phonics, the alphabet, sight words and spelling."
R728AJC9KXJLD,m&d toys are terrific.
R728AJC9KXJLD,i love the wood construction.
R728AJC9KXJLD,the only caveat i have about these is the sorting cube.
R728AJC9KXJLD,"the cube itself has a removable side for taking the shapes back out or for storage, but it is noticeably thinner wood than the other sides of the cube."
R728AJC9KXJLD,i fear that this piece will eventually be broken.
R728AJC9KXJLD,"otherwise these toys are solid, safe, and will provide a lot of fun for my little one."
R1ULJ1CD8EOJ9R,this certainly is fun toy for kids.
R1ULJ1CD8EOJ9R,i ordered this for my 2 year old but my 5 year old is also enjoying this a lot.
R1ULJ1CD8EOJ9R,initially i had doubt whether this will last few hours but this is very sturdy and durable.
RVH9D4BU9JMWK,kahuna is a two player game that requires strategy and a bit of luck.
RVH9D4BU9JMWK,"it was a big hit at my twelve year olds sleepover, with the kids picking up game play quickly."
RVH9D4BU9JMWK,they rated it 5 stars and declared it loads of fun.
RVH9D4BU9JMWK,"when adults in our family played, they didnt find it nearly as compelling, rating it 3 stars."
RVH9D4BU9JMWK,the fact thats its two player is a big plus and i like the fact that it appeals to a fairly wide range of ages.
RVH9D4BU9JMWK,they all found the cards a bit flimsy but that was the only complaint as far as the actual game quality.
RVH9D4BU9JMWK,"overall, i think itll get played most often by the tweens while the adults find other games that are a bit more challenging."
R1JIFU0R3I9R81,i ordered this hideaway olaf for my daughters birthday.
R1JIFU0R3I9R81,amazon has a great price on it that i couldnt resist so i had to snag it.
R1JIFU0R3I9R81,my daughter will be turning 5 and has been asking for this olaf for what seems like eternity .
R1JIFU0R3I9R81,"the olaf arrived in perfect shape and i know she is going to adore it, after all who doesnt like olaf?"
R1JIFU0R3I9R81,the olaf is very soft and perfect for cuddles.
R1JIFU0R3I9R81,i didnt take it out of the package so i didnt get any pictures but i played with it a little and the olaf is easy to roll into a ball just like other hide away pets.
R1JIFU0R3I9R81,"great price, great toy and one very happy birthday girl next month!"
R1JIFU0R3I9R81,thanks amazon !
R2QB7FN4YO9LLX,i was very disappointed.
R2QB7FN4YO9LLX,they did not stay upright.
R2QB7FN4YO9LLX,only floated on their side would not recommend
R23K077V6A1TV4,nice product
R1KIACJV6SCR5I,real nice cloths
R2PJGSG5KAPN6B,great
R1W2BTJWJLCIAL,i love this figure i hear people complain about his articulation his lack of ability to move was how you beat him in the game but anyway the design is awesome i love the way you can remove the helmet protective glass an the freeze gun design.
R3FM3UQ9QRNJQ9,these got here almost immediately.
R3FM3UQ9QRNJQ9,i am planning on using them as napkin rings for halloween.
R3FM3UQ9QRNJQ9,cant wait!
RKPZITV0N4HDV,i just received this and my one year old twins already knocked it over.
RKPZITV0N4HDV,this is so unsturdy.
RKPZITV0N4HDV,if a kid leans against a side at all the whole thing tips over.
RKPZITV0N4HDV,very upset with this purchase
RJNHY72UBL4Y1,"decent quality, just as listed on description  fast shipping."
R8ICP7H9Z2F4T,great lamp it really lights up.
R8ICP7H9Z2F4T,its is fun and great for all ages.
R8ICP7H9Z2F4T,i love how it changes colors with music or voice activated.
R8ICP7H9Z2F4T,really fun.
R3K94RYWHQG7HN,"fast, great, thank you"
R205257APZDCU,i loved this puzzle!
R205257APZDCU,its a great puzzle for grown ups.
R205257APZDCU,this is one of my favorite puzzles so far.
R205257APZDCU,the illustration is super adorable.
R205257APZDCU,im tempted to put it together again and frame it for my craft room.
R205257APZDCU,would recommend to grown ups and families alike.
R1WRLAIY1CCW6H,loved it!
R1WRLAIY1CCW6H,definitely worked as the perfect christmas gift.
RHJLG1UXSJBK4,best toy ever!
RHJLG1UXSJBK4,our children love this swing.
RHJLG1UXSJBK4,amazing that for so little money so much healthy outdoor fun!
R30GCWBTOFXCS1,cute bandaides for kiddies.
R30GCWBTOFXCS1,small but cute.
R2RJW2OSNBBBGJ,hard to find figure.
R2RJW2OSNBBBGJ,good price.
R2RJW2OSNBBBGJ,as described
R65THKELB77ID,love it
RISVPJDZGXR5K,very nice set for the price
R1K0XJ0UZFLH50,looks nice and adds a couple of rails.
R1K0XJ0UZFLH50,"like other modulus accessories, its mostly for looks."
R1K0XJ0UZFLH50,its a little wobbly when attached to the modulus.
R1K0XJ0UZFLH50,"not dramatically so, but enough to be noticeable."
R1K0XJ0UZFLH50,"works on other blasters that can mount a barrel extension, like the recon and the longshot."
R1K0XJ0UZFLH50,would probably look really cool on the white retaliator.
R300ABS56YXH3V,love using this tray!
R300ABS56YXH3V,tetris ice cubes are the best!
R39KHY4U43GCFO,everything was great.
R3RTY0QW15O5HV,very soft!
R2L55VWXE339VD,ok
R1GO1PSAN3OER5,nice.
R1GO1PSAN3OER5,what i expected but already coming lose but for the price a good buy!
R3QB6B9EM1Y1S1,yummy and perfect for my purpose!
R1RBQ8ENRZN1L4,"tools work well, but sometimes some residual play doh may be hard to get out of extruders."
R1RBQ8ENRZN1L4,the tools are fairly easy but take some effort for my 3.5yr old to use.
R1O3MGRXHMV074,great
R4T8QP43YBFJX,"much smaller than i imagined, but did the job"
RQGAOKYNF7VR0,"this set is a departure from the lego bricks, and with this set you are only building vehicles.i felt like the directions color booklet were easy to follow for an adult or a teen, but for a younger kid it just is too challenging."
RQGAOKYNF7VR0,"however you dont have to be limited to the directions, you can make any sort of free form vehicle you want."
RQGAOKYNF7VR0,"its nice though, to have the guide in case you need a little bit of guidance.pieces are sturdy and are not going to break on you."
RQGAOKYNF7VR0,most of the &34joint&34 pieces are yellow with a few black and orange ones thrown in.
RQGAOKYNF7VR0,"set comes with a set of wheels tank style, one drill attachment, one construction type man with a hat, and a pod for the man to fit in so he can drive."
RQGAOKYNF7VR0,"there are enough pieces to make a very elaborate vehicle.you can buy other sets and combine them together, and i suspect if your child is a fan of these that is what will have to happen."
RQGAOKYNF7VR0,"the box says ages 6 and up, but id say the ideal age would be 8 and up, because by that age they can read and follow the directions without adult help."
R1VLJ16P42V937,i wish that they would have had a size in the description!
R1VLJ16P42V937,extremely small!
R1VLJ16P42V937,probably a choking hazard!
R1VLJ16P42V937,do not recommend ...
RRGO5JYFEF6FE,just as much fun as i remember from my childhood.
RRGO5JYFEF6FE,thank you!
R2SEZM5UFBG1ZF,the large paper fan collapsed after one day.
R2SEZM5UFBG1ZF,i would like a replace to or refund.
R3K0WF00X7OMSO,there were 2 bags missing from our box.
R3K0WF00X7OMSO,"we called lego directly and they are sending the replacement bags, but this was a gift and it was disappointing that parts were missing."
R3ASCI5DCNC856,"big, giant googly eyes."
R3ASCI5DCNC856,yes.
RT8BFY2HF1SO0,her right eye has a little scratch ...
R2NIY98H8PBP4M,a fun puzzle.
RZTPUK43K5LI7,i recived this item free thru bzzagent.
RZTPUK43K5LI7,"my daughter is 8 years old and she was able to read the instructions, assemble the kit, and make a bracelet with her favorite ponys name before i could diaper our little one and get back to the den."
RZTPUK43K5LI7,she made bracelets for everyone in her class and they all loved them.
RZTPUK43K5LI7,the only issue is how do u get more bracelets and clasps without buying an entire new set.
RZTPUK43K5LI7,she had tons of ideas but for right now we are out of bracelets... i plan on taking a minute soon to research where to buy replacements.
R1FIM4FR8HVNXG,just as described.
R1FIM4FR8HVNXG,it is very cute!!!.
R1FIM4FR8HVNXG,.
R1FIM4FR8HVNXG,.
R1FIM4FR8HVNXG,she was my completion to my princess funko pops... love her.
R2FD7M764WY4TL,terrible is all i can say.
R2FD7M764WY4TL,i was in a hurry and didnt read the review and wish i had.
R2FD7M764WY4TL,it is way to hard to reload and shreds the bullets which are not cheap to replace.
R2FD7M764WY4TL,we own dozens of nerf guns and his is by far the worst.
R2FD7M764WY4TL,i should send it back.
RJVNC0A4NWXAN,"doesnt get hot, like the other lamps i have tried."
RX85HD20WM0LH,great figures for a good price.
RX85HD20WM0LH,i cant speak to their playability as i collect them and put them on display.
RX85HD20WM0LH,they do appear to be well built though.
R2TXNT2LSOUKUX,i have one it is great and durable
R2XO3HYJN3GPUE,"this is a great yoyo, and i love the fact that it comes with an extra string."
R2XO3HYJN3GPUE,but the problem is you can only do very simple tricks with it.
R2XO3HYJN3GPUE,"as soon as you learn some beginner moves it becomes useless when your trying to do other tricks with it, because the yoyo cant take it."
R2XO3HYJN3GPUE,"overall, great yoyo, but only for about a couple weeks before you get onto the more advanced tricks and need to buy a new yoyo"
R2OW3FSQ4TSGOY,too simple with only few songs and music
R1XEPD2YWGFFPS,the maracas arrived in good condition and they are cute.
R1XEPD2YWGFFPS,"i dont know how i missed the fact that they are only 3"" small."
R1XEPD2YWGFFPS,i was looking for something a little bigger.
R1XEPD2YWGFFPS,"anyway, i still think its a great giveaway."
R2DI1YLTQ3DCQG,"a little complex for a 3 year to play by herself, but its a great toy to have happy grammagranddaughter play."
R2DI1YLTQ3DCQG,she love it.
R2DI1YLTQ3DCQG,"good puzzle toy to teach patience and success, colors, visual interest."
R2DI1YLTQ3DCQG,im very satisfied.
R2DI1YLTQ3DCQG,"this activity is very entertaining for age 3, but not for younger children..."
R37E4Y9RE9CVWX,i bought this as a gift.
R37E4Y9RE9CVWX,the little girl loved it!
R37E4Y9RE9CVWX,it is so cute and worked perfectly right out of the box.
RR7MMJ4RQVTIQ,"wow what,a,great plane to fly.. i really like the detail and we quality of this product."
RR7MMJ4RQVTIQ,i highly recommend omens to buy it to anybody.
RR7MMJ4RQVTIQ,very realistic once in the air.
R2N7HBHIYCXSN4,a okay
R2O9CK3CKATBF,"my son loved it!but it is very hard to fly, and it will smash on the ground alot..so be prepared to order extra parts."
R5NNH24KFNPTL,assembled easily and very sturdy.
R5NNH24KFNPTL,nice storage and front tires swivel to help with pulling.
R3JZAOLD8UXZKV,"these are super cute, and they are legos!"
R3JZAOLD8UXZKV,"we used these to fill a toddler easter basket instead of candy, and they were a huge hit."
R29IYHPYD14AGI,i purchased this item for my 9 year old grand daughter for christmas.
R29IYHPYD14AGI,at first she didnt seem interested so i didnt push it.
R29IYHPYD14AGI,"after sitting on her shelf for a couple of months, she finally expressed an interest in learning to start to sew."
R29IYHPYD14AGI,upon opening it and going thru everything we decided to get started on the basic pouch so she could get used to the simple steps.the instructions were not clear enough for a nine year old to understand without lots of help from an adult.
R29IYHPYD14AGI,"i would like to have seen &34kid friendly &34 instructions included so she could feel more successful.the thread was very hard to get through the eye of the needle that was included in this kit, so i gave her a needle with a larger eye, from my sewing kit.after the beginning project, she was able to complete the stuffed animal projects with a little to no assistance from me.although i do not sew as a hobby, this was a good place for my grand daughter to start exploring the sewing world and i think shes hooked!"
RF7FIKBO7ANMZ,"the power cord came cut, so there was no way to connect the battery to power it on."
RF7FIKBO7ANMZ,"this was a gift, and i wasnt able to open it until my son returned from school, and by then it was too late to do anything about it."
R31TC3DA782B00,my son loved his leap pad.. but in the divorce some how my wife just took it n that was that  none at my house for him.so in comes this version of it.
R31TC3DA782B00,already hes amazed.
R31TC3DA782B00,"its better, bigger, nicer, sleaker."
R31TC3DA782B00,"cooler, more features n functions for sure!!"
R31TC3DA782B00,we like it has a much larger screen n better graphics especially for kids!.
R31TC3DA782B00,its rough n tough but id suggest get a case and a screen protector on amazon or ebay!
R31TC3DA782B00,sound quality is superb for sure.. the stylus is a bit better than past versions too.. and the battery is a huge step up!
R31TC3DA782B00,omg... much much better for sure.it says its 8gb but it seems like 4 or 5 is avail to use.. is the rest for pics or what??
R31TC3DA782B00,i dunno but its weird.
R31TC3DA782B00,"def gotta register online for sure.. the wifi is for buying n downloading apps only  but either way i still love this!so, this device has loads of potential but if you are planning to give it to a kid who has played with an ipad or kindle fire, you might have a disappointed kid."
R31TC3DA782B00,they might even look at you like you have three heads and came from a different planet.
R31TC3DA782B00,"also, the age range listed it 39. once again, no 69 year old that i know is going to be happy with the limited offerings of this device."
R3EH9BCX2PGN8D,it was a gift and my grand daughter loved it
R3SMXLDBCANYXV,excellent
RWO6MQ969U3M6,i loved it!
RWO6MQ969U3M6,bigger than i expected.
R3G8R8AN1OPBDO,elissabat is one of my favorite characters and when i saw this doll i had to get it.
R3G8R8AN1OPBDO,i have no regrets.
R3G8R8AN1OPBDO,she is a doll.!
R3G8R8AN1OPBDO,and now i hate myself for that pun..
R1W0462121SMSA,these were very easy to swap onto the plasma car and the difference is amazing.i got these along with the plasma car for my niece.
R1W0462121SMSA,apparently she was riding it around her neighborhood and a little friend wanted to try hers.
R1W0462121SMSA,he had one of his own but had original wheels.
R1W0462121SMSA,"he rode it and had a hard time giving it up telling his parents, &34hers rides so much better than mine!&34dont even bother getting a plasma car without getting the replacement wheels."
R3JMCQIAVPGHBJ,"my 8 year old is 54"", she wanted this doll because she was very tall like her."
R3JMCQIAVPGHBJ,a hit!
R1ED80TMIQ2B9W,kids love them
R117RQ19UAZ68X,"they were too small, thought would be a little bigger"
R2SH6FSARBKXBZ,this should have been a beautiful puzzle.
R2SH6FSARBKXBZ,"however, no fewer than 6 pieces were missing."
R2SH6FSARBKXBZ,the puzzle itself is darker than the photo on the package and this in turn made it difficult to identify pieces.
R2SH6FSARBKXBZ,there was also relatively little variation in the shape of the pieces so thatin areas where there as no pattern to use as a guide see upper leftit was very easy to substitute a wrong piece for the correct one.
R2SH6FSARBKXBZ,we were willing to put up with these last two issues given the beauty of the painting on which the puzzle is based.
R2SH6FSARBKXBZ,"but to find out that we were 6 pieces short after working on the puzzle for more than a week, was the last straw."
R2SH6FSARBKXBZ,well stick to ravensburger puzzles from now on.
R1AI1CDYKDSLEY,made game night a hit!
R1AI1CDYKDSLEY,the board is hard to read dark colorsitems drawn on board close together.
R1AI1CDYKDSLEY,well worth the $10 i paid for it.
R1FGG43U91538I,"these are easy to fill which is great, but not useable."
R1FGG43U91538I,they do not fill with enough water to break when thrown and a bunch of ours did not hold the fill either.
R1FGG43U91538I,"in order to get them to break you have to throw them really, really hard."
R1FGG43U91538I,it was very disappointing for me and my kids.
R1FGG43U91538I,i will not buy again nor do i recommend them.
R23GKAKZX5KG3Q,this is a fun game  quick set up and different game play each time.
R23GKAKZX5KG3Q,the only negative is that there was a piece missing.
R23GKAKZX5KG3Q,"fortunately it was a pretty easy piece to replace the water level marker, but it cause a bit of confusion at first."
R2IJS80C237IVM,"really liked the size and durability of the wood, but the paint started chipping off the cars after about a month or so."
R2IJS80C237IVM,"too bad, was a cute toy, it went in the recycling since i didnt want paint chips all over our house we have a dog that eats everything, and a smaller children that come over to play a lot"
R3QWNHWSCXW3VH,this thing was an awesome bday gift
R1LSDU1TS8H00P,love the tattoos!
R2S2FXAJDGUF09,oh muh gawd!
R2S2FXAJDGUF09,these cubes spin faster than lady gaga on a disco stick!!!
R2S2FXAJDGUF09,imagine riding the gravatron at your local fair...thats how fast the cibe spins!!!
R2S2FXAJDGUF09,ever seen a helicopters blades once the bird goes to take off?
R2S2FXAJDGUF09,"imagine that as you flick your cube rdrd to put the final brick in place.prosspins fast, stickers dont peel after thousands of uses, feels nice in my hands, perfect for pockets and handbagsconsstill single doesnt get the ladies moist like description says."
R3JNU2JOI2Y0TU,she is what i expected thank you
RPJ5JTL6I785,sturdy wooden pieces were great for my 3 year old who is still getting the concept of puzzles.
RPJ5JTL6I785,"she can whiz through this one now, and its still in great shape!"
R17PICNO9SAYAS,good wallet for a young child  easy to use and colorful.
R1Q8IC56R73SWG,very nice because these princess shoes are adjustable.
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"a truly wonderful collector item.i was at first a bit disappointed when i noticed that it is not the original rx78 from the first gundam series, but then got used to the new design.there are a ton of parts it is impressive how many small little parts are included with this figure this is because there are 3 different variations that you can make which involve swapping parts from the arms, legs, shoulder and chest pieces."
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,the changes are minimal so you will just end up picking the parts that you like and leave the figure as is.
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"the only noticeable change is some chrome parts, which are nice, althought they do not fit really well the anime version.the figure itself is a bargain it is mostly made of metal, and i was surprised to see how nice it is, considering that other gundam models from the same line, cost 100 dollars more."
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"i thought it was defective or had issues, but this figure exceed my expectations.i build gunpla, and i like them, although with time, the joints become loose and the plastic brittle, so i decided to replace my favorite figures with more durable version."
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"this is not as fun as to build a gunpla, but the superior durability is a great plus.the articulations are really solid and heavy all major joints are in metal and posing the figure is a pleasure, since it moves fluidly, without feel too stiff or too loose."
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"good range of motion, kneeling is perfect, and you wont have issues to put the figure in any pose you like.the negatives are few the first is the head movement that is somehow limited when using the shoulder cannon."
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"the cannon itself is fixed and the articulation is plastic which is prone to be snapped or get bad with time not sure why bandai didnt go the extra mile to make this figure great.another downside of the figure is the shield it fall apart as soon as you touch it, and checking on variouos forums, it seems that most of the collectors simply superglue the various parts of the shield, so it wont fall apart when posing the figure."
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"the handle itself is great, snaps nicely, but the part where the handle goes on and hold basically the shield to the forearm, just snap off as soon as you breathe on it same goes for the saber holder and the extra rifle holder."
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"just a dab of glue and the shield will stay solid, when connected to the forearm nothing that would damage the value of the figure.the gundam opens too and can hold inside a core fighter which is a small foldable airplane."
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"in the main show the cool part was the little jet folding and connecting with torso and legs to create different setup, making it a modular robot so you can recreate the feel of the original anime if you like."
RYQB9PBZ8LG5P,"there is also a plastic piece that holds the torso and legs together in case you want to display the core fighter on its own once it is inside the gundam, there is no way to actually see it i keep it outside also because i do not want to separate the figure and eventually scratch the paint.overall, buy it now if you are a fan of gundam, but also as action figure, it is a great purchase, even if you never heard of gundam.he various parts of the shield, so it wont fall apart when posing the figure."

R2AJUBLNK6UM2B,"simple, basic blocks for small childs hands."
R2AJUBLNK6UM2B,"they were a bit smaller than i expected, but for a toddlers size hand they would probably be perfect."
R2AJUBLNK6UM2B,i used them at a baby shower and sent them home with the expectant mom.
R3YINLHMRJNJ7,this bobblehead is for my friend and i know she gonna love it.
R3YINLHMRJNJ7,i also bought myself the michelle and obama bobbleheads.
R3YINLHMRJNJ7,the bobbleheads looked exactly like themt too.
R3YINLHMRJNJ7,its awesome!
R2I0UAEDP03PFB,family of 5. i lost the first game with a wild accusation and won the second game with everyone in awe.
R2I0UAEDP03PFB,its a fun game.
R2I0UAEDP03PFB,"mid 30s, 11, 8, 5. everyone had a blast except the 5 year old."
R2I0UAEDP03PFB,shes a little young to understand the strategy.
R2I0UAEDP03PFB,"put down the iphones, ipodspads, turn off the tv and play a game with the kids or friends."
R1ZM5DXXFYJO4G,kids love it
R2N8F74ATALR8M,a great game that the whole family can play.
R2N8F74ATALR8M,"well made, simple rules and quick setup."
R2N8F74ATALR8M,"less complicated and easier to learn than chess, but more strategy and thinking than checkers and not much more difficult to learn."
R2ZCQ7OUVDTBQN,gift for my godson and he loved it.
R1B6PYEOF9X4A1,"yes it flys outside, but if you have just about any headwind whatsoever it will easily push the chopper to the ground, or it may end up on the top of your roof, or in the street with cars."
R1B6PYEOF9X4A1,"you basically need a park area with no wind, or a large gym or open room that you can fly it without hitting someone."
RO9MSV0QBLSVO,"very nice doll, my daughter is very happy with it"
R2NRXQSJOKIQUU,good seller and good products
R3TAVHC4FD4L3W,terrific!

R36N2AIYVP0B80,these make a wonderful toy to carry in your pocket or purse for emergencies
R4SR05EOBVI88,my 1 yr old loves this!
R4SR05EOBVI88,hes definitely too small for it but he has no problems sitting on it and getting pushed around  we had a radio flyer one yrs ago for my older son and im much happier with the schwinn.
R4SR05EOBVI88,"i like that it has pegs for his feet, which he cant reach yet but will in time."
R4SR05EOBVI88,it has 2 baskets and the one in the rear dumps.
R4SR05EOBVI88,it also has a little backpack attached to the back of the seat.
R4SR05EOBVI88,also like the wheels are plastic so we dont have to worry about tire pressure or flat tires.
R4SR05EOBVI88,it went over the bumps just fine.
R4SR05EOBVI88,very happy with this purchase!
R36B2UDBMQ24S3,great product!
R2YV4CKOYQ3L0H,"we like the way the tiles sit so they dont move around, but the board is disappointingly small compared to a normal board, so only 4 stars."
R15HFDTZO30DPF,exactly as described.
R15HFDTZO30DPF,really great looking when put together.
R1MA0YNM7H8GVI,daughter loves this doll.
R1MA0YNM7H8GVI,sings a good amount of her song.
R1U7JGC2DIEYUL,fairy came in on time but the head was broken almost all the way off.
R1U7JGC2DIEYUL,poor packaging.
R1U7JGC2DIEYUL,but was fixable with super glue.
R1U7JGC2DIEYUL,looked great on my cake!
R3ABLXPA4RH3G0,my granddaughters beautiful cinderella doll finally found a worthy prince!
R3ABLXPA4RH3G0,very happy.
R3ABLXPA4RH3G0,thanks.
R15L4258UTEUH9,i thought i was getting something that transformed.
R15L4258UTEUH9,my grandson knew it didnt so i was disappointed.
R2CTOT0LU2BLR6,she is so pretty!
R2CTOT0LU2BLR6,she is the daughter of the fairy godmother.
R2CTOT0LU2BLR6,"shes got pale pink skin, light blue and light purple hair, a silver headband, a blue and silver dress, blue flatish shoes, a silver magic wand awesome, and silvery, spider web like wings."
R2CTOT0LU2BLR6,"but, she looks like she would be the daughter of the blue fairy instead of the fairy godmothers daughter."
R2CTOT0LU2BLR6,right?
R2CTOT0LU2BLR6,am i alone in this or do up agree???
R2CTOT0LU2BLR6,?
R16GNGYXO0NCR8,good product..
R1MVYBO2AVORVN,fun toy.
R1MVYBO2AVORVN,i was disappointed when the hat fell off.
R1MVYBO2AVORVN,i had to super glue it back on.
R23CQ6IC9GRI6F,"great item, good condition, came as arrived, very fun gift."
R2JQ2WVUZLOXBD,"dress material is not really fabric, seems a thin plastic."
R2JQ2WVUZLOXBD,much less expensive than retail barbie clothing but construction and material shows it.
R2JQ2WVUZLOXBD,bought two packages and of the 10 dresses one was bad sewing came apart.
R2JQ2WVUZLOXBD,"granddaughter will play with these, but will not last and cheap feeling."
R2JQ2WVUZLOXBD,would not buy again.
R1311L7B9ALQ36,love it
R3OR7UIZ3F521X,"my ftv angels just arrived today, and i can honestly say it is one of them most beautiful from the vault products yet!"
R3OR7UIZ3F521X,i honestly feel wizards did a great job putting together this set.
R3OR7UIZ3F521X,"the 15 cards included are all angels as the name implies, and the most expensive one, avacyn, was $30 at the time of this release."
RKTTP0Q6T19R2,gift for my husband who absolutely loved it
R1J53WO8JKH02E,my new grandson loved this turtle but not nearly as much as his mother loved it.
R1J53WO8JKH02E,it will keep him entertained for months to come.
R1J53WO8JKH02E,quality product and super fast shipping
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,the telescope itself is really very good.
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,even with the lowest magnification lens attached the housemate and i were able to see saturn and discern the gap between the planet and its rings.
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,"with a higher magnification, things became much clearer, and even more exciting."
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,the first clear image of the moon took my breath away.the drawbacks?
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,its very hard to use standing up.
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,"i realize its made for children, but i think a taller tripod might have been a plus here."
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,even sitting we had to hunch down to see anything at a 45 degree angle or above.
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,"also, the viewfinder did not help at all."
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,i found all the objects we wanted to see by sighting along the barrel of the telescope itself.
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,"now possibly i attached the viewfinder the wrong way, though there really only seems to be one way to do it."
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,"either way, we saw what we intended to see which made the exercise worthwhile.why a telescope?"
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,arent you and your children worth it?
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,dont you want to learn more about even our part of the universe?
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,"this is an amazing gift for the children in your life, or even for yourself."
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,"its lightweight and easy to transport and with the help of something like google sky, you can figure out what it is youre looking at with ease."
R2W8ZGCTYOOFR0,"its a step on the road to becoming better educated in astronomy, and it should spark a sense of wonder anyone who looks up and longs to know more."
R2GL1M14Y79OIJ,cant wait to give to my grandson.
RJ9NFNV5TXJI3,"the sound is great, the music is very good."
RJ9NFNV5TXJI3,"it was a little bit tall for my two year old, but we could fix that."
RJ9NFNV5TXJI3,she feels like an artist and manipulates it very well.
R2QSR6I8IX6EX4,i dont have any items
R1UBKQ1NL0KGSG,pricey for what you get.
R3U3LPPZGKJG98,nice watch.
R3U3LPPZGKJG98,thanks
R1SRI6QCB8NTW0,"these are quality lowvision cards, which are good for both lowvision players, with a large index on the right, and other players, with a traditional jumboindex on the left."
R2OYXWVO65I55Y,grandaugher is one year old and loves it..remember that this toy is a fold away..great space saver..
R1ODQ4PIJABMLP,nice!
R1GH5SRCIXW19O,its a great looking puzzle that is quite unique!
R1GH5SRCIXW19O,great for any puzzle or star wars fan!
R3OT7E1L17QASJ,nice if you want to play cards with something different.
R3OT7E1L17QASJ,i think it wouldve been nice if there were more pics though.
R2CDF56Y1MIQ1A,loved it!
R2CDF56Y1MIQ1A,bigger than i expected.
RSV43KWLVA0J9,finally had a chance on a summer rainy day to put this puzzle together only to determine there were missing pieces.
RSV43KWLVA0J9,very disappointed as it was a gift for neighbor!
R18CJ2ZNE434ZZ,"wonderful for the little boy for his party, was a party hit!"
RUTNQW3UYPREF,my daughter couldnt ride this thing because it kept falling forward with every bounce.
RUTNQW3UYPREF,its feet are located where she needed to place hers.
RUTNQW3UYPREF,this would maybe be better for an oldertaller child.
RUTNQW3UYPREF,"also, the hand pump came broken."
RUTNQW3UYPREF,luckily we had ordered a similar toy at the same time and we were able to get it inflated.
RUTNQW3UYPREF,it is easy to inflate and veey cute.
RUTNQW3UYPREF,i wish it would have worked out better for us.
RYCLW53RFKMB7,my son loves these socks very comfortable and they wash very easily.
RYCLW53RFKMB7,they held up very well he is very hard on clothing and they have lasted a long time.
R3T9QVO3QFBIPG,got these way before estimated delivery date and i love them.
R3T9QVO3QFBIPG,"im a huge halloween fan and i decorate to the last detail and these flies are perfect, very realistic looking, just the right ""fly"" size and seem pretty sturdy."
R3GJ8JWE2FR6GE,high quality and exactly what i wanted
R58OTN22CKXF5,"with well defined faces to each coin side and a chronologically sorted listing and description on the back of the display, the set is of good quality and informative to owners both new and familiar with egyptian history."
R58OTN22CKXF5,"each description provides an overview for both sides of the coin, making identification easy, before then describing the historical context of the individuals depicted."
R58OTN22CKXF5,"it would have been nice to have the coins arranged in chronological order on the front as well, but thanks to the well written descriptions it would be hard to mistake the coins for one another anyways.each coin is fastened to the card stock display via glue, and then enveloped in a thick clear plastic sleeve making it easy to keep the display in good condition if you keep the coins attached."
R58OTN22CKXF5,"the display card itself shows an impressive amount of organization for the informative text, and the images are both crisp and well placed."
R58OTN22CKXF5,"the sheen of the coins are beautiful, the gold ones in particular seem to shine no matter how little light their exposed to.all in all a very worthwhile purchase for any egyptian history enthusiast."
R15KMN3HTSERGY,do not buy this.
R15KMN3HTSERGY,"extremely cheap plastic, stickers come off easily, stiff, hard to turn."
R15KMN3HTSERGY,my son hated it within 10 seconds of opening the box.
R15KMN3HTSERGY,"them calling this a ""speedcube"" is an outright lie."
R15KMN3HTSERGY,its the worst turning cube ive ever seen.
R1N1Z16CFOP09E,4 of the 10 i used did not work
R2VDG1SNETIK8W,i use these for fabric storage.
R2VDG1SNETIK8W,they are stiff enough and they are like little bolts of cloth that i can store in book shelves in my sewing room.
R2VDG1SNETIK8W,i can store a lot more fabric in a lot less space and i can see the colors and patterns easily.
R2UE12QO3NRZD7,these are so fun.
R2UE12QO3NRZD7,my son loves legos so much we bought 2 of these boxes.
R2UE12QO3NRZD7,i highly recommend these for any young child that loves to build things.
R2JT98591XR8SJ,love it
R1DOKZYQ2YW1J1,"updated review after a few months of usagefor a costume, this actually holds up pretty well."
R1DOKZYQ2YW1J1,"my daughter wears it at least a couple times a week, so it gets frequently washed and even worn outside."
R1DOKZYQ2YW1J1,the only thing i must warn about is the glitter.
R1DOKZYQ2YW1J1,it gets on everything.
R1DOKZYQ2YW1J1,"even after washing, our entire load of laundry was coated in glitter for the first couple of washes."
R1DOKZYQ2YW1J1,"there is still enough on the dress to make it sparkle, though."
R2NSPCT4LG6XDN,worked great for my son to pitch with
R1W208Q06CCOGS,"great little props, handy backups."
R1XEWZOGBEUFKU,a
R3G4TOTFWM70S4,soooo cute!
R3G4TOTFWM70S4,must have for any frozen fan!
R1L3G7J8KVN3DW,this was for my 8 year old son and he loves that it glows in the dark!
RH0UJSSDIZW8T,"we had hoped to use this at restaurants and other places where we wanted to keep our kids quietly occupied, but i find this product disappointing."
RH0UJSSDIZW8T,"the idea is great, and the case itself is wellmade, but not welldesigned for something that is supposed to be carried around by younger children."
RH0UJSSDIZW8T,"the pocket for the crayon is sideways oriented, and its just a loose pocket, so it doesnt actually hold the crayons with any firmness and they fall out regularly, as do the crayon sharpener and the little rag that is supposed to be an eraser."
RH0UJSSDIZW8T,"if the case had a zipper, these faults might not be a problem, but as is, this case leaves a trail of missing dry erase crayons wherever it goes, and especially all over our car."
RH0UJSSDIZW8T,older kids might be able to keep it contained by altering the way they carry it.
R1OZGCZFD8AIWP,the leapfrog leapreader is an awesome product!
R1OZGCZFD8AIWP,you slide the leapreader pen across the pages and it reads.
R1OZGCZFD8AIWP,"also, when you touch a work with it, itll sound out the word for you."
R1OZGCZFD8AIWP,my little nephew loved the paw patrol!
R1OZGCZFD8AIWP,"the book, the great robot rescue, had so many sounds that it kept his attention through out the entire story."
R1OZGCZFD8AIWP,"he loved it so much, he wanted to read it again."
R1OZGCZFD8AIWP,i definitely recommend this product to anyone.
R3E9QTS3CZSX1X,have used this all summer but took the advice of others and didnt blow it up to the max and had no issues.
R3E9QTS3CZSX1X,perfect for the pool and enjoying the sun but staying cool by being partially in the water!
R2UGFH3QHGMV1H,very high quality.
R2UGFH3QHGMV1H,my 20 month old loves it!
R1Y1CQNDJWL09T,my friends and i love monopoly.
R1Y1CQNDJWL09T,we had this about 3 years ago but somehow the bank started to malfunction so we decided to get another one and we are at it again every weekend!
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,this is the entire and complete set for bambinoluk.
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,the books are listed for age 35 but you might be able to use them even with a slightly younger child.
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,to use them you must place an open book under a beyond123 bambinoluk controller... then you move tiles from the top to bottom page to answer the questions.
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,"these books range in difficultly so kids can work at their own pace.for very young kids and special education... i suggest you buy the age 2 special primary book set as it focuses on the images on those 6 tiles, how to read the luk icons, how to do luk selfchecking, etc."
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,my just 2 year old really got into the primary books and was then able to do some of the books in this age 35 set.
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,"however, my son cannot do the self checking and only matches &34same to same.&34overall, these books so far have really grown my sons attention to detail, but some things seem too high of a level for him like matching opposites or things that go together."
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,"also, some pages are pretty hard for him since he is only two like matching flowers when all the options are red and yellow  could only tell them apart by the petalscenter sizes."
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,"clearly this is meant for 35 year olds, but i am very surprised how a little instruction of how to distinguish between objects, then the light goes on and my son figures out the matching.overall, i am surprised how tricky some of the questions are and how it gets kids to work on that critical thinking  visual perception at a young age by removing the need to write."
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,i personally think they should make a set for 12 year olds without the self checking system and to be used with an instructoradult who does the checking instead.
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,my son would have been very very happy to play this game earlier and for a longer time frame.
R1U90D3Z6HA7V3,i intend to buy more from this company.i have organized the books by &34difficulty packs&34 in the following lists...set 1 my first workbook intro to the type of questions kids will face and helps you explain anything kids do not get at first so they can succeed in the books on their own see and sort zoo animals concentration games what belongs together starting to countset 2 seek and compare farm animals more concentration games think and associate starting to do additionset 3 identify and relate brainteasers for kids what belongs together 2 all about colors and shapes transportation and traffic signsto the type of questions kids will face and helps you explain anything kids do not get at first so they can succeed in the books on their own see and sort zoo animals concentration games what belongs together starting to countset 2 seek and compare farm animals more concentration games think and associate starting to do additionset 3 identify and relate brainteasers for kids what belongs together 2 all about colors and shapes transportation and traffic signs

R3AR1L41Y99BP,thanks
R1IP9CAGEHTIZ5,lots of space to hold shopkins
R3PKTHY8M82BAJ,i bought this bear last year from qvc for a friend.
R3PKTHY8M82BAJ,"it is so cute, that i almost didnt want to give it up."
R3PKTHY8M82BAJ,"qvc doesnt carry it anymore, so i am going to buy one from amazon for another friend."
R3PKTHY8M82BAJ,"i dont think it mentions that the bear sings a lullabye and says ""good night dear friend""."
R3PKTHY8M82BAJ,precious!
R15XBG4M0DI6WC,was exactly as described.
R15XBG4M0DI6WC,quick ship.
R15XBG4M0DI6WC,love it.
R1C9P15XI7M1L1,grandson is very happy.
R1C9P15XI7M1L1,thank you
R3O6741S4XOGK2,"i love, love, love this game."
R3O6741S4XOGK2,"i usually lose but unlike with many games where i consistently lose, it has not discouraged me or caused me to lose interest.it usually takes around 45 minutes to play we did have one game go over an hour but thats rare."
R3O6741S4XOGK2,"we have played it more than 40 times in the 2 months that weve owned it, and weve played it with varying groups of people and have yet to find someone that didnt like it, a rarity.its all managing your resources in order to achieve high score quickly, simple to learn with enough strategy to keep everyone coming back."
R3O6741S4XOGK2,its hard to imagine anyone who likes board games not wanting this one in their collection.our current favorite game!
R20YCDUAPB1JHD,love it
R13BQDUDR6JLGJ,great addition to my grandsons collection
RDF7NCK0ULEE1,perfect of a 1 year old
R3SIC5AZ8QVJEC,son loves hyenas
R2JS3JD2ZTRUWA,my son sits to low in this and gets water in his mouth!!!
R2JS3JD2ZTRUWA,!
R35ZLI0GB7E2KH,this game is so fun!
R35ZLI0GB7E2KH,it really envelops you in the regency world of pride and prejudice.
R35ZLI0GB7E2KH,it is simple to learn but really fun for everyone to play.
R35ZLI0GB7E2KH,my husband loves card games and i love jane austen so it is a perfect match for us.
R35ZLI0GB7E2KH,i highly recommend!!
R35ZLI0GB7E2KH,!
R2UH9CJLA7UFZB,these tires are impossible to find.
R2UH9CJLA7UFZB,this was a great find for my lego kiddos.
R152RFUPDOTGLI,"great lego set, i loved it a lot."
R152RFUPDOTGLI,it was a simple but good lego set.
R2DK3HBKNHJEMC,this is an amazing toy its have both a major helicopter what my son loves and he plays with it for our hours and when he finishes he go to the beautiful air plain what has beautiful color lights and major sounds what it makes hem very excited and com i really recommended
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,this game is pretty deep and enjoyable.
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,"we have played twice and despite a midnight finish and about 4 hours in, we havent finished a 3p game yet we got to turn 6 of 8!."
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,i think everyone is sort of enjoying how the factions work different.
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,theres lots of cool thematic things space marines have a card that lets them use their fortresses as factories to produce units.
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,seems cool!
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,"chaos is all about cultists sprouting up on new planets, so they can expand without actually moving their ships and marines into new systems.anyways, not a game for the faint of heart."
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,its very competitive and rewards careful decision making.
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,you can really screw yourself over or get screwed over by your opponents if youre not careful.
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,"theres some luck in the combat, but the order selection is all bluffing and strategy with no random elements except what your opponents are going to do.im going to try to bust this one out a lot more on our game night to get everyone used to it."
R1WATL71ZEHEAL,i think theres really a lot of &34play&34 in this one.
RAA1AC72S76NN,the lite did not come on
R3KMZI4Z16GQQ2,perfect for our son.
R3KMZI4Z16GQQ2,high quality bounce house.
R1BTK8V1AGJ9M3,awesome
RC9II93P35N2I,"these packs are so overpriced for what you get, and you need packs 35 if you want access to the player aids for the factions expansion."
RC9II93P35N2I,the base game of alien frontiers just plays so much smoother than adding factions with these expansion packs.
RM1QCNPCYREF5,beautiful dress
R1BAW816OJGYJJ,son loves!
R1BAW816OJGYJJ,"not too many boys want to admit they like something soft to cuddle at night, but this is the perfect blend of cozy and cool."
RHVOX14L4MJK4,another great product from t&k.
RHVOX14L4MJK4,my son loves these.
RHVOX14L4MJK4,a little pricey but better than the average toy.
RHVOX14L4MJK4,only complaints are 1 the wheels fall off easily.
RHVOX14L4MJK4,wish there was a way to secure them.
RHVOX14L4MJK4,2 theres no way to use the remotes on different frequencies so if you have two or more kits the remotes will interfere with each other.
R36S59E5CCZ1G8,i ordered these a long time ago and had used them on my littles bday cake.
R36S59E5CCZ1G8,well this year my other son wanted a dino cake and i had saved these in our birthday box.
R36S59E5CCZ1G8,they came in handy and are now being played with in the bath.
R2LE2U6C8RSYTL,this is really not a good purchase at all.
R2LE2U6C8RSYTL,i bought after my kids played someone elses toy harmonicas and loved them.
R2LE2U6C8RSYTL,i thought these were they.
R2LE2U6C8RSYTL,but alas.
R2LE2U6C8RSYTL,"its too big, hard to play i dont know if it really plays a tune at all, and i think the one i meant to buy was the hohner."
R2LE2U6C8RSYTL,"sorry, kids... usually i like melissa and doug."
R2MAFNDW0YDQN1,it looks absolutely amazing in my daughters room.
R2MAFNDW0YDQN1,"i only put her smaller toys in it for safety purposes & put extra nails around it for reinforcements, but dont get me wrong, it is stretchy & very durable."
R2MAFNDW0YDQN1,im extremely satisfied with my purchase.
R2MAFNDW0YDQN1,its decorative & organized at the same time.
R2MAFNDW0YDQN1,"i never write reviews, but i highly recommend this item."
R38WFOMNH32E4V,these scripture stickers are great for any age!
R38WFOMNH32E4V,i use them in my lds primary sunday school class as incentive for the students to bring their scriptures to class each week.
R38WFOMNH32E4V,they coordinate so well with the lessons!
R38WFOMNH32E4V,the kids absolutely love them and i love what they add to the pages of the scriptures.
R38WFOMNH32E4V,when flipping through the scriptures these can help you easily find stories youre looking for especially for children.
R38WFOMNH32E4V,most of them maybe all match wellknown church artwork that also coincides with the lessons.
R38WFOMNH32E4V,"they add pop and color to your scriptures, but it is still very easy to read through them."
R38WFOMNH32E4V,these would make the perfect gift!
R2YTAHNAH01CXG,i read prior reviews and was hoping these would be good.
R2YTAHNAH01CXG,they are thicker than the lego brand.
R2YTAHNAH01CXG,i think there lack of flexibilityfrom being thicker causes large lego base plates not to lay totally flat.
R2YTAHNAH01CXG,the plates were not visually warped the larger plates would not lay flat.
R2YTAHNAH01CXG,building with smaller bricks seems to work fine..
R3GYG4YHHQDYCL,arrived as expected.
R3GYG4YHHQDYCL,"its about my 10th pair, so i like them."
R2BAWIEIO2UWC9,reseonable price... its a good buy for the money
RBYAGOCALQLQX,great lay but was not ready for attachment she would not stop coming over..... it was a one night stand!
RDGC21TA7D631,it is large print which helps.
RDGC21TA7D631,only complaint is the bet limit is $50.00
R3UFTE0FVNDZIU,great figures for a good price.
R3UFTE0FVNDZIU,i cant speak to their playability as i collect them and put them on display.
R3UFTE0FVNDZIU,they do appear to be well built though.
R7EHN9MHAU5A2,very cute favors for birthday party!
R197VSSXFVF3L7,i absolutely love it!
R197VSSXFVF3L7,it was exactly what i expected.
R197VSSXFVF3L7,thank you so much for your promptness.
R312CR3Z2JIM7H,great!
R2Q69AG7KGRC9D,my little 2 year old grandson loved being buzz!!
R2Q69AG7KGRC9D,it was real to him.
R24LCQXFTVFVGN,this is the game you remember.
R24LCQXFTVFVGN,"buy this one, not the flimsy newer design."
RPS8KOQN076PG,"perfect, love it ...."
R2CM80MQRYRUCZ,i was a little apprehensive purchasing this lamp worrying that it would come broken in the mail like other reviews mentioned.
R2CM80MQRYRUCZ,but it arrived securely packaged in a great condition.
R2CM80MQRYRUCZ,i love this lamp.
R2CM80MQRYRUCZ,it was bigger then i thought it would be and has a great presence.
R2CM80MQRYRUCZ,so glad i ordered it!!
R2CM80MQRYRUCZ,!
R2KTUYLVOJM9IV,they are too small for little ones
R1S1S56W30GAXJ,awesome
RK5G8IC38THTR,good product.
RK5G8IC38THTR,bought it for my 10 year old grandson and we put it together over two days.
RK5G8IC38THTR,fascinating and educational for him.
RK5G8IC38THTR,buy it!
R1AFG2T51K2DDV,happy with the purchase totally.
R389W1RZ2C03U1,"works great, but the cocking mechanism is somewhat hard to use."
R1T08TSJTMXOAA,my 9 year old loved it!
RSW2Y4TPO6I3S,my kids loved this toy.
RSW2Y4TPO6I3S,they are huge marvel fans and this just made their day.
RSW2Y4TPO6I3S,the color comes off a little after daily use but nothing i would expect the way my boys run through toys.
RSW2Y4TPO6I3S,i recommend it to all with marvel fans.
R28NP5L4U2Y1JH,cardboard box cheaply made
R6JZXZDK3OF1H,my nephew loved it!
R3PIUTOW19B4O0,we did a summer road trip with the kids!
R3PIUTOW19B4O0,this was perfect we all enjoyed this even the adults!
R3PIUTOW19B4O0,no mess being that its magnets and it closes to keep everything tidy and no loosing the pieces!
R3PIUTOW19B4O0,would buy this again i absolutely love this!
R3HWUHM3SB4NBA,awesome game.
R3HWUHM3SB4NBA,like others i was looking for rail baron but did not want to pay the ridiculous price.
R3HWUHM3SB4NBA,"as it turns out, this is the original rail baron."
R3HWUHM3SB4NBA,"the only thing i dont like is how the board folds, but that is how many do now a days and it doesnt affect game play."
R3HWUHM3SB4NBA,great game!
R27N7AP362USRT,kids definitely love it!
R2CP2497Q26EFY,ahh!!!
R2CP2497Q26EFY,its so cute!!!!!!
R2CP2497Q26EFY,one of my favorite plushies now!
R2CP2497Q26EFY,thank god it wasnt vacuum sealed.
R31VIEO0O07632,"it is tough to know where, or how, to start and so i will just create a list when the bike arrived it had a huge black rubber tire mark on the frame that would not come off."
R31VIEO0O07632,this mark must have been from storage before shipment.
R31VIEO0O07632,"we returned this bike, as we thought it was a onetime mistake."
R31VIEO0O07632,the next bike we received had the same black tire mark on the frame.
R31VIEO0O07632,the rear skewer was not included in the package.
R31VIEO0O07632,after contacting smart gear they agreed to send the proper rear skewer and a new frame.
R31VIEO0O07632,smart gear sent the wrong replacement frame.
R31VIEO0O07632,smart gear finally sent the correct replacement frame.
R31VIEO0O07632,smart gear sent the wrong skewer.
R31VIEO0O07632,i sent the bike back for a refund.
R31VIEO0O07632,smart gears quality control is pretty bad.
R31VIEO0O07632,"while they were helpful on the phone, they messed up twice on rectifying the situation."
R31VIEO0O07632,"really abysmal customer service, in the end."
R31VIEO0O07632,we purchased another brands balance bike.
R31VIEO0O07632,"i would avoid any debacles and steer clear of smart gear, as it seems, perhaps, that they are too big to control how things are processedcontrolled."
R31VIEO0O07632,a really frustrating experience.
R1PIYDYV86KCMC,the gift was amaizing ... thanks
R3UYNOD8YY2X2R,"very cute, neither had holes and they stayed inflated for weeks!"
R3UYNOD8YY2X2R,great buy!
R2W7YKNVMYOYS2,it was good
R2LPMLU7LYHEIH,it charges the helicopter in about half an an hour.
R2LPMLU7LYHEIH,and dont need to use the computer to do it.
R2LPMLU7LYHEIH,great product for the money.
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,these d6 are some of the best you can buy on the market.
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,"i know its a might sound a bit funny talking about features of a six sided die, but youd be surprised what good dice can do for your games!"
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,"these die are rounded on the edges, which means that when you roll your dice, they dont just drop and stop."
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,"theyll tumble quite nicely for a few seconds, even spin sometimes!"
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,"this enhances the randomness of rolls, in my opinion."
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,the other nice feature i like is that the numbers pips are all belowcounter sunk.
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,theres no need to worry about paint nodules or puffy fill.
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,chessex makes these to a standard of quality that you wont get from cheaper die manufacturers.
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,"and lastly, theyre very well weighted."
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,ive never had a die from chessex where ive questioned the weightbalanceprecision of the die.specific to this product i chose the graycopper combination to match a 7die set that i bought.
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,"however, chessex has many different die color and pip combinations."
R1SXKMAJDQ1GCE,the sky is the limit with chessex!
R34526JWJ68KXH,i bought it for my niece for her birthday and she absolutely loves it!
R2APFG49YI2WYI,cool!

R3ENPK8EFYXKU7,lol super over priced
R3LLRT6394JEP1,this is the best gift i ever gave to my young granddaughter.
R3LLRT6394JEP1,"she adores it, never goes to bed without it."
R3LLRT6394JEP1,"if you want to give a gift that the parents will love, this is it."
R3LLRT6394JEP1,"it can be programmed to include the childs name, favorite foods, and colors."
R3LLRT6394JEP1,really a great gift.
RV56MLZ2ZRXR8,these are really nice balloons for the price.
R1HWU0U8P1TX7K,lots of fun
R27K6P8RBDHE78,a highly underrated card.
R27K6P8RBDHE78,it lets your opponent draw 1 card but stops your opponents key card effects from activating.
R27K6P8RBDHE78,if used properly it can absolutely seal a game for you.
R27K6P8RBDHE78,i would especially recommend pairing this with dark law so your opponent also loses a card after drawing off its effect.
R22TKDHJPYYRLN,love it
R1G7ZC7BSFN3OR,package was clearly opened with four shopkins replaced.
R1G7ZC7BSFN3OR,"there was a long hair stuck inside of the package and there were two of the same ""discolored"" character shoved into a spot that was clearly not molded for those characters."
R2BJZ1TGT82H0G,ive wanted this figure since she came out.
R2BJZ1TGT82H0G,glad i now have her in my collection.
R2K813HC7UAKDO,"guys this may or may not be a bootleg, i have no proof, but real figures have some sort of ""official japan produce"" but this does not."
RCO2Y5E9XGRGL,very nice
R3O1V8TRAJN0CC,super cheaply made but worked great for decorating my sons cake.
R1DEQI8JFD5AIO,"doesnt work so well, sometimes the animal sounds are incorrect."
R1DEQI8JFD5AIO,and this seems to be a very small mini version.
RJMO9Q411DS0U,adorable!
RJMO9Q411DS0U,"the mechanics are a bit loud, but love this!"
R8T8734QDB2AR,"so, i love this model, its great!"
R8T8734QDB2AR,"looks great, moves well, very detailed and poseable!"
R8T8734QDB2AR,"however, i constructed mine on my floor."
R8T8734QDB2AR,"i live in a dorm room, with no table and dark carpet."
R8T8734QDB2AR,"the piece was j10, which is very small, and as ive learned, is used to connect the railgun to the actual body."
R8T8734QDB2AR,"well, i popped it early on accident, and now it has just disappeared."
R8T8734QDB2AR,"so i have a railgun, and a metal gear, and no way to put them together."
R8T8734QDB2AR,so..... what now?
R8T8734QDB2AR,"i cant contact the maker to get that part, so i guess i have metal gear chicken now."
R8T8734QDB2AR,"oh well, still cool!"
R3OJU0RZX34T6X,used in the tub about 3 times.
R3OJU0RZX34T6X,water got into it and it never played again.
R3OJU0RZX34T6X,"sad, because it was cute and the kids loved it...3x"
R18V7BYP6ACZYJ,given as a gift
R1HIL8A57EZNXO,"some rough spots under the chin but other than that, they are well made."
R1I57V3Y6FY416,the animals are very cute but 2 of the 5 i received had holes so leaked air and wouldnt stay inflated.
R1KOFIVP7BMHQY,not very sturdy and awkward to get into.
R1KOFIVP7BMHQY,at 56 head hits the bar when sitting in it but i cut a noodle and slipped it on and it was much better.
R1KOFIVP7BMHQY,"if i get a couple years out of it, i guess its ok."
R17SYKGUBT35QP,love this!
R17SYKGUBT35QP,really added personality to my macbook air.

RB9EVM1VB25V6,"we got this game for our 4 year old granddaughter, who is about to start preschool."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"she has a number of other leapfrog items, including the pad and reader, and loves those."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"this seemed like a logical extension, especially since her mother loves the xbox games."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"she was over the moon to get this game, and thats with it in the box.for the first time with a console game, she can play it."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,by herself.
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"thats a big deal when you are the shortest member of the family, it seems."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"the games are engaging, although she is quickly forming favorites within the selection."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,she is apparently falling in love with olaf.
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"since she already recognizes numbers, the game is within her grasp without undue effort."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"learning to operate the console and controller was a bit of a challenge at first, but the young princess of cell phones, tablets, and remotes soon mastered that too.the games are educational, which satisfies her parents and grandparents as to their merit and justifies their expense."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"she loves the graphics, and isnt overly critical about their quality."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"at 4, shes also not a literary critic, so cheesy storylines dont faze her at all."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,this isnt a game designed for adults or teensits designed for the preschool to primary age group.the game enthralls her now.
RB9EVM1VB25V6,how long the game will continue to do so is still an unknown.
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"typically, if it follows the pattern with games she has played on our kindles, she will use it for 69 months, then outgrow it."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"if she masters all of the skills it is attempting to teach, it will have delivered more than our moneys worth."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"if she has enough fun to even get her to master half of those skills, the same thing is true.the bottom line is that if she is happy, were all happy."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,"if shes happy and learning too, were ecstatic."
RB9EVM1VB25V6,i really dont see any negatives to this game.
R27WHA1ECGU5EO,seems to be the same.
R27WHA1ECGU5EO,"my daughter received as a gift but i guess i should be grateful hers was missing parts, the hair dye to go with the stampers."
R27WHA1ECGU5EO,she had fun with it for a brief moment but i dont think she will play with it again.
R126CAA33LH5OE,my daughter has a lovehate relationship with this toy and so do we.
R126CAA33LH5OE,"its a really cool castle, and the twilight sparkle that comes with it is different from others that she has had."
R126CAA33LH5OE,"she loves the hidden keys and how they open up the dresser, etc."
R126CAA33LH5OE,the frustration comes from how easily it falls apart and how hard it is to get put together.
R126CAA33LH5OE,"it is a definite ""adult assembly required"" toy... and if it gets tipped over, or say for instance your clumsy yellow lab makes a failed attempt to leap over it... the pieces come apart."
R126CAA33LH5OE,"also, the assembly instructions are those lovely nonverbal type that show pictures, and arent always the clearest."
R126CAA33LH5OE,"even during normal, relatively gently play it was nearly impossible to keep the cardboard backdrop parts in place."
R126CAA33LH5OE,to remedy this we used superglue.
R126CAA33LH5OE,"it has helped, but it definitely wasnt in the assembly instructions to glue the snot out of every possible joint so that the toy would stay together."
R126CAA33LH5OE,would i buy it again?
R126CAA33LH5OE,"probably, if it was on sale.... but not for the price we paid."
RM3T2EIZZVF4O,love this toy... does all what is described and great starter if you want to spend more into the real deal quadcopters.
R3QEJR4EU34DSQ,love this fun toy!
R3JDQVPKI21KJU,this thing barely makes it off the ground.

RCML61QPX1EUC,"we got a pencil, bubbles, tattoos, and other random items in the bags with a bit of space left over."
R23WZX4TCS1L8A,half of the glow sticks didnt work most of the orange and red colors.
R23WZX4TCS1L8A,"the rest were okay, but nothing i couldnt have picked up at the dollar store.wouldnt buy again."

R3MF707SQIGHDN,he loved them!
R180AN9SIWLK7V,my 5 year old is obsessed with firetrucks.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,this one is absolutely wonderful in the design and how many things my son can do with it.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,the truck is lightweight which is great since my son is on the smaller side.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,it is extremely well made for as light as it is.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,the lights and sounds are one of the best features about this truck.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,the lights are bright and colorful and really catch my sons attention.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,the sirens are loud but not so loud they are obnoxious as some toys we have are.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,i like that it has the ladders that he can play with.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,i was surprised that the price was not higher for a toy that clearly is designed incredibly well.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,my son has even had to take this to bed with him at night so i would say that this is a winner in his book.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,i also think its a winner because the noise level is parent approved!
R180AN9SIWLK7V,this really brings out his imagination and gets him away from his tablet.
R180AN9SIWLK7V,i highly recommend this for anyone looking for a gift that can inspire and encourage a childs imaginative play.i received this free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

R3I1J410WDVWDT,they are great for my kids but also for me as i like to color in adult coloring books.
R3I1J410WDVWDT,"they write smoothly but since they are so short, it hurts my hand a little bit when im coloring for a long time because the top of the pencil digs into my palm."
R3I1J410WDVWDT,i would go with the long ones if youre a grown up but these are great for the kids.
R3I1J410WDVWDT,they love all the colors.
R3I1J410WDVWDT,"the points do tend to break when you sharpen them sometimes and since theh pencils are so short, ive had to already throw a few colors out because theres nothing left to sharpen and ive barely gotten to use the color."
R3I1J410WDVWDT,"but, theres so many colors it doesnt matter too much."
R3I1J410WDVWDT,its just easier for the kids to color with which is important to me.

R2HW4H9ZWYNW0G,"i have been wanting to double sleeve my standard size playing cards mostly my magic tcg game cards for a while now i used to double sleeve my yugioh ones all the time just to protect my investment in the cards and to play them without worrying about damage, we all know the feeling of cards sliding out of the top of the sleeves!"

R2HW4H9ZWYNW0G,"the fit magic, force of will, and pokemon cards almost perfect some sleeves are a little bigger or smaller then the others but nothing huge."
R2HW4H9ZWYNW0G,the ultra pro ones would bow the cards and were so tight that i personally bent some of my cards just trying to get them on!
R2HW4H9ZWYNW0G,this was enough to double sleeve 3 deck they do fit inside ultra pro standard sleeves very well and i plan on getting more for all my decks!

RFSLTBF0LSWEL,i was excited to get to try this product.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,my girls love to help me cook and bake and who doesnt love chocolate?
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,the product advertises that there is not microwave or heat involved to melt the chocolate.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,what?
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,i was skeptical on how well this process would work.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,"the cool baker chocolate maker came in a box with several parts but it easily snapped together, no hassle or problems."
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,my girls where eager to start.we only had semi sweet chocolate chips in the house and my kids could not wait a few days until i could go to the grocery and buy other varieties as no chocolate in included in the set.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,not a big deal we can make it with only one flavor.the key to the &34no microwave&34 claim is a bowl that you put hot tap water in the bottom of and the chocolate chips sit on top of the dish and the heat from the water is supposed to melt the chocolate.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,the instructions state 510 minutes.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,i got my water the hottest it goes which isnt that hot.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,we have the water heater turned to a moderate heat to eliminate the scalding risk put the chocolate in.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,and waited.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,and waited.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,stirred.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,and waited.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,this was not an easy waiting period for my eager almost 7 and 5 year old.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,"after 8 minutes, not much melted."
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,"so i had to put the chococlate in a microwave safe bowl and microwave for a minute to melt it quicker and easier.so the whole point of this product, to melt chocolate without microwave or outside heat source, did not work for us."
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,this is my only complaint.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,"maybe if our water heater was set to a much higher temperature it would have been more successful.the rest of the process putting the chocolate in the molds, spinning, freezing, and popping out to eat all worked very well.the &34tools&34 are a little chintzy."
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,the &34paint brush&34 tool worked ok. regardless my kids had fun making their own chocolate and eating it.
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,"my oldest begged to take a piece to school to eat after lunch, and to show off to her friends.we had fun overall."
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,"butsince the whole &34no microwave&34 thing didnt work for us, we probably could have just bought molds from someplace and had the same result.i was given this product from bzzagent to test."
RFSLTBF0LSWEL,but my review is my own.
R27A0A7U3CGU3M,may have received a different cube.
R27A0A7U3CGU3M,"colors arent as bright as the pictures show and other ""bright"" cubes i already have."
R27A0A7U3CGU3M,the first time i scrambled it a subcube popped out.
R27A0A7U3CGU3M,it snapped back in easily.
R27A0A7U3CGU3M,im now more careful and move it slower.
R27A0A7U3CGU3M,sometimes subcubes to rub against each other and feel like they will pop out.
R27A0A7U3CGU3M,it doesnt move as easily as the other cubes from the same manufacturer.
R27A0A7U3CGU3M,"however, i am enjoying it and will not return it based on these small difficulties."
REWQ3594RLKTE,"""green toys"" brand of toys are great."
REWQ3594RLKTE,"bought this one for my youngest grandson,  now 3. he loves playing with it."
REWQ3594RLKTE,"as for myself, and his parents, we are completely satisfied as well, because of the great quality, etc."
R1S65F62RHVYKA,i got this to help keep my 2 year olds busy while i homeschool my older children.
R1S65F62RHVYKA,they have really enjoyed it so far!
R1S65F62RHVYKA,"they have to work to put the peg in the hole, which is helping fine motor control."
R1S65F62RHVYKA,we have used the pegs to work on colors and sorting too.
R1S65F62RHVYKA,"i do wish there were a few more pegs in the set, as they do like to stack them."
R1S65F62RHVYKA,glad i purchased!
R1O9KUL198Q9HQ,very pretty colors and lots of fun pieces.
R1O9KUL198Q9HQ,"although the plastic was a bit flimsy, the vaccination shot piece didnt slide in and out smoothly and one of the pieces came broken."
R1O9KUL198Q9HQ,i ended up giving it away and keeping another doctor set that was sturdier.
R1O9KUL198Q9HQ,"the best part was, that whoever packaged it was very sweet in adding a very pretty set of glittery disney princess stickers!"
R15CIOILDK8JMR,absolutely lovely.
R15CIOILDK8JMR,"my one year old loves her, and i dont mind looking at it unlike most of the weird things they market for children."
R15CIOILDK8JMR,"very striking, lovely doll."
R2UCUJA8GZSBWY,very nice just like they said.
RK7KN7SL4EF2P,my grandson loved it.
R2EK5XJC71NJA,its way to big for a 3 year old but still very good item
RI9BUVOL5MAX8,great
R1BXPGXL2N1VJL,just what i needed.
R1PE5LTSM0VNIK,perfect and no problems.
R2GAZ5W8DR8OUQ,"these were great, i used it for my nephews party."

R2LMS3TPHAQ4AX,met needs
R105LZ4WKEWN8M,reminds me of childhood
R1BV1F3KBFBXMB,i spray painted this blue and gave as a gift for a toilet paper holder.
R1BV1F3KBFBXMB,its neck was the perfect length!
R3TNFAPS7DBU5Z,fun little toy.
R3TNFAPS7DBU5Z,the sounds are pretty generic but my kid loves it.
R3TNFAPS7DBU5Z,itll make a great addition to his halloween costume.
R4Q9UNFFDIZ88,"didnt balance even the first 2 charges, but after the third it works great, great run time for my rusty."
R4Q9UNFFDIZ88,only prob is the measurements are a little off its a bit longer and wider but thinner than listed.
R4Q9UNFFDIZ88,nothing some tiedowns and tape wont fix though.
R4Q9UNFFDIZ88,great for the price!
R4Q9UNFFDIZ88,!
R3VTIKYBFO5RKC,a nice case for the hubsan.
RFDUM223W5FYI,good size and quality for a 3 year old.
RFDUM223W5FYI,"but, missing one of the puzzles entirely."
R3KTUTDT3MRGCG,a must.
R13RQK9MPWNUS1,this was all the rage at the office christmas party... everyone was fighting for this fun gift!
R13RQK9MPWNUS1,"well made toy, not cheap and flimsy."
R1F2I723WRK5QV,bought this for my cats as all the ones for cats are super small.
R1F2I723WRK5QV,"im not sure where all these tiny cats are that they sell cat tubes for, but its a little ridiculous."
R1F2I723WRK5QV,"they love it!, with clips you can bend it into different shapes or connect the tunnels."
R1F2I723WRK5QV,"its huge, so make sure you have room for it, but the cats love to chase each other through it at high speed."
R3FTCCRB4FMVRR,this puzzle is very fun and beautiful!
R2WVZITIRCLWK7,gave as a birthday present for 8 year old grandson.
R2WVZITIRCLWK7,he is totally into baseball right now.

R2WVZITIRCLWK7,they say it is awesome!
R2WVZITIRCLWK7,!
R2MBS09I1GRJ5P,it is the pose as te colorful one... but the black suite and the skills are so cool.
R4Z1M3GSKZYWL,these look so real that it is hard to tell the real eggs from the fake.
R4Z1M3GSKZYWL,so much less than at the feed store.
R305ANYA5AP5KX,great
R4VDGXN5UOT4E,great but expensive when you add postage.
R2PYHOLQTOJNYZ,its just what i expected and my granddaughter loves it!
R3PXSFKRQFTUAN,great price.
R3PXSFKRQFTUAN,agd loves her!
R3PXSFKRQFTUAN,thanks for sharing nellie with us!
R2KWYVPS3ESFBN,is that a typo...$753.00 for a game that should cost $20.00 or less????
R2KWYVPS3ESFBN,?
R2XNZ16HNT5YLP,this raccoon puppet is so soft that i want to snuggle it myself.
R2XNZ16HNT5YLP,i bought it to use in my classroom with asinb005vsizyo the kissing hand book.
R2XNZ16HNT5YLP,i paired it with a cute stuffed owl and my preschoolers love it.
R2XNZ16HNT5YLP,this is a great way to bring the story to life for them and allow them to act out their feelings about their first day of school just like chester in the story.the puppet feels like a good quality and seems like it will last.
RRMNI0YLUZNTB,"havent had to use any of these spares yet but im glad to have them, just in case."
RJ4YTJNF8MOHD,love it
R1IC5MTGOIO89K,this container was more than i expected.

R2VK16C93JPJPU,no surprise and it works great.
R1VWVELGL70PPN,exactly as presented  very happy.
R15LU1ULH96YK3,super cute and the owl balloon was big!
R15LU1ULH96YK3,they held up great and looked sooo cute at the shower.
R3O5XMXM04DDQX,k
R38ILWABFELH41,these toy are neat because they crawl around the floor and you can interchange their shells.
R38ILWABFELH41,they are just ok because the feetclaws easily come off and the shell snap broke.
R38ILWABFELH41,they are not made for any child under 5.
R2GC43BYQFF2N,it is a wonderful game.
R2GC43BYQFF2N,at first the rules may scare you a little bit but after 2 rounds you get the hang of it and everything becomes simple.
R2GC43BYQFF2N,it has a wellbalanced mechanic.
R2GC43BYQFF2N,the only reason im giving 4 stars is it is the highest point for me.
R2GC43BYQFF2N,dont give anything 5 star.
R2GC43BYQFF2N,nothing can be perfect
R22E1WDE77NBOR,"my children liked it, it is nice toy to have for your children"
R3679OPCPCMRZF,amazing!!!
R3679OPCPCMRZF,great buy for a little girl.
R3679OPCPCMRZF,her brother chased her around and stole it trying to open it and she finally felt like she had something of her own.
R3679OPCPCMRZF,was so happy to give her a gift she loved so much.
R2I4CK3E39CRV6,"i bought this for my granddaughter last year at the age of 1, she is now 2 and still plays with it, she just loves it."
R2I4CK3E39CRV6,great product.
RK1RE6FWLTL5E,"arrived on time and looked great, however the air pressure needed to inflate the mallet forces the valves open so that it slowly deflates."
RK1RE6FWLTL5E,it was fine for a onetime use but would not recommend for anything more than that.
R192RWAU6O1L1C,cute!
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"my 3 year old loves this game, and it is very cute, but pretty minimal compared to the other disney based leapfrog games that i have seen, considering the price under $12, which is pretty low for a licensed character game from leapfrog, though i feel it was a good deal and worth purchasing."
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,i suppose if there were more activities within the game i.e.
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"like the amazing jake game which has tons to do, it would run more like $25, so its nice there is a less expensive option out there!"
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"my kiddo probably couldve managed this one at 2 relatively easily with some initial ""training,"" as gameplay is pretty simple."
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,the free app on disney juniors website is pretty similar.
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"i probably wouldnt bother for over 4 years old if your child is of average or over cognitive ability, as it would probably start to become just too easy."
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"at 3 12, this game isnt really a challenge for my girl, but she enjoys playing it especially as she has gotten more into doc mcstuffins recently, and can play it independently for fun without frustration because it is simple."
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"she is in the phase of playing doctor with her toys, so she enjoys that, and while, at 3, i wouldnt say she is learning a ton of new things with this game, she is at least ""practicing"" important skills though mostly social, not particularly academic ones when playing this game."
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"the one thing i do really like and feel if notable, is that she can practice her fine motor skills in a prewriting manner when stitching up the toys without undue aggravation."
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"if you go ""offcourse"" when following the line which does seem to increase incrementally in difficulty, it doesnt make you start completely over, and is pretty forgiving, unlike the letter tracing in her pet pals game."
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"that one drives us both crazy, as even i struggle with that one and i dont have dexterity problems and have been writing for 35years!."
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"for a toddlerpreschooler, that particular aspect of that other game drives me nuts, as it causes all matter of frustration, and this one is much more realistic and tolerable for a child who has known their alphabet since 1, but lacks the fine motor abilities to trace various lines with utter perfection!"
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,this game handles that aspect quite well.
RR52QLOY5ZYGU,"overall, for the price, a great game for the under 5 set who loves the doc character and enjoys playing doctor."
R1JO9LBA3SG3OW,nice toy.
R1JO9LBA3SG3OW,my son was very pleased!
RS6D68PMC2LZD,"a little bigger than anticpated, but that is a good thing."
RS6D68PMC2LZD,"lots of room, and well built."

RS6D68PMC2LZD,i am very pleased with this product.

RUVUOISCZN74N,this is a really great game with a high replay value.
R13LZYS62Z69UH,super cute true to size
RHTP2E3XI03ZO,super fun party game that is very easy to pick up.
RHTP2E3XI03ZO,"it plays like poker, in a sense, with the bluffing and calling aspect, and plays fast enough to be able to play multiple games in a decent time frame.a must for any tabletop gamer!"
R3AM63809BU0YF,didnt realize how thin and small it was.
R3GWDV8PJ9W7O6,"settlers of catan is a great game on its own, but adding this expansion has allowed us to keep it fresh and change it up a bit."
R3GWDV8PJ9W7O6,our favorite part of this expansion is fishermen of catan.
R3GWDV8PJ9W7O6,we play so often that we just leave it out on one of our tables.
R3GWDV8PJ9W7O6,"it requires some strategy, but it is not as infuriating as monopoly."
R3GWDV8PJ9W7O6,it is really a shame more people havent heard of this game.
R3GWDV8PJ9W7O6,definitely worth buying.
R2YYHI35MF9CNF,loved it.
R2YYHI35MF9CNF,much nicer than i thought it would be.
R2YYHI35MF9CNF,very pleased.
R3RTRPIXKATU2D,"perfect, just added it to my collection!"

R1JJMRCPCBG32R,pretty challenging and great looking tie fighter
R35HHC861BQZ2J,"initial cube that i received was defective since the center pieces kept falling and after adjusting tension, i could not do corner cuts."
R35HHC861BQZ2J,wrote to newisland and they promptly followed up with me and sent me another cube.
R35HHC861BQZ2J,they even let me keep the old cube and not return it.
R35HHC861BQZ2J,the new cube is perfect as i expected.
R35HHC861BQZ2J,"sharp corner cuts, no loose center pieces."
R35HHC861BQZ2J,"well packaged, nice pouch and good cube material."

R1HWWUHA4BK5NU,"this was a hit with my five year old right out of the box.yes, it is loud."
R1HWWUHA4BK5NU,"however, really, all of my childrens toys are loud."
R1HWWUHA4BK5NU,"this was not really a stand out in that department.what i really loved that it was intuitive to use and my daughter was able to use it, right away, with no help from me."
R1HWWUHA4BK5NU,"as a matter of fact, she refused any help from me.some have complained that the graphics are not fancy enough, but in my mind this is a plus."
R1HWWUHA4BK5NU,"i see the graphics as almost having a &34retro&34 feel.this toy is simple to use, with no parts to lose and it levels automatically."
R1HWWUHA4BK5NU,a total win in my book!disclosure i was given this toy to facilitate my review.
R1HWWUHA4BK5NU,"however, all opinions are my own."
R1XLOBAIQ97DXQ,the tiara came looking used and quite beat up.
R1XLOBAIQ97DXQ,"the prongs on the sides are also uneven, pretty poor quality."
R2IVEXQSJFYN7U,everything was great.

R1QIX3PH529WHY,he plays with it for hours on end.. however its only been a couple week and the pieces started peeling!
R1QIX3PH529WHY,wish it was a little better made.
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,"we bought bianca kitty for our daughter, who we named bianca before seeing this kitty."
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,she is 3 and a half morhs old so she does not really react to toys and objects much yet.
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,"however, when we showed her this kitty, smiles erupted and lil babylike laughs came bubbling forth!"
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,we have never seen her react to any object the way she reacted to her very own bianca...it was amazing!this kitty is exactly as described...minus the whiskers shown.
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,other reviewers have griped about the missing whiskers but we love the fact that there are none.
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,"here is why...they cant be pulled off or get ratty looking and with no whiskers, we dont have to worry about her poking herself in the eye with stiff whiskers...so we like the no whiskers kitty!"
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,others complained about the &34freakishly long&34 tail.
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,"we love it and think it is adorable...it also provides an easy point for little hands to grab on to and to drag it around, the way any favorite stuffie is lovingly dragged around by an adoring child.this kitty is so fluffy and soft!"
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,"when we wash it, we will be placing it a pillowcase before throwing it in a cold water gentle cycle to dry on low heat, possibly with a tennis ball to knock out any lumps that want to form.this is a wonderful addition to any stuffie collection and is beautiful and lovable...we are ordering another one to keep as a back up!"
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,"it is well worth the 35 dollar price tag and i would gladly pay it again to keep that beautiful gummy, toothless smile on our daughters face!"
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,love it!!
R29NXA6R6DPWNI,!

RRC5KO4ABZVLH,i have cah 16 600 and crabs against 14 448 which equals 1048 minus the blank cards.
RRC5KO4ABZVLH,"in the case i can fit cah 16 and crabs against all the whites, but the black cards dont fit."

R3PXJGFZP4HKY6,!
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,i have to give this ogobild animate it kit a mixed review.
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,i have a 9 year old grandson who has been making videos on his own for as long as he knew such a thing existed.
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,he mostly uses lego backgrounds and figures for his movies.
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,"we have also worked with &34flip books&34 in the past, so he grasps the concept of how a movie is actually created framebyframe."
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,so i was excited to present this kit to my grandson when it arrived.his reaction was less than spectacular.
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,"first, he wanted nothing to do with the &34characters&34 that come with the kit."
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,he thought they were too babyish.
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,so we got out his lego figures and backgrounds to replace the characters that come with the kit.
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,we downloaded and installed the software.
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,"and then we both just kind of stared at the screen for awhile... what next?although hes used movie editing software before, this software was more difficult to figure out, and there is, of course, no paper manual to sit and read while you try things out."
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,dear manufacturers bring back paper manuals!
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,"we set up a 2nd computer so he could read the manual online while working with the software, and that helped."
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,"he got his background and lego men all set up  and then had to deal with the camera repeatedly falling over  sometimes even crashing into his &34scene&34 which, of course, ruined everything.it took an entire afternoon  and i mean a good 45 hours  to make a relatively quick &34movie&34."
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,my grandson felt he could have done it far quicker with his regular video editing software.the frustration level for a 9 year old  and a pretty tech savvy 9 year old at that  was pretty high.
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,"higher still for the grandmother who wasnt much help.i guess if he had a tech savvy parent sitting next to him to walk him through this, he might have enjoyed it more."
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,"but as an &34out of the box&34, kidfriendly kit?"
R1P2C1XNBQG91A,not so much.
R2GJ4WJVH2BVY8,my 4 year old grandson loves all the equipment.
R2GJ4WJVH2BVY8,you might want to space out when you give your child the individual tools.
R2GJ4WJVH2BVY8,"they are awesome, but a lot at one time."
R2GJ4WJVH2BVY8,lots of fun work to do!
R32MCK36FZ8DV8,im going to be biased here!
R32MCK36FZ8DV8,i love lego especially star wars lego!
R32MCK36FZ8DV8,it was a lot of fun to build with the kiddo!
R32MCK36FZ8DV8,"price is good not too expensive it was great build took a while, and when paired with the small ship it looked and felt great solid!!"
R32MCK36FZ8DV8,note if its usually classic or a collectors buy 2 keep 1 and play with the other  sell it later... im sure you guys know all this already.
R1X4RD8HJCG98Z,schleich does it again!
R1X4RD8HJCG98Z,"if you buy this set as a gift for a lover of prehistoric creatures, you will very likely be met with huge smiles and much gratitude.though the set is made in china, which would ordinarily make me take off a star, these toys are up to schleichs usual high standards for quality and detail."
R1X4RD8HJCG98Z,"the three figures are not proportionate to their prehistoric counterparts actual relative sizes, but thats unlikely to bother most who play with the set."
R1X4RD8HJCG98Z,the articulated jaws on the velociraptor and carnotaurus really add a lot of fun and play value.i really like that the volcano mat can be used in open form as a landscape or in zipped form as a volcano and carrying case.
R1X4RD8HJCG98Z,"in the storage form, theres plenty of room for a few more similarly sized toys, should one want to include them.if you dont care about the mat, you can buy each of the figures in this set separately for a lower price.absolutely fantastic set!"
R26H571QTJFL0J,my nephew loves all lego.
R26H571QTJFL0J,he really likes this
R1F5OOLFLZT33U,my 6 year old daughter loves this book so much we have actually bought two.
R1F5OOLFLZT33U,it has several stencils for clothing and accessories.
R1F5OOLFLZT33U,it really allows the child to get creative with color and design.
R1F5OOLFLZT33U,in addition there are also stickers.
R1F5OOLFLZT33U,"for the child who loves to create and color, you cant go wrong."
R1F5OOLFLZT33U,"i would give it 5 stars but i feel like the crayon design isnt the greatest in terms of stability but otherwise, great fun!!"
R1F5OOLFLZT33U,im sure well by another one once she goes through the 2nd.
R3O92C6KZ541J2,love it

R2Y577U0XA6RZX,love the cards but the box they come in is too small to store the cards so that you can see the letters picture like a card catalog.
R2Y577U0XA6RZX,i recieved mine and was eager to get them organized.
R2Y577U0XA6RZX,it didnt take long for me to be disappointed.

R1BR5858ZE8QTD,"one leg broke within a day of receiving it  the locking device bent and the table can no longer close properly  weve owned a few of these tables before, and while they are not the highest quality, we never had a problem like this so soon  hoping amazon will replace it, well see"
R20DD6FZNUIH4D,"prob best return on a $13 investment on a pool toy ever...this is not a highend, last forever type of game...its plastic and will easily get thrashed not that mine did...it survived a 12 year olds bday party."
R20DD6FZNUIH4D,"but that being said, ill spend $13 and buy this again and again every year or every time i need it because everybody had so much fun playing.really...you cant go wrong."

RD3H5P70Z0Z7E,"some of these broke off while hanging, after a 2 year old tugged on it."
RD3H5P70Z0Z7E,broke right in the twisty hanger thing.
RD3H5P70Z0Z7E,"overpriced, and tiny."
RD3H5P70Z0Z7E,"the bottom pieces on 23 inches, max."
RD3H5P70Z0Z7E,barely noticeable at the party.
RD3H5P70Z0Z7E,you would need 50 of them to decorate a 1000 sq ft space and make a dent in the decor.

R2QV27G6IL9EFX,"i was worried about the sturdiness of this doll house as it is made of cardboard, but its definitely durable for a 4 year old with lots of barbies and barbie furniture."
R2QV27G6IL9EFX,"plus, you cant beat the price especially when comparing it to a mattel barbie house."
R3T043S9YEXW9N,works fine.
R3T043S9YEXW9N,"very small, and tested against my multi meter , was spot on."
R1C28JU7QPTOBX,"i only buy from schleich, but when i ordered this item, the actual figurine looks nothing like the photo used."
R1C28JU7QPTOBX,"such as the ears are in different directions, and a few more."
R1C28JU7QPTOBX,i am thinking i may have gotten the wrong item or something.
R1C28JU7QPTOBX,"but because of this, i now have two of the same fawn figurines."
R115CN68VXUGZ6,"just as advertised, the case is very secure, reliable and really asks how anyone can take their done without one..."

R1LBI3SUTNJLF8,these shoes are wonderful.
R1LBI3SUTNJLF8,my two year old loves high heels.
R1LBI3SUTNJLF8,"weve gone through several pairs of the cheap hard plastic ones, but after she slipped a few times and even broke a shoe i was afraid she might get injured by them."
R1LBI3SUTNJLF8,so i set out to find a pair that were sturdier.
R1LBI3SUTNJLF8,i came across these ones and theyre perfect.
R1LBI3SUTNJLF8,theyre quite large and on the heavy side but that doesnt seem to bother her.
R1LBI3SUTNJLF8,theyll definitely last until she grows into them.
R1LBI3SUTNJLF8,for now theyre the perfect dress up shoe for around the house... so perfect we ended up getting another pair in a different pattern for her older sister.
R2XU1GG11CVIQ3,the game description did not indicate that 6 or more players were necessary to make the game enjoyable.

R10OHANJP08G3F,this one is very cute.
R10OHANJP08G3F,it shows the erupting volcano.
R10OHANJP08G3F,"there are lights and sounds, which he really liked."
R10OHANJP08G3F,"he like the zip line, too.one thing i really like about this set is that it can connect to other sets."
R10OHANJP08G3F,"it is great as a stand alone, but you can use other sets and trains with it, which is nice.we didnt have a problem setting it up."
R10OHANJP08G3F,it was easy.
R10OHANJP08G3F,it felt nice and sturdy.

R18JPX48VXPNVT,awesome bags.
R18JPX48VXPNVT,"so far they fit everything i have from yen press, kodansha comics, vertical and viz."

R18JPX48VXPNVT,ill update if they do.

R2EZ9IG3FOY7F8,granddaughter loves this doll.
R2EZ9IG3FOY7F8,shes pretty and the hair is lots of fun.
R179DWT4C80TWG,i really enjoy these toyclass quadcopters and hexacopters.
R179DWT4C80TWG,"ive had a few, and this one is particularly special to me."
R179DWT4C80TWG,"the short version of my assessment would be to buy at least one of these, if not two."
R179DWT4C80TWG,they are cheap and great fun.the prop guard is one of the best designed that ive seen.
R179DWT4C80TWG,"you can bump this thing off the wall, off the ceiling, and it keeps flying with no harm to the quadcopter or to the room itself."
R179DWT4C80TWG,i do like to take the prop guard off when im going to fly outdoors.
R179DWT4C80TWG,"it does fly a little better without the burden.the props themselves are gear driven, which allowed syma to install bigger props and smaller motors."
R179DWT4C80TWG,"those big props can spin more slowly than smaller props, so this quadcopter is not quite as noisy as others in its class.i ended up buying a bunch of spare props but i never needed them."
R179DWT4C80TWG,"the original props still look great, partly because they are high quality, and partly because the prop guard does its job.as quadcopters go, this one is really easy to fly."
R179DWT4C80TWG,this is the one that i teach friends and family how to fly on.
R179DWT4C80TWG,its so forgiving.
R179DWT4C80TWG,"but even once you know what youre doing, you can get it outside into expert mode and really have some fun with it."
R179DWT4C80TWG,"the range isnt awesome, but itll get so small in the distance that youll lose orientation anyway before the range will drop off.my nits?"
R179DWT4C80TWG,the yaw rate is a bit slow.
R179DWT4C80TWG,"id like to see a faster yaw rate, at least in the expert mode."
R179DWT4C80TWG,there is no real battery warning to speak of.
R179DWT4C80TWG,you get a quick flash and then it just drops from the sky.
R179DWT4C80TWG,id like to have a 30 second warning on the batteries so i can land the aircraft responsibly.
R179DWT4C80TWG,"the airframe was made to carry a camera, which this model doesnt have."
R179DWT4C80TWG,id love to have seen this model simply carry a larger battery for longer flight times instead of having an empty camera bay.
R2IUYVCQBI37J7,excellent quality.
R2IUYVCQBI37J7,a couple of reviews mentioned some outfits are too big for the bears the only times i found that to be true are with the long pants.
R2IUYVCQBI37J7,"in that case, just place so that the shirt is properly alined and adjust the bottoms accordingly, rather than covering the bears face."
R2IUYVCQBI37J7,i dont see any reason to knock off stars.
R2IUYVCQBI37J7,"i think these are so much cuter than the melissa and doug versions, and both of my kids really like them one for each to play together!."
R2IUYVCQBI37J7,"also, the bears are the perfect thickness, not chincy and not too chunky either."
R2QC22CE4K449Z,great product and great cause
R3NRIK55GTTUKN,great

R1CXC6BWNBP4DV,we all had a great time with it.
R1CXC6BWNBP4DV,it was awesome how you can drive the car then the helicopter flies out of it.
R1CXC6BWNBP4DV,the only problem was the battery seems to not hold the charge as much the longer we used it but im sure thats fixable.
R1IW2RT354IRS0,these little toys are exactly what i expected!

R1IDFJNTTUEGXM,two big thumbs up!
RV2RFAS8DC4WX,"i will say that out of the 5 hg 1100 endless waltz gundam line up, this is easily my favorite kit because of how much more solid it feels compared to the rest."
RV2RFAS8DC4WX,i was also surprised that he has no problems holding the scimitars because the joint on these old kits arent that good and the weapons are ridiculous.
RV2RFAS8DC4WX,"and to top it off, it comes with that cloak as seen in the movie which just makes him look like hes a part of the crossbone vanguard when its on."

R3N7E42PQQFIRN,she really enjoys coming up with here own story behind the cards.
R3N7E42PQQFIRN,this is often a game she will choose to play over any others when picking one out.

R8NDAENM2QI0G,i was so excited to get this book case because i know this brand very well and i know that they are good quality.
R8NDAENM2QI0G,"the book case is good, same as on the picture."
R8NDAENM2QI0G,the wheels are not turning or turning very very hard.
R8NDAENM2QI0G,im not sure what kind of books supposed to be put in between but all my board books such as a barefoot books are not going inside in between.
R8NDAENM2QI0G,they simply falling on the bottom and not hanging together like on the pic.its ok but not great as i expected to be!
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,we love arts and craft hobbies in our home so when i was offered to try this item from bzzagent we were very excited!
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,i do have to admit knitting isnt my forte so that piqued my interest even more.
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,"when we received it my 9 year old was able to remove it from the box and assemble the &34kitting poles&34  as a side note the poles slide and click into the base of the unit for easy storage.the amount of yarn, the colors and the projects they provide in the box are all very good."
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,as mentioned above the pole store in the unit and there are specific places for the &34tools&34 that come with it.
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,the directions got a little tricky at times.
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,on our first try we had to take it off and start over several times.
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,"it was starting to frustrate me and my daughter, so she wanted to take a break and i started again."
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,"i got it to work meaning i finally was getting the hang of it but my loops were big, uneven and messy  when making the infinity scarf."
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,"could it have been user error i suppose.i havent given up hope yet because i really want to love this thing, and so does my daughter!"
RH0PCXJUMZV0G,"overall, we do love the design and the concept and i will continue to practice and update my review accordingly."
RQO1U2PNMPFFX,henry is pretty underrated and is never featured prominently in any episodes.
RQO1U2PNMPFFX,"so, after a few years of collecting the trains, some of which are snazzier and star in the various episodes, we decided to complete the ""basics"" of our daughters collection with henry and edward."
RQO1U2PNMPFFX,"this is a good little train, and the glowing light is a nice touch."
RQO1U2PNMPFFX,props to henry.
R1084PJAASPVW3,"yes, the pencils are short."

R1GJRYQ2CCFLH0,"my daughter loves this purse, she is almost 2 and loves to take this everywhere she goes."

R334S5B8JERLHT,i had ordered 3 of these items in large.
R334S5B8JERLHT,i received the first large jellycat truffle sheep and it was beautiful.
R334S5B8JERLHT,i ordered another large 1 for my neighbor but when it was received it was smaller.
R334S5B8JERLHT,i ordered another large one and received a small sheep again.
R334S5B8JERLHT,has the size large become smaller.
R334S5B8JERLHT,i was so disappointed.
R3O5VGF1TKVXW4,this broke within 10 minutes.
R3O5VGF1TKVXW4,from the beginning its apparent that the disc a is very awkward and uncomfortable to wind especially for an 7 and 8 yearold.
R3O5VGF1TKVXW4,b the disc doesnt go nearly as far as shown on the package.
R3O5VGF1TKVXW4,b to get it to go farther you have to wind it a tad extra and just when it started to work ok it breaks!
R3O5VGF1TKVXW4,this is the worst investment on a toy ive made in a long time.
R3O5VGF1TKVXW4,$13 down the drain.

R19PPBCWJ7DIVA,"this is a good tool for teaching young ones how to turn pages, spin cogs, dials, etc."
R19PPBCWJ7DIVA,its nice that there are different play areastoys to keep your child engaged interested.
R19PPBCWJ7DIVA,"little ones will get a kick out of using the steering wheel to move the bear around the table.i like that you can keep the legs off so the table can sit directly on the floor which is better for babies, but you can add the legs for toddlers that like to stand."
R247KM04EX2ISG,too big for kids.
R2VA7XVOO178ZM,"my kids love this because it is from the lego movie, but it has got to be the flimsiest lego weve ever built."
R2VA7XVOO178ZM,"the motorcycle is supposed to look like it was built by a &34master builder&34, i.e."
R2VA7XVOO178ZM,a creative kid working from his or her imagination with spare parts found around the room.
R2VA7XVOO178ZM,"and it succeeds at that, but this leads to a motorcycle that falls apart easily.the police car, on the other hand, is really sturdy."
R2VA7XVOO178ZM,i feel like we could send it down the stairs with minimal damage.
R2VA7XVOO178ZM,not that we have tried that!
R3EM61OUNSRZ9T,they were good enough.
R3EM61OUNSRZ9T,"but each color is a diffrent kind or string, and they arent labeled which type is which."

R2I0WQE5D8AOSJ,20 x 27 is a fairly common size but i had to cut quite a bit to make this work.

R21K56MCQK3Q3N,"and her hair is actually blue, but other than that shes great i just added some thermoplastic underneath one of her boots and painted it black."
RMRNB9H3FLZJ3,leapfrog makes great toy and this is another winner from the brand!
RMRNB9H3FLZJ3,"however, i do suggest it for kids younger than kindergarten age."
RMRNB9H3FLZJ3,kids as big as the one pictured will be bored easily by this toy.
RMRNB9H3FLZJ3,it teaches the alphabet and phonics and simple words.
RMRNB9H3FLZJ3,this will definitely give your child an edge over the other preschoolers.
RMRNB9H3FLZJ3,"it is fun to use, also."
RMRNB9H3FLZJ3,"the handles twist and turn, controlling what is on screen, adding another level of engagement."
RMRNB9H3FLZJ3,it is at an excellent price point and would make a wonderful present for a 3 year old.
R1H5PY4W8F3NX8,we have 12 different thinking putties!
R1H5PY4W8F3NX8,this one is one of our favs!
R1H5PY4W8F3NX8,my kids use this to keep their hands busy while i am reading to them for homeschool!
R1H5PY4W8F3NX8,it works wonders!
R1H5PY4W8F3NX8,it really helps them concentrate by keeping their busy hands active.
R2V1LOGU73FOWQ,this complete my aou series thank you.
R30O2VZ4O2P50C,"this is a neat product, but i was under the impression i was going to be getting more than one."
R30O2VZ4O2P50C,"please know if you order this, the quantity is 1. for the quantity, i thought the price was a little high almost $7 and would not have ordered if i realized i was only receiving one wand."
R30O2VZ4O2P50C,"live and learn i guess, but hopefully this will help you know before you order."
RR2AY4523YM9Z,very cute and packaged well
R2NWMIDUQRTCIZ,i love it so cute thx

RY5GHJ8K7UH51,so cute!
RY5GHJ8K7UH51,perfect for kids!
RY5GHJ8K7UH51,i want one for myself!
R3AR2F0H1D2EHX,"i didnt expect that much of this pouch, but the term ""velvet high quality"" is definitely hyperbolic exaggerated."
R3AR2F0H1D2EHX,materials are simple synthetics and not even of higher than average quality.
R3AR2F0H1D2EHX,"seam tape is used to reinforce the single stitched sides doubled at the ends on the interior and the drawstrings are a medium weight nylon weave cord with heat sealed ends knotted together, doublepull style."
R3AR2F0H1D2EHX,"prominent ""easy roller dice co"" logo tag sewn into the seam and visible outside the pouch would have been classier if it was just on the inside."
R3AR2F0H1D2EHX,nonetheless i got two of these small bags to hold a 7die set and a set of d6s separately and am satisfied with the price.
R3AR2F0H1D2EHX,just not high enough quality to feel like a 5star rated product.
R1CF2NCS8ZMSDX,this a a fabulous car.
R1CF2NCS8ZMSDX,"it is very fast, and is superbly detailed for a remotecontrolled car."
R1CF2NCS8ZMSDX,"its also userfriendly, and easy to steer.the car looses connection with the remote at about 57 yards."
R1CF2NCS8ZMSDX,i love this car very fun.
R1BV8A0EOQOEG2,perfect birthdy gift for our 4 year old grandson who loves water play!
R1BV8A0EOQOEG2,!
R3LFI333GOD09D,works great for the mini.
R3LFI333GOD09D,"so far seems more durable than the schilling version it replaced because the schilling broke after 34 too many fallsthrows from restaurant high chairs, etc.."
REJH39HNG7EGV,key does absolutely nothing.
REJH39HNG7EGV,could be me could be the key could be unclear instructions... not worth buying.
REJH39HNG7EGV,"heck, not even worth keeping if somebody gives it to you for free."
REJH39HNG7EGV,"again, it could just be me, but i can make no sense out of the instructions, and messed with the key for an hour before i started to feel like it was a stupid waste of time..."
R325NPMD6XPQFS,ok
R51HHCDWZLAMI,"have wonderful memories of spending weekends coloring this with my sister, bought it for a friend of mine and we did the same, decades later!"
R51HHCDWZLAMI,it is beautiful and creative and fun.
R51HHCDWZLAMI,"the same art you remember, still so much fun finding all the hidden creatures."
RLN0LWJHAE2JW,"i got this teeny plushie for my daughter for her 7th birthday, since she was having a pink paris themed party."
RLN0LWJHAE2JW,she loved it.
RLN0LWJHAE2JW,"i threw it in the bag with her main present, so she has something to remember her party by."
R2K1EJLQAN9N8I,amazing item meet my expectation
R2TSR9XKCETC8M,bright ink colors.
R2TSR9XKCETC8M,great designs!
RMRR7YR45BILI,i got about 200 of these after buying someones collection.
RMRR7YR45BILI,i have gotten a lot of compliments on them using them in drafts and such.
RMRR7YR45BILI,legion sleeves always hold up well in my opinion and shuffle smoothly because of their glossiness.
RMRR7YR45BILI,"if you like matte sleeves choose something else but if you prefer glossy, these are the best."
RMRR7YR45BILI,much smoother edges than ultrapro and no splitting like kmc.
R2S2CHHAWGHE0K,good game.
R2S2CHHAWGHE0K,only negative is that it is sometimes hard to locate the second duplicate card on the board to see both options.
R2TYI4VPXIF5MD,perfect for baby learning to walk
RMDXVXH85KHGO,after i got my first costume from relaxcos i couldnt go anywhere else so i asked them if they could make me a sakura uchiha costume even though it wasnt on amazon and they were so amazing and made me the costume i love relaxcos ill never go to anyone else !
R1AUDGWSZVL5V6,my son enjoyed it
R3R3WIMFEKHGCH,this is a great product.
R3R3WIMFEKHGCH,i received it exactly when i expected to and it was packaged appropriately.
R3DW2XHGL5DMNE,"easy to assemble, works great."
R1DXAGEYX0XW20,"super cute and fun, only thing is, i dont think youre actually supposed to use it."
R1DXAGEYX0XW20,i used it for about 3 months and realized i was ruining the bottom of it.
R1DXAGEYX0XW20,"also, if you fill it up too much, water leaks from the seams."
R1DXAGEYX0XW20,"again, super cute, but not practical for everyday use!"
R2332PA5A2C25T,they did not glow when we activated them.
R2332PA5A2C25T,can you imagine getting ready to crush it in new orleans with these babies only to be let down?
R2332PA5A2C25T,super sad.
R2332PA5A2C25T,we were sad.
R2IF4WV7UQUPIB,it came so fast!
R2IF4WV7UQUPIB,i was really excited to place it with the rat of my sailor moon collection!
RR5SN5D3CN4DE,"very tiny did match size of strawberry shortcake house i bought at same time, seems there is a entire collection that snap into this one but my nice love it"
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,this 200 piece set comes with everything you need to build a trex & triceratops.
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,these are my granddaughters two favorite dinosaurs.
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,the box makes it sound simple  for me it was a bit more challenging.
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,"but, it was worth it!"
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,the laughs we shared and the memories we created are priceless.
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,she had a blast.
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,we put them together as shown in the instructions and then for a few days she took them apart and built all kinds of strange looking creatures.
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,"then she decided she wanted her two favorites back  the second time around was a lot easier and since she wants to keep these guys, we super glued them."
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,"paying special attention to the teeth, horns and hip joints."
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,i would recommend this toy to anyone that has a dino lover in the house  just make sure you are prepared to spend some time helping.
R3AIUQYL7YYIND,have fun!heres a few things i learned make sure you do this in a well lit area do not pop all the pieces out pop them out as you need them keep the instructions handy work on one dinosaur at a time
R2PM1U0U9X5CUP,excellent

RVFOMCZ5QJIDN,"thanks melissa and doug for providing us with elvis, the not so scary lion."
R3PRXMQ62MU4AN,awesome game!
R3PRXMQ62MU4AN,"so fun.you definitely will laugh that your cheeks hurt.this game is unbelievable, everyone,if you need laughter in your life,this is the game to play with family,friends.however not a game for kids under 16."
R3FDFO29NB6XUG,this thing is even bigger in person!!

R3MGUJQFM0H0G5,nice!

R3ISJTAQN12RCA,a birthday gift for my 4 year old grandson.
R3ISJTAQN12RCA,"he now quizzes everyone who visits about where in the world they have been, and then tries to find it on the globe."
R1CC1O95HYBRZ8,purchased these dinosaurs after a trip to a popular childrens museum when my son loved the display dinosaurs.
R1CC1O95HYBRZ8,turns out these are exactly the same.
R1CC1O95HYBRZ8,"they are the ideal size for a toddler to me approx 5"" for the raptor and up to 9"" plus for the larger ones."
R1CC1O95HYBRZ8,"very sturdy, great condition, and all stand up well."
R8M4TBDJA5VD5,my daughter absolutely loves this doll!
R46MHQBERJQ9T,love the game and love the cards.

R4OSCEE53EGCU,item cannot use in singapore
R3DFM1NOP04FSA,we love legos.
R3DFM1NOP04FSA,too a fault.
R3DFM1NOP04FSA,"that said, i am very frustrated with the way that the cool figures are often only available by buying overpriced sets that are otherwise lackluster at best.these chinese knockoffs are actually pretty good as far as minifigures go."
R3DFM1NOP04FSA,they assembled nicely and have been great additions to our collections.
R3DFM1NOP04FSA,"they dont have that lego &34snap&34 when connecting to the real thing, but they dont really need too."
R3DFM1NOP04FSA,the shipping time was about 10 days.
R3DFM1NOP04FSA,i would buy them again.
RXICYX66SOGQT,"the wife loves it, thanks!"
R3T27LTKYH337E,i got this for my 3 yr old and he fits great on it.
R3T27LTKYH337E,but if he makes a sharp turn or if sidewalk is bumpy it will tip.
R3T27LTKYH337E,he has taught himself to be careful but he still falls here and there.i would not recommend this bike to anyone i wish they fix the problem because hes too big for a typical trike.
RKYEYUIAVU81O,great sleeves!
RKYEYUIAVU81O,most of this companys products uses this type!
R2UWW52H9EJKW3,i was offered this dinosaur party pack for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it.
R2UWW52H9EJKW3,i ordered the bundle because i have 4 kids and they would love these.

R1SICXL214TPTC,my 19 month old granddaughter was delighted to discover this at nanas house.
R1SICXL214TPTC,she went all over the house helping me clean.
R1SICXL214TPTC,it is lightweight and easy for her to handle.
R1SICXL214TPTC,"i was disappointed, however, that the light is almost nonexistent and the sound of the motor can barely be heard."
R1SICXL214TPTC,i wont bother adding batteries again to utilize that aspect of the toy.
R34QT1DU30DZ81,this is a great little play kitchen.
R34QT1DU30DZ81,"and, when i say little, i mean it is small enough to take on a road tripa test of a quality playset like this is whether or not it is also fun with the sounds turned off."
R34QT1DU30DZ81,"and, indeed, there are enough little things to do that this kitchen would still be fun if the batteries ran out!all of the foods and cooking utensils fit easily inside the oven, which makes for a painless cleanup time.the songs are fun and catchy, and tots learn complex concepts like fractions and parts of a whole without realizing that they re learning.this toy is also a great value and has an easily giftable price tagi will likely keep it on my list of gifts to get the &34little people&34 in my life!disclosure i was given this toy to facilitate my review."
R34QT1DU30DZ81,"as always, all opinions are my own."
RWSO4MA2F0AFO,these are very nice.

R9LY17KHE90CX,my 7 year old boy and his older brother both loved this  it is a fun project.
R9LY17KHE90CX,"you have to pour the mix before it hardens, so it isnt a leisurely project."
R9LY17KHE90CX,"but, my boys like to move fast anyway."
R9LY17KHE90CX,it is also a little challenging to get the goop out of the containers.
R9LY17KHE90CX,"overall, it was a fun project, i was not disappointed with the purchase and plan to buy for others."
RYVZBTP4R4WAM,my granddaughter loves it and uses it constantly.

R3B21IP2BMEM0T,fantastic would definitely recommend these.
R2F08CN61TJBJP,this product feels at first a little minecraftesque but really isnt once you play it.
R2F08CN61TJBJP,"however, my five year old who loves minecraft actually loves this game as well!"
R2F08CN61TJBJP,he has played it for a long time and never gets bored.
R2F08CN61TJBJP,he loved building up his city and meeting new characters and customizing the buildings.
R2F08CN61TJBJP,"i love that it encourages creativity and is just a very creative game, as well as introduces kids to concepts about the world."
R1YSXA7XQE7N7F,just about the ugliest action figure representation of a very attractive woman ever made.

R3IL29412I3G88,so putting it all together was easy and for my first model its a good way to test the water.
R3IL29412I3G88,what is awful is the paint.
R3IL29412I3G88,it does not spread nicely on the model.
R3IL29412I3G88,it is like a water color paint how it just clumps and gets spread around instead of adhering to the plastic.
R3RENC3R5FX19O,love this girl
RU1B4N6KOHTCB,great product fast shipping

R3A9LMTUYVXLJR,shes happy though so thats good.
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,"i almost gave this review 4 stars because the package was a little ripped when it arrived, and im definitely a collector all my anime figures still have their original packaging, but i loved this product too much to bring it down a full star."
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,the figures arrived on time and in perfect condition.
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,"they are all highly posable and come with a large variety of accessories to equip them with, so be sure to have a place to store the extra pieces i used tupperware."
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,"the only piece i had a hard time with was getting the wings to stick on regular gurren lagann, but after a minute or two of tweaking, i got them to stay pretty well."
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,"one other warning, some of the pieces are quite difficult to exchange they can be a pretty tight fit, so just be careful when posing them."
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,"overall, this was an excellent purchase and saved me a ton of money."
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,theyre the real deal.
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,update 32516 the crescentmoon type yellow ornament on regular gurren laganns head broke off.
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,"it seems a little fragile, so id recommend handling with care."
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,i was able to easily superglue it back on without noticeable signs of breakage.
R1E9FALXUNH7JN,"keep in mind that i have handled these figures multiple times and put them in multiple poses, and this is the only serious problem ive had."
R2HB98U6XEWOVA,my son wants to be a police officer when he gets older so i am always looking for fun police toys.

R2J0HDC334LYNA,"this is a nice looking, solid building for use in fow terrain."
R2J0HDC334LYNA,"the roof, second floor, ground floor, and ground floor extension are separate pieces the tops of the first and second floor have small lips to hold the second floor  roof in place, but they still can be bumped off fairly easily."
R2J0HDC334LYNA,"although the resin feels pretty sturdy and could probably survive a fall to the tabletop andor carpet floor, i still get nervous when my children want to play with the house.i dont like that the windows are solid competing products have cutout windows that add a nice touch to the appearance of the model.my item had some very minor chips around the edges."
R2J0HDC334LYNA,"i found at least one video review on youtube that mentioned the same issue, noting that the chip pieces are not in the box  happened before packaging.the battlefront houses are fairly expensive competitors are doing it a tiny bit nicer without the above minor issues and cheaper."
RL11BM9J6FK8S,its a nice set and love the score pad.
RL11BM9J6FK8S,its pretty basic.
R1Q5K7NCDBOR4E,a classic design is shown on this car.
R36PB1XPEQ9ETK,cest merveilleux!
RSYUEDO80VYDG,not for cats... its too big and tends to intimidate them.
RSYUEDO80VYDG,i suppose it would be ok if you have a large aggressive cat.
R256BKATBC4SGP,the detail on these dice is amazing.
R256BKATBC4SGP,"i have used quite a bit the past few weeks, and the color has stayed perfect."

R2PT0MAGF04BJU,thank you!
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,"i rarely, if ever, post reviews."
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,im a gadget guy and ive bought an embarrassing quantity of worthless andor disappointing gadgets over my lifetime.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,but this little guy is different.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,this thing is everything youd think it would be plus a little.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,im still getting used to it but i was up and zooming around my house within about 45 seconds.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,i was actually chasing my kids around within about 5 minutes.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,its so easy to learn and super intuitive.the only issue ive had so far is that when i get going pretty fast this is outside... not inside it feels like each side of the device starts to wobble  almost as if im telling it to turn ever so slightly but alternating back and forth with each foot.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,im guessing this is just do to my body trying to maintain balance as the device speeds up and im sure ill get used to it over time.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,"but i can very comfortably zoom around and 3mph or so.my wife, my very patient wife, gave me the typical light hearted eye roll when i told her i ordered one of these."
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,but she couldnt help but say that it looked really cool and fun once i started playing with it.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,shes 21 weeks pregnant at the moment so i dont think its wise for her to try it out at this point but she totally wants to.so far the battery life seems impressive.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,i rode it for a solid 45 minutes or so and the battery indicator was still solid green.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,im guessing that it will eventually change to orange or yellow when its getting low and then flash red once its close to dying.some have mentioned that its difficult to mount.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,and i had this issue at first too.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,it seems to want to turn in constant circles while youre mounting it.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,but  ive found if you rotate the platform to be level do this by putting one foot on the device and keeping your other off and pressing forward and back with your foot until its level it will beep and then remain still while you mount it.
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,"so for those having this issue, try that method and see if it helps.in summary  i love the thing."
R2D03PA3HE8FJ4,i cant wait to see how these developevolve over the next year or two.
R1UHP4HRI1D4NM,a

R25PLT6IHUZEB7,helpful teaching aide
R26ZZ4M9ONGYY,great!
R32BOB1LHKHBWL,"the boxes were a nice size, easy and quick to assemble."
R32BOB1LHKHBWL,the only issue i had with them was that there was a dot sized grease like stain on a few of them.
R3RBO5KT4QAH53,i have purchased a lot of stuffed animals for my two kids but this one turned out to be the biggest hit ever.
R3RBO5KT4QAH53,even their friends and other parents that have held it thought it was the best.
R3P20W4LMCOX06,remember matthew 721
R2SGSVO8SCUVBZ,good quality product!
RRO8C1IVZMD6H,"when buying rescue bots there are the larger &34energize&34 ones chase, boulder, bumblebee, optimus, blades."
RRO8C1IVZMD6H,"then there is the rescan line that is smaller in scale blurr, bumblebee motorcycle, optimus monster truck, boulder dump truck, medix, hoist."
RRO8C1IVZMD6H,"the quality of the rescan size isnt as good as the energize bots, a bit more sticky in their movements."
RRO8C1IVZMD6H,knowing this will save you some disappointment in quality and size.my boys love all things rescue bots and love the different sizes for different missions.
RRO8C1IVZMD6H,"if you have the opportunity check these out in stores to see different styles, sizes and prices.the energize bots are easy enough for my 12 yr old."
RRO8C1IVZMD6H,some of the rescan size can frustrate my 12 yr old but my 34 yr old has no problem transforming them.
R16HJKMESQ99FL,these parts lasted longer than the copter.
R16HJKMESQ99FL,didnt use them.
R1FWCXWG8QZUQ0,dont know what people are complaining about.
R1FWCXWG8QZUQ0,the figure isnt a fake my friend has the exact same figure and he actually got it when he was in japan and everything was the exact same.
ROVPS7YGDJPT1,great!
R2MKI5TVORVI99,"i bought this for our daughters 2nd birthday, and it has been a huge hit."
R2MKI5TVORVI99,she loves playing with and has gotten hours of enjoyment out of it already.
R2MKI5TVORVI99,"i havent tried putting the umbrella on yet it currently lives in our carport, but the table is a great height for her and is stable."
R2MKI5TVORVI99,"we originally intended to just use both sides as a water table, fearing the potential mess, but i think we will be getting some sand for one side eventually."
R2MKI5TVORVI99,"it has a decent height divider between the two sides, so maybe the mess wont be too great."
R2MKI5TVORVI99,"my only complaint really is that the table slowly leaks water out, even on the side intended for water its a much faster leak on the side intended for sand."
R2MKI5TVORVI99,"not a huge deal for us, as the table is outside, but if youre utilizing the table inside, you might want to caulk where the legs come up into the table to prevent leakage."
R2MKI5TVORVI99,the lid stays on well when secured with the bungee cords on each end.
R2MKI5TVORVI99,"came with 2 little pails with holes in the bottom about 3 or so inches tall, 2 little boats, and a small shovel."
R2MKI5TVORVI99,"wonderful purchase, would definitely recommend it."
R1N11CER8OF3ZF,perfect.
R1N11CER8OF3ZF,exactly as i ordered and expected.
R18S4IS20NBQ4G,fantastic
RQ14GEX5MZWGA,works well for my cards.
RQ14GEX5MZWGA,i like the carrying strap.
R3VWTMD2BSN9QB,pretty cheaply made.
R3VWTMD2BSN9QB,everything was broken in a matter of days.
R3VWTMD2BSN9QB,not for a toddler my daughter is 3 or a kid who plays roughly with toys.
R3VWTMD2BSN9QB,my daughter was actually pretty gentle with these items as i told her they may break.
R3VWTMD2BSN9QB,not worth the money!
R22BA9PMQJUBRS,this was a great buy and the kids loved them!
R2KQUPAMJ7SLO,my daughter loves it
R3GMFN10ZYY7HQ,its a little low but that hasnt stopped the fun.
R1U0RGUTRFNHZO,"i was a little hesitant to get this, as i read some bad reviews, but we love it!"
R1U0RGUTRFNHZO,my 18 month old uses this several times a day and we couldnt be happier with it.
R1U0RGUTRFNHZO,"great construction, easy enough to put together and easy to climb into."
R1U0RGUTRFNHZO,"chose this one because it folds, but we use it so much, it never gets put away."
R1U0RGUTRFNHZO,highly recommend.
R1Z65FMFTHXOUV,the whole set broke right away.
RFHSS1ARZ9IN9,"i thought it was okay, but when i handed it to my nephew, he freaked out and threw it across the room."
RFHSS1ARZ9IN9,i guess he didnt like the feel of it.
R3J5W8KBE7XDQB,worked great.
R3J5W8KBE7XDQB,quick delivery.
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,"my first quadcopter experience so i dont have anything to compare it too, but what i can say is that it is very durable."
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,"it has endured many crashes indoors and outdoors, including being fully submerged in a swimming pool."
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,i let it dry for a day and it works like nothing happened.
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,that particular crash occurred on a windy day.
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,it is very small which makes it difficult to control in the wind if you are a beginner.
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,"other than that, i learned basic hovering in just a few flights."
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,even started flying and flipping pretty quickly!
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,"standard fly time about 5 mins on low default mode, maybe less on high."
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,charges in 17mins.
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,this little copter is a blast and exceeded my expectations!
R2SMNGNUGML7PC,!
R1Z80NC379ECUC,items are exactly as described.
R1Z80NC379ECUC,my 4yr old grandson loves them.
R1Z80NC379ECUC,easy to handle and not flimsy seller was perfect in description price and delivery
R2ICRPF3GWRG59,i purchased these for my daughters ocean themed birthday party.
R2ICRPF3GWRG59,the guests adults and kids had a fun time scratching off the outer blue coating to reveal the rainbow shading inside.
R2ICRPF3GWRG59,they made a great party craft.
R1CNLURS2I667I,i got this one for 14 dollars instead of the other one for 8 dollars because this had the gold and blood red colour as shown in the picture.
R1CNLURS2I667I,the actual figure does not have the same colour but has the same pale yellow and light red colour.
R1CNLURS2I667I,should have gone for the cheaper option.
R1CNLURS2I667I,the picture is deceiving.
R2IT8GQTH9JRA9,i ordered it for a party that i didnt end up attending.
R2IT8GQTH9JRA9,now i can be a pirate on a moments notice.
R17SQ1TALATGNF,gorgeous horse great qualoti
R2JZEKEMTU5Q3S,"my daughter wanted her own lego set like her older brother, this was a great start."
R2JZEKEMTU5Q3S,"she loves playing with her own ""girl"" legos."
R2JZEKEMTU5Q3S,"decent price, cant beat having its own storage container."
R2JZEKEMTU5Q3S,plenty of storage space for additional sets.
R2ZXNSLJ7825AP,love it
R1BFWEM6ZUM4AR,both my son and i love this backpack!
R1BFWEM6ZUM4AR,"holds a lot, and he is a big avengers fan, so a win win!"
RLD7CJ7GGVNNP,box came torn near the top some pencil tips were broken and some seemed used.
R3HRHS8HFUYQ8C,good
R1PBQWBISQF30J,this was the 3rd birthday gift and was received with a loud squeal of happiness.
R1PBQWBISQF30J,all i can say is hours and hours of creative playtime and it has held up to some pretty tough play.
R1PBQWBISQF30J,i have found him standing on it to reach light switch and reaching for stuff in his closet.
R1PBQWBISQF30J,our little one is a big boy and it has withstood a lot and still looks almost as good as the day we gave it to him.
R1PBQWBISQF30J,"almost, is due to the coloring job he did on the upper parking area."
R1PBQWBISQF30J,if your boy loves cars and trucks then this is a great gift.
R1PBQWBISQF30J,"it is also well made and a good looking piece, nice wood and pretty painted colors."
R1PBQWBISQF30J,nothing cheap and plastic about this toy garage.
R1PBQWBISQF30J,love it!!
R1PBQWBISQF30J,!
R3G9JOHK1UTXTO,my kid loves this tmnt series
R1ZVN76LY4S063,"arrived well, on time and will be great fun at halloween."
R2I7ZKWLZRA52J,my granddaughter loves this.
R2I7ZKWLZRA52J,her mom says she hasnt left it since she put it together for her.
R2I7ZKWLZRA52J,"it is a bit stuffy inside, but my granddaughter doesnt seem to notice"
R1TBKQIEKF0DFA,i bought it for my 4 and 6 year old grandsons because they loved playing with their uncles version from almost 20 years ago.
R1TBKQIEKF0DFA,"they enjoyed it a lot, especially being able to fire off boulders!"
R3MZNZU3L7QEM3,omg get all their puppets!
R3MZNZU3L7QEM3,they are perfectly awesome!
R1FDOK18UQDCZ1,"i didnt expect that much of this pouch, but the term ""velvet high quality"" is definitely hyperbolic exaggerated."
R1FDOK18UQDCZ1,materials are simple synthetics and not even of higher than average quality.
R1FDOK18UQDCZ1,"seam tape is used to reinforce the single stitched sides doubled at the ends on the interior and the drawstrings are a medium weight nylon weave cord with heat sealed ends knotted together, doublepull style."
R1FDOK18UQDCZ1,"prominent ""easy roller dice co"" logo tag sewn into the seam and visible outside the pouch would have been classier if it was just on the inside."
R1FDOK18UQDCZ1,nonetheless i got two of these small bags to hold a 7die set and a set of d6s separately and am satisfied with the price.
R1FDOK18UQDCZ1,just not high enough quality to feel like a 5star rated product.
RRK791BQFGC64,great dress up shoes.
RRK791BQFGC64,have held up well to normal play inside and out.
RRK791BQFGC64,good value.

R1V14FMHW7O4S4,i received this product from bzzagent.
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,free im a mom of three boys.
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,weve bought a ton of toy helicopters over the years.
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,to the point that i stopped buying them because they only last a few weeks.
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,"this one however, has lasted."
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,all my kids from 210 enjoy it.
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,its easy to maneuver and land.
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,"weve hit the blades on things several times, and they are still going strong."
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,"the truck it a very neat feature, so unique and new."
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,my five year old enjoys the truck aspect and my ten year old loves the chopper.
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,my dog barks like a maniac and tries to jump high enough to catch it lol.
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,great fun for everyone.
R1V14FMHW7O4S4,the batteries last a long time too!
RMY1X72VTIIW,"i received this slapdash by baxbo stack and crash game for a discount during a promotion in exchange for my honest reviewthey arrived very quickly and was not damaged.we had a huge group get together this weekend and the kids wanted to try the new game, so what the heck, i let them.the game kept a group of teens busy for hours.i never asked them how it was played i was too busy with the adults, all i know is it must have been fun for them to play it that long."
R85VIPP5G0F3D,terrible material!
R85VIPP5G0F3D,"after using for less than a month, already has mold spots all over it."

RW48JEMMY7P87,great game for any age.
RYY76XJFS6I7K,we got these to give to the children at our wedding along with some pages to color on.
RYY76XJFS6I7K,i thought it was perfect and each kid got hisher own box.
R3KRYH5P9DDVA3,"sadly, my 16monthold girl is not interested in it."
R38BZMD53USJWV,its really small but is made of wood and full of plastic coins.
R38BZMD53USJWV,"we buried in the yard while on vacation and then had the kids accidentally ""find"" a treasure map and then dig this up."
R38BZMD53USJWV,the chest managed to survive the excavation and well be burying it again next summer.
R67Q98684XJKA,this is one of the best economic games on the marked.
R67Q98684XJKA,it gets a bit lengthy with 6 people but if you have a good moderate playing with it is still a great game.
R2VVOC84O57CUL,it isnt solar powered
R34ECV311MIIIR,perfect for baby shower!
R34ECV311MIIIR,this set was all we used for the baby shower with a noahs ark theme.
R34ECV311MIIIR,added great color to the scene and the mother to be got to take them home

RYEXT4V039M2Z,ok
R3KOTU0N96E4KG,same thing happened to me as a previous reviewer.
R3KOTU0N96E4KG,no ejection charge whatsoever for this exact rocket.engine.

R3087YCERCA2V2,as advertised.
R3CNTJB3PZT4K4,ever had an awkward moment at dinner where everyone is silent and just looking at one another?
R3CNTJB3PZT4K4,"well sound the awkward silence alarm, and pull out table topics!"
R3CNTJB3PZT4K4,great thought provoking questions which are great for jumpstarting the conversation after life seems to stall and youre caught with a face full of mac n cheese.
R1KRBIULWRBZR2,this was a gift for my 8 year old grandson.
R1KRBIULWRBZR2,his brother was given a set for his birthday and he liked it so much that he wanted one also.
RQ7EY69HQAIV7,if you know of a kid that loves turtles theyll likely like this one.
RQ7EY69HQAIV7,the kit includes a plastic container that can be filled with water with a lid that can act as a diving platform.while on solid ground it will move with its fins and waddle across a surface.
RQ7EY69HQAIV7,once it gets in water a small propeller built into its hind quarters will push it along while the fins continue to move.
RQ7EY69HQAIV7,the turtle appears to be pretty buoyant and will keep itself on the surface of the water.
RQ7EY69HQAIV7,it can move at a pretty fast pace so its best suited for a bath tub or beach vs. the little bucket it comes with.thats it.
RQ7EY69HQAIV7,pretty simple but a fun little toy for kids that like turtles.
RS6H11PNFYHIC,its a good card for a noncombat damage deck
RJY3Q7W1VQQ9E,very easy to put together.
RJY3Q7W1VQQ9E,i have used it multiple times.
RJY3Q7W1VQQ9E,love it.
R2B2Q02PIJC860,parts of the finish came off.
R2B2Q02PIJC860,not very satisfied.
RXMI94L5TU9SS,this playset basically recreates the main control center from the movie.
RXMI94L5TU9SS,"memory balls roll down a chute like they do in the movie and it comes with a little projector  you put the balls in the projector and they project a memory onto the wall of the screen.projector its a kid projector so dont expect tv quality, its designed for kids to play youre going to need a slightly darkened room so that it projects correctlyset construction its constructed as good as most of these fold up playsets are."
RXMI94L5TU9SS,itll last for a few years if used correctly by a 6  8 year oldfun my kids loved the movie and i do find them playing with the set occasionally.
RXMI94L5TU9SS,its definitely not something that theyll only use once.
RXMI94L5TU9SS,"theyll reuse the toy, provided that they enjoyed the movie which my girls did.what couldve been better i wish they had included at least sadness as another character."
RXMI94L5TU9SS,"you kind of need a few emotions so that they can really get into role playing.overall overall, if your kid loved the movie, this is one of those things that will probably be scarce for the holidays so go ahead and get one before they run out."
RXMI94L5TU9SS,"if your kids havent seen the movie or didnt get into the movie, theyre going to find limited value  because to me the value of the toy is in kids between 6  9 role playing some of the scenes and for that you need a few emotion characters."
R3UARTDL4WPOT9,still sitting in a pile of peices way too complicated to put together!
R22DYPHHD1ZPK4,just right
R24I1XMCTPDTCX,these rafts are very tough and just perfect for tubing down the river or lazy floating!
R24I1XMCTPDTCX,we took them down river where the water was low and the rocks plentiful and no problems at all with scraping the bottom.
R24I1XMCTPDTCX,"we even had an incident where the tube crawled right up onto a large downed tree, onto its pointed branch, and was jammed to the point where they needed an assist to get off the log, and it didnt pop!"
R24I1XMCTPDTCX,"awesome, since it was like 1 hour into a 4 hour float."
R24I1XMCTPDTCX,hahahaha loved these so much i bought a 6 pack so we could give our son 4 for his new camp and a couple more for us!
R3IUE561XBUZLI,hard to make bubbles
R3R1NDLWUXJ2EB,exactly what i wanted at a reasonable price
R1RA7JIFQ7LGPI,very cute!

R1RA7JIFQ7LGPI,i have ordered this item before and been pleased.
R29SCSNJ8JA03,love this car to death recommend it for a kid or child but i would recommend getting superglue for the velcro to the body.
R2GHOWIWDVLN18,the damn thing flew away after come home button was pressed.
R2TCCA5LJXJ71U,my granddaughter loves them!
R2TCCA5LJXJ71U,they match her bunny slippers.
R2TCCA5LJXJ71U,too cute!
R20HHK29561MHW,delivery was a little slow but worth the wait.
RBZK17IX6CWX9,"the table was chipped on the top when we received it, but i dont think its worth the hassle to try to return it."
R150H2KI3DCVGN,it was a birthday present for my grandson and he loves it!

R2HUTINHHLD0DU,"i love all of the added ""revenge"" cards."
R3S1P7AY58OLAW,okay these work too well.
R3S1P7AY58OLAW,if you are really diabolical you will love these shock pens and i hope karma gets you.
R2VI4YZJNT1AS6,my daughter absolutely loves her new backpack and school stuff!
R1EBUNTEWMU1V3,3 stars only because being somewhat of a purist when it comes to replicas of famous vehicles i notice little things.
R1EBUNTEWMU1V3,the car in the movie had air vents on the fenders like a gnx where hotwheels put a grandnational logo.
R1EBUNTEWMU1V3,"its only a toy, but come on!"
R2GDM70OOJUS58,too cool.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,i bought this for my 7 year old nephew.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,he loved it!
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,it is challenging and thought provoking.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,it is fantastic for problem solving and abstract thinking.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,he couldnt put this down.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,he would solve one level and couldnt wait to start the next puzzle.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,the cards are thin and we couldnt get the circuit to work when we laid the paper pattern on the grid and put the pieces on top of it.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,i can see why you wouldnt want to do this because you would cover up the board that lights up.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,one product suggestion that may help in the future is if the puzzles were on clear plastic pages instead of the thin card like paper.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,dont worry about the patterns ripping because they are all in the instruction book as well.
R3L77F3WKYQRU8,this was a very big hit!
RSHI90RCXKX9N,motor 4 behaves a bit differently than the others.
RDOT5XF8Z32Q4,my nephew loves it too.
RDOT5XF8Z32Q4,his 70 yearold grandparents love it.
RDOT5XF8Z32Q4,and my university engineering students love it.
R2QHJO517EIZNP,nice little bowling set for the little ones
R2A75NB73X9JON,"this would be a brilliant toy if it worked properly, but as other reviewers have noted, there are some issues with the app  for example, my miposaur rarely dances through the app, and wont trace the path onscreen."
R2A75NB73X9JON,this is frustrating and has resulted in lots of back and forth with the makers.
R2A75NB73X9JON,its not a bluetooth issue as disconnected all my other bluetooth devices and even turned off wireless.
R2A75NB73X9JON,very annoying.
R78T0IG6OGCJK,awesome game!
R78T0IG6OGCJK,its a bit difficult to explain but by the second game newcomers are having a lot of fun.
R78T0IG6OGCJK,it walks a fine line where the game is competitive but not to the point where there is any conflict.
RPUQFUE237IX3,i had real trouble with this!
RPUQFUE237IX3,bought two of them....reached out to the seller but no response.
RPUQFUE237IX3,the problem is that the leash pops out and doesnt want to stay.
RPUQFUE237IX3,"one of the boards did well, the other didnt do well at all and my husband tried to glue the leash into that plug but it wasnt a success."
RPUQFUE237IX3,"i wouldnt buy another, sad to say."
R22SJRIE50UB5N,very pretty but they have become evil.
R22SJRIE50UB5N,a purging ritual will be performed soon.
R22SJRIE50UB5N,"no fault of the manufacturer, just sometimes good dice go bad."
RMUCGX0MBIUZ8,bought this for my 10 year old daughter but i enjoy playing with it as well

R2NZ5XFBMPCQT8,"i purchased this for my nephew, he absolutely loved it."

R26BWISXSILNOQ,perfect condition.
R3JNEJ9K38G8P7,my granddaughter loved this little pup.
R3JNEJ9K38G8P7,she would turn it n and run around the house and let the puppy chase her.the batteries lasted a good while too.
R3JNEJ9K38G8P7,i am so glad i purchased this for her .
R3JNEJ9K38G8P7,she has had tons of fun with this
R1E8YVDBFIKB9L,so awesome!
RQE3O034XJ5KS,really fun project for 6yo at a great price.
R3SOSUNO3BXQ9K,first off for a relatively affordable construction set the finished results look pretty good.
R3SOSUNO3BXQ9K,once you get the contraption up and running the set itself looks pretty neat with some eye catching use of contrasting colored pieces and the whole rube goldberg style of patchwork and zany construction.
R3SOSUNO3BXQ9K,the instructions are fairly spot on in that it will take about 12 hours to put this thing together took me a little more than an hour.
R3SOSUNO3BXQ9K,there are over 100 pieces to the set but thankfully they are nicely separated in various sealed pouches and every single piece has an id number etched on it making things much easier especially during initial sorting of pieces for each step of the process.where this kit gets problematic is the overall rickety feel to the finished construction  particularly with the support pillars.
R3SOSUNO3BXQ9K,if you have youngsters playing with this set  things will eventually fall apart and youll be frequently summoned to get the various gears and slides back into place note be sure to keep the instructions tucked somewhere for future reference.
R3SOSUNO3BXQ9K,"if certain pieces snapped in a bit more securely there would be a much more solid feel to it all but as it stands this is a bit of a fragile construction that while pretty to look at, requires a gentle touch when interacting with it."
R12AUPRT60QP1G,great set.
R12AUPRT60QP1G,it comes with 120 pieces which is a good amount if you have two kids that are sharing.
R5UANMMDSZ8A8,these are not lego.
R5UANMMDSZ8A8,missing pieces.
R1NO7WQIAW3JM5,very happy.
R1NO7WQIAW3JM5,thank you.

RM3RCDKMHTTM7,"i received this set used for my grandchildren, ages 5 & 6 first and second grade."
RM3RCDKMHTTM7,i am surprised another reviewer talked of using this game with her fouryear old.
RM3RCDKMHTTM7,bright child!
RM3RCDKMHTTM7,it is very appropriate for the money tasks given in the early school years.
RM3RCDKMHTTM7,my grand kids love it and like to compete among each other to see who can be the first to give me the correct answer.
R3NO5PT6R452V,my baby loves it.
R3NO5PT6R452V,to me thats all that matters.

RA4518OP3XBN4,this does not look like the picture i got it and was highly disappointed the horns were lopsided to begin with and the horns were oddly shaped almost like chicken legs if anything i felt ridiculous wearing it
R2SRXC8EF46D64,the oven us nice enough.
R2SRXC8EF46D64,the 9 accessories are more limited then id like.
R2SRXC8EF46D64,"of the 75 songs , melodies."
R2SRXC8EF46D64,sounds and phrases most are short.
R2SRXC8EF46D64,".its educational in that it teaches colors, numbers, fruit and shapes good for the little backer in your life."
RUQVK3R7RZ7EJ,great book for keeping child quiet and entertained.
RUQVK3R7RZ7EJ,it teaches a child shapes and colors as well as keeps her engaged in manipulative activities.
RUQVK3R7RZ7EJ,im using it for a long plane flight.
RUQVK3R7RZ7EJ,it will keep olivia happy and fellow passengers wont be annoyed by any squeaks and squawks.
RUQVK3R7RZ7EJ,great toddler or even new baby gift.
R34FBCV9TOYWGO,cant beat the price!
R34FBCV9TOYWGO,only reason for the 45 is because of the packaging.
R34FBCV9TOYWGO,these came individually slacked in clear plastic bags.
R34FBCV9TOYWGO,no labels.
R34FBCV9TOYWGO,no names or instructions.
R34FBCV9TOYWGO,still wondering how to wrap these as they are from santa.

RS1ZR4LHYKN3N,looks exactly like the ones i had as a child.
R21YF96WQLWRC2,"extremely happy with this for the price you cant go wrong, wonderful sculpt and game piece."
R21YF96WQLWRC2,"you get the entire set, queen plus base, alien and predator figures for $15.00 how can you beat that."
R21YF96WQLWRC2,"you cant, yeah it is not a starter set however if you have a starter set this will make a great addition to it."
R21YF96WQLWRC2,if you dont have a starter set you can still play just go online and download the core rules from wizkids.com and get 2 6d dice.
R21YF96WQLWRC2,my son and i are having a lot of fun with this set and we just got into playing the hero clix and horror clix gaming scenarios.
R21YF96WQLWRC2,it is doing exactly what i hoped it would and now my son wants to play the clix game instead of being on xbox and that in itself makes it great.
R21YF96WQLWRC2,well done wizkids.
R21YF96WQLWRC2,well done.
R21YF96WQLWRC2,"so, pick this up along with a starter set and get the kids involved as this will also help strengthen their math skills as well as yours, above all just have fun with the kids as this game and the figures will help keep their interest."
R21YF96WQLWRC2,happy gaming folks.
R10X4LZ7UWTW9Z,"cute and looks like the picture, but 6"" really isnt that big."

R2LHGCLX5KW3NW,pretty easy to wash. looks good.
R2LHGCLX5KW3NW,my son and his playmates love it.
R2LHGCLX5KW3NW,i actually catch my 12 year old laying on it sometimes too.
R2LHGCLX5KW3NW,the really great thing about this one is how much less it costs than so many of the other ones that are exactly the same with different characters on them.
R1SQRKQ8AOZQSN,a
R1JDMQB1WL9HBU,this is my second time buying these.
R1JDMQB1WL9HBU,totally not necessary to play  you can use scrap paper  but it made a fun hostess gift.
R33EERI3R1GHDZ,my second review....the product was missing a part & the company did contact me & the part was delivered less than a week later.
R33EERI3R1GHDZ,the company was helpful & polite to me.
R33EERI3R1GHDZ,"my grandchildren were over on the weekend & loved this...ages 3,5, & 7. i like that it isnt too high so when they fall they suffer no injury."
R33EERI3R1GHDZ,"i feel like it was easy to put together, mostly, my grandchildren love it!"
R33EERI3R1GHDZ,it makes a great framework also for putting blankets on to make a play tent.
R33EERI3R1GHDZ,the only warning is that the product is not recommended for under 32 degree weather.
R33EERI3R1GHDZ,that point was not made clear to me until i got it & read the warnings.
R33EERI3R1GHDZ,"since we live in a cold winter area, i will have to take it apart in a few places to store."
R33EERI3R1GHDZ,"so if you have cold winters & thought to leave out, you might want to remember this."
R1GLGOTZZEOGWC,i bought this game to take on vacation for my five year old granddaughter and her mom and dad.
R1GLGOTZZEOGWC,"it has been a lot of fun and we enjoyed playing it, especially the first night."
R1GLGOTZZEOGWC,"however, one all the cards have been used, the game isnt as much fun."
R1GLGOTZZEOGWC,it would be nice to be able to purchase additional cards.
R1GLGOTZZEOGWC,i wonder if a set of flashcards might be a good option when needing more cards for the game.
R1WD9GQBPLKQ8O,just what i wanted!
R1WD9GQBPLKQ8O,this arrived just in time for my son for his first plane ride!
R1WD9GQBPLKQ8O,he loves to throw a ball around but i was worried about it rolling to the back of the plane.
R1WD9GQBPLKQ8O,this was the perfect alternative!!
R1WD9GQBPLKQ8O,"hes only 1.5 years old so the size was perfect for him, but keep in mind that this is not the large koosh ball we were used to"
R31C83I3VT9DL6,my son is autistic and these work great for him.
R31C83I3VT9DL6,i highly recommend.
REOLRJAWWUTA8,shipping was ok seeing that it ships from china.
REOLRJAWWUTA8,was a little disappointed with product as i was expecting it to be an insulated lunch box for my daughter for school.
REOLRJAWWUTA8,but i may have overlooked that in the description.
REOLRJAWWUTA8,but the price you cant beat.
R1KSOJ5WYHXZW8,thanks.
R10K2V1NXE3L4V,my 2 year old granddaughter loves it and plays with the set everyday.
R10K2V1NXE3L4V,the items are smaller than i thought they would be but they are the perfect size and height for her.
R10K2V1NXE3L4V,my son assembled them and said it was easy to do.
R10K2V1NXE3L4V,no complaints.
R2ODKKPSTOBIEI,"i have owned rubiks cubes before, but they have always been the standard ones that dont turn if they arent perfectly lined up, and the corners of the stickers start peeling after a couple of weeks, so when i wanted a new one i decided to get this one."
R2ODKKPSTOBIEI,"so far it has been nothing but great, it turns extremely easy, even if you arent even close to having it lined up properly, and you dont have to worry about peeling since its all colored plastic."
R2ODKKPSTOBIEI,"i also havent had any issues with popping from this cube, overall i would recommend it to anybody looking for a nice cube at a good price."
R2FRV2QS7J1VO1,these were exactly what we expected.
R2FRV2QS7J1VO1,"we ordered them for use for our sons camping birthday party, and whats not to love when youre 4 and you have glowsticks?"
R2J86YZA4ENENH,a bobblehead yellow submarine?
R2J86YZA4ENENH,now im a hit at all of my beatles parties.
R2N3CSDRBEH85K,i love this !
R2N3CSDRBEH85K,wouldnt fit a two years old unless your little 1 is really small !
RZSXZKUKNPCCK,the product smells awful.
RZSXZKUKNPCCK,there was a strong bad smell as soon as i opened it.
RZSXZKUKNPCCK,"i thought after cleaning it thoroughly, the smell would go away."
RZSXZKUKNPCCK,"even after using lots of lysol wipes and spray, it still smells like really bad."
R3H4WOE0ESTKPT,great toy
R3F2407WEV0WVR,very cute.
R3F2407WEV0WVR,"dont expect the reusable pouches to last for long because they are kinda thin, but a good product for the cost."
R39L5B77D4SM49,my granddaughter spend hours playing with the set.
R39L5B77D4SM49,she loves it
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,this hybrid electronic deviceboard game for adults is a fun and interesting concept that utilizes the best of both worlds your electronics device and a board game for both tactile competitive play and a video screen.this game works with an app on your android or apple tablet device.
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,i am using it with a kindle fire tablet.
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"after downloading the app, firing it up and positioning the board properly so that your devices camera can see it it will indicate when it is, you are ready to go note that the app is free to download but useless without the game board and pieces."
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"it may be a bit tricky getting it lined up at first and you may need more space inbetween the board and your tablet than you first imagine, so make sure you have plenty of space on your table or floor."
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"i had to move the board about two to three feet from the tablet before it gave me the ok.what comes in the box is a stand for your tablet, a square plastic board with two buttons and six wager markers."
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,what is really fascinating is that there are no electronics here at all and thus no batteries required.
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,the game works through the utilization of the camera on your tablet to detect button presses and wagers placed.
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"i was skeptical at first, but it all works quite accurately and seamlessly.the app is well designed and makes this game a lot of fun, interesting and even personal."
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,you play with two teams and create your own team names by combining two words from a given list.
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"thats not all, you can also take selfie pics of up to four players that are utilized with animation during game play."
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"there are different types of movie trivia categories and questions used in the game, and there are three different game typeslengths.this game is best suited for young adults and adults since it requires a decent breadth of knowledge of movies."
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"in my limited play so far, the game is quite fun."
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"of course the fun only lasts as long as there is always a new supply of trivia questionsmedia available, so hopefully there will be an ever evolving selection as of now there appears to be only one choice of a series of trivia available to select, but there are additional ones marked &34coming soon&34.the box thoughtfully has a handle so the game is easy to carry to friends homes, etc.i love the concept, like the game, and hope to see more of this and other types of similar games.efully there will be an ever evolving selection as of now there appears to be only one choice of a series of trivia available to select, but there are additional ones marked &34coming soon&34."
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"the box thoughtfully has a handle so the game is easy to carry to friends homes, etc."
R2TZ9FS6SSS1G0,"i love the concept, like the game, and hope to see more of this and other types of similar games."
R384406OE7SY1K,these are expensive for what you get.
R384406OE7SY1K,"the process is kind of neat of hatching the egg, but all that youre really paying for is a cheap, little plastic toy inside the egg."
R1C9J0CZ75D4LD,life is better
R3SRZA9441SHX7,he loves this set still
R1N61TJF2WTM4F,very entertaining.

RUJ01YYERWAMV,she sings along with songs it plays.
RUJ01YYERWAMV,too cute.
R3D1GUMD8O9T3K,shipping wasnt a perfect 55 but i guess you get what you pay for which was 0.00 for shipping other than that great figure a little rough on the joints but great figure nonetheless
RB8TZD5AMKE40,the photo is not accurate to the second production run of the figure.
RB8TZD5AMKE40,its from the first production batch.
RB8TZD5AMKE40,the merida i received was tanner and her dress was a dusty blue not a dark blue.
R2IO140ZN81GBD,great product!
R2IO140ZN81GBD,grandchildren all love them and can use them from age 1 to age 12....... we adults have fun too!

RWK4N9QGSWS3A,looks like the real thing.
RWK4N9QGSWS3A,my three year old who is into music loves it!
RUHNSUW4HYH7L,"the package arrived on time, surprisingly fast."
RUHNSUW4HYH7L,but the contents were not up to my expectations.
RUHNSUW4HYH7L,"there were only common cards and 35 of the same card, also cards in chinese that are unusable."
RUHNSUW4HYH7L,out of all the cards i was able to use only about 10 of them.
RUHNSUW4HYH7L,"sorry but i will not purchase again, even though there were about 50 extra cards in the package."
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,having had a day to play around with the vex iq kit i figure now would be a good time to share some first impressions.
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,there are a lot of parts so i recommend getting some sort of storage system to keep them all sorted.
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,"the structure beams are very sturdy, and not nearly as bendy as lego ev3."
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,"speaking of ev3, i love that the vex iq brain has 12 ports."
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,three times as many as lego.
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,"the display on the brain is very easy to read, and very responsive as well."
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,"a couple minor downsides there were a lot of plastic bags with various parts included in the kit, so it took awhile to unpack everything."
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,"not a problem with the system at all, just took a little time to sort everything."
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,"while it got much easier over time, the resistance of putting some shaft collars could be difficult."
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,"nonetheless, after spending just a day with the vex iq kit, i already prefer it over ev3, and would recommend it to anybody with children interested in robotics ive got a 14 year old and an 11 year old, and they love it."
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,"the parts are easy to build with, and very reasonably priced."
R1LKWNDTFUMZHZ,"i see a lot of room for expansion, and am excited to see what vex iq comes out with next."
R3HNYT7TJ3BGTL,this is a cute toddlar tent but keep in mind u do pay for what you get most of the time and this is one of those times.
R3HNYT7TJ3BGTL,i bought this for my my lil boys birthday who was turning 4 and it was a lil rough!
R3HNYT7TJ3BGTL,i mean he could fit but not much room to play.
R3HNYT7TJ3BGTL,it is convenient how it folds up so easily n quickly though so when we need the extra space.
R31H38C66VT6AG,she loves it!
R2XWE6ZE0MXAOE,"this is a knock off version of james georges invention, it is not tuned properly nor does it contain the proper material and you will likelybe embarrassed in front of your audience if you attempt using this to fool people."
R2XWE6ZE0MXAOE,you will be far more satisfied with the original version as it is around the same price and of superior quality and retraction distance.
R2XWE6ZE0MXAOE,be warned!!
R2XWE6ZE0MXAOE,this is a knock off of an original artists effect.
R12P9G2A6V9LN,great bags people cant stop asking where i got it.
R3IDGGZJOCD0FU,look forward to build it
RAV6QM6ULKG96,awesome!
RAV6QM6ULKG96,used this as tick tock crock for my sons jake and the neverland pirate party.
RAV6QM6ULKG96,"it added that extra touch to the ""walk the plank"" activity."
R30P1XLBJGB777,i bought this pool in july and didnt get the opportunity to even take it out of the box until this past weekend.
R30P1XLBJGB777,"when we set it up, the top ring apparently has numerous leaks and wont even begin to hold water."
R30P1XLBJGB777,"i did not look at the return policy that it could only be returned for 30 days, so yes i was disappointed."
R2LGJV41D8OMA1,this playground arrived with no parts.
R2LGJV41D8OMA1,they told us to contact the manufacturer and that they couldnt help us.
R2LGJV41D8OMA1,manufacturer doesnt respond to phone calls not emails.
R2LGJV41D8OMA1,so we have $400 worth of wood sitting in our backyard.
R2LGJV41D8OMA1,not happy at all!
R2LGJV41D8OMA1,very poor customer service.
R3GGC23TTA7CP0,great puzzle for families andor adults.
R3GGC23TTA7CP0,"its tricky enough to be challenging, but not so challenging that it takes forever to finish."

R1G4VJCFXWKJT6,fun to fly.
R1G4VJCFXWKJT6,good battery life.
R3COTSZGL2YFI0,great selfworking trick.
R3COTSZGL2YFI0,excellent gift for children.

R3COTSZGL2YFI0,"""."
R2CHJHMMTKAURQ,came new as indicated.
R2CHJHMMTKAURQ,also arrived much sooner than the expected delivery date.

RC35P6OBLPZPP,the package arrived early and works very well
R32875LG4K6ZRJ,product package not shipping pkg arrived opened and 6 bags were missing.
R32875LG4K6ZRJ,"it was as if someone ordered the pack of 100, took out the 6 they needed and returned the rest."
R3KH2DXSYIFCFO,another great lego kit.
RYSTLII34SCEE,i love these things.
RYSTLII34SCEE,they are the perfect way to decorate a blank wall at a party and great for taking pictures in front of.
R1RKH9KTCR40U7,these are so fun!
R38FVXDLQ7G9LF,smaller than i thought
R2O8D2QB0TZWWJ,"ordered 2, one didnt work."
R2O8D2QB0TZWWJ,sent them both back.
R2O8D2QB0TZWWJ,not worth the money.
R1RPQ5E0WP8198,this product is exactly what it said however it stop working after a few days i will return it however its very nice but small i guess for the price it will be
RJEST9B4NYMZG,i bought this for my 3 year old son.
RJEST9B4NYMZG,he loves it now but wasis extremely disappointed that the wheels dont work.
R172Y82FLMS1VW,love this little copter.
R172Y82FLMS1VW,bought it to learn quad flying and it has been great for that.
R172Y82FLMS1VW,crash a bunch but it is easily repairable if it needs to be.
R172Y82FLMS1VW,parts are cheap but beware who you buy them from.
R172Y82FLMS1VW,some parts are of poor quality.
R3JEMFBWDSINT0,adorable!
R3JEMFBWDSINT0,!
R1KKC0VHHD7UVR,well out of the box with factory settings.
R1KKC0VHHD7UVR,"it would handle a 2s , 5200kv but not 3s."
R1KKC0VHHD7UVR,i lowered my gears and bought a programmer and wow!
R1KKC0VHHD7UVR,but then after about the 3rd or 4th 3s the fan burned out.
R1KKC0VHHD7UVR,i have had rcs for over 26 years i run the heck out of everything.
R1KKC0VHHD7UVR,i replaced the fan and have had no problems.
R1SSGWZLIIG1SV,my granddaughter loves paw patrol...
R2TGITOUHZE17Y,"so far, no problems flying this plane."
R2TGITOUHZE17Y,"the maiden flight was anticlimatic, esp."
R2TGITOUHZE17Y,landing.
R2TGITOUHZE17Y,"this things comes in so smooth and slows way down when flaring.one note, i think the tail screws are a little long."
R2TGITOUHZE17Y,make sure you have the right sized screwdriver and grip.
R2TGITOUHZE17Y,"dont overtighten, but make sure they are holding the tail down snug."
R2TGITOUHZE17Y,"with a little work, i got mine right, but another pilot at the club was having the same problem with his apprentice."
R2TGITOUHZE17Y,"the aft screw is even more difficult because the tail is thinner here.you need a huge amount of space for beginner mode, the throws are very restrictive in this mode."
R1V0J2VSIVNZUN,one of the grenades was cracked along where the pin goes in.the build quality is ok.not bad for the price.
R1V0J2VSIVNZUN,and since ill be removing the batteries and most likely repainting.
RM3JADMFO2LZX,my daughter loves it.
RU2D28LR2BOUN,it ran quite a bit smaller than i was hoping.
RU2D28LR2BOUN,"im hoping it makes it through a few halloween outings, pretty cheaply made."
R2B2Z689TOUHBA,know that this is a model and its fragile as one.
R2B2Z689TOUHBA,"its not hard to put together, but the pieces fall apart easily unless you use glue."
R2B2Z689TOUHBA,the coloration was fine.
R2B2Z689TOUHBA,"overall, just didnt think it was the best quality."
R3U5ZSK9Y0PDZA,i have purchased this item 3 times already and all my nieces and nephews have loved it.
R3U5ZSK9Y0PDZA,it also comes in blue.
R3U5ZSK9Y0PDZA,the size is perfect for little ones and its def.
R3U5ZSK9Y0PDZA,cheaper than the lego alternative.
R3U5ZSK9Y0PDZA,its also great for motor skill development
RQYP7V5YVDOG7,my son and i love this set.
RQYP7V5YVDOG7,personally i think it is one of the better sets for the money in recent memory.
RQYP7V5YVDOG7,"to get scooby, shaggy, fred, the mystery machine and more for under $30 was a good value for us."
RQYP7V5YVDOG7,the mystery machine build and decals were excellent.
RQYP7V5YVDOG7,and the zombie  haunted tree were a bonus.
RQYP7V5YVDOG7,i highly recommend this one.
R1CZ56YVEAEA19,excelente

R3FS8QB5MSMKUA,cute!
R1A8MHW4X9FHH7,tape cassette damaged
R1F18SPVMTV6SC,this is a fun and educational project.
R1F18SPVMTV6SC,my 7 year old grandson had a fun time doing it.
R1F18SPVMTV6SC,he even spray painted his can and gave his little robot a name.
R1F18SPVMTV6SC,he had fun changing the eyes and giving his robot character.
R1F18SPVMTV6SC,i would recommend it for something different to do besides electronics.
R3FTYZN4L8XI4V,a gift for a kid who just likes those cards
R1OVEGDACX49V5,very disappointed.
R1OVEGDACX49V5,"i specifically asked if this puppets mouth opened and was told yes, but that is not correct."
R1OVEGDACX49V5,there is a hole for each arm and that is all.
R1OVEGDACX49V5,the sound is very annoying.
R1OVEGDACX49V5,i will be returning since it is not what i need and i was misinformed.
R3HFI8Z7ADCVMV,these are pretty cheaply made will easily break.
R3HFI8Z7ADCVMV,"we used them in a pinata, some broke falling the short distance to the ground."

R2G33IQW4BWZ0G,what a cute stuffed musical bunny for a child.
R3TSNKO57POVAJ,we ordered this with the intention of it being a lego table.
R3TSNKO57POVAJ,our son has a couple lego trains that needed to come up off the floor of his bedroom.
R3TSNKO57POVAJ,"the table was easy to put together, however at one point we applied too much pressure and one of the pinsscrews broke through the pressed wood."
R3TSNKO57POVAJ,"it is durable, just be careful when putting it together, there is such a thing as dont force it!"
R3TSNKO57POVAJ,"the drawer holds all of his extra track pieces, and so far it has been a great addition to his bedroom."
R25BXMH9TMPNV3,just what my grandson wanted.
RFWNX0XC10K8O,"super adorable but the wood cracked on several dolls within 2 weeks, 3 out of 5 are too hard to open and it took a long time to deliver."
R1DK06JJSVFOT2,this toy is worthless and junk.
R1DK06JJSVFOT2,it worked initially but not very well.
R1DK06JJSVFOT2,it is not the least bit durable and sinks in water.
R1DK06JJSVFOT2,i really want a refund.
R1DK06JJSVFOT2,this was a gift for our 9 year old grandson and it is a huge disappointment.
R1DK06JJSVFOT2,"i wish i could post with no stars, but thats not possible."
R3RMSSEGRX0IPC,my 6 year old granddaughter loved this and enjoyed making them.
RYHHDF337CE2I,"my kids ages 7 and 9 love this game, one of their all times favorite."

R14QAEZ6PIV08G,"i have the exact same feedback as ""dont get scammed!"""

R14QAEZ6PIV08G,they say super good job good effort fantastic a and please correct and return.
R14QAEZ6PIV08G,this is not what is shown in the picture and not what i need for my classroom.

R14QAEZ6PIV08G,do not buy this product unless what i have described is what you would like.

RFK7N3UPTEKI2,"high quality, and fits my 38"" tall 3 year old wonderfully!"
RFK7N3UPTEKI2,"the bottom hits just above his ankles, which means he will be able to enjoy it for several years."
RFK7N3UPTEKI2,"he wears it all over the house and to the park, and it has held up to typical 3year old wear and tear quite nicely."

R3PK3IIFBV3ISU,warning group can get loud and scare the neighbors.
R1MX6W0BD42T27,we purchased a set of these soakers.
R1MX6W0BD42T27,one of them stopped working the first day and the other one worked great.
R1MX6W0BD42T27,there should be better quality control on these products.
REYJLXT3R2P8G,this was not at all the pump i received.
REYJLXT3R2P8G,a very cheaply made version arrived and broke in 2 separate places within hours of opening the package.
REYJLXT3R2P8G,im very dissappointed and am looking for a suitable replacement.

R1RCIW6H6UQK27,my 5 year old son loves this book and he hates to color!!
R1RCIW6H6UQK27,"he found all of the dinosaurs first, of course."
R1RCIW6H6UQK27,he likes creating pictures for me now and i hang them up for everyone to see.
R1RCIW6H6UQK27,he has gotten so much better at staying in the lines and coloring all white spaces.
R1RCIW6H6UQK27,love this book!
R1RCIW6H6UQK27,my 3 year old daughter also enjoys coloring the princesses and castles...she doesnt follow the suggested colors or stay in the lines but i love that this book has something for both genders!
R1RCIW6H6UQK27,very equal in that aspect.
R95GU5YWSXQLJ,i used this program for our first year of homeschooling.
R95GU5YWSXQLJ,we homeschooled for second and fifth grade.
R95GU5YWSXQLJ,it is such a wonderful addition to our language curriculum.
R95GU5YWSXQLJ,the girls love watching the videos and listening to the songs.

R2KRKUQM1DK9O4,cute product
R176P35E938LZ1,c rating is not accurate.

R2IH91TFXS3A58,adjusting the seat on this bike is a real pain in the butt and very frustrating.

R304P6A2FG9S1G,"if youre going for a little desktop toy and are a big fan of sonic like my son is, then youre going to love this."
R3ODTQPXOBTMWK,cute set for a toddler.
R3ODTQPXOBTMWK,i got for my 3 year old twins.
R3ODTQPXOBTMWK,"they loved playing with it, but it didnt last long."
R3ODTQPXOBTMWK,"they can be kind of rough on toys, but the mat was thinner than i was expecting."
R3ODTQPXOBTMWK,"they still play with the cars, but the mat lasted about 4 months then got ripped to pieces."
R3JV8G8M25A0FJ,i got this after i had a battery almost explode on me.
R3JV8G8M25A0FJ,ive seen it happen to others at the track.
R3JV8G8M25A0FJ,the bag is very sturdy and the price is great.
R3JV8G8M25A0FJ,my batteries fit great.
R3JV8G8M25A0FJ,better safe than sorry.
RTKC4CK47F0QO,"one of the cutter skeleton costumes out there for baby, but doesnt have a hat so i also ordered jamie rae skull cap to go with this costume."
R1RTHGGN3PXYHF,i got this little big world fast food set for my daughter for her kitchen.
R1RTHGGN3PXYHF,"this set was perfect, it comes with so much and it looks so real."

R2B708SDTQRXXD,"easy assembly, and our oneyearold granddaughter loved it."
RJYDNL4IZ7E3G,ugh where to begin?
RJYDNL4IZ7E3G,"im a huge fan of ultra pro products they are the only things i use for all my card games cards ,yugioh, magic, force of will, and pokemon this is really the first in all my years of tcg playing i have hated one of their products!"
RJYDNL4IZ7E3G,i have wanted to double sleeve my standard size playing cards for a while and i bought these because they were ultra pro.
RJYDNL4IZ7E3G,i waited and was so excited to get them but when i tried them on all they did was bow my cards!
RJYDNL4IZ7E3G,they were so tight i bent some cards trying to get them in!
RJYDNL4IZ7E3G,i then bought the kmc perfect fit ones and although the quality of these may feel better then the kmc ones im certain that the kmc ones fit perfect on all cards i listed!
RJYDNL4IZ7E3G,i bought 3 packs of these and through all 3 packs away.
RJYDNL4IZ7E3G,"dont be fooled by the little ""improved"" insert they put in with the sleeves too it doesnt mean they are any better trust me i tried."
RJYDNL4IZ7E3G,for the first time ever i can honestly say i will not be buying these from ultra pro again.
R28WYPC94FF5ED,i was pleased with the product.
R1T0IGPG82UM6A,added bonus for my classroom super hero theme
R22OOR9Q242EK5,not a good product.
R22OOR9Q242EK5,the handle broke in half on the second day of use at the beach.
R22OOR9Q242EK5,sorry it was not a stronger shovel
R22FZIC31I5RFK,great set to build.
R6TT7R0HBFPSQ,"the 2nd edition comes with 7 miniexpansions in the box, which makes for a lot of variety in the game."
R6TT7R0HBFPSQ,"games seem fairly random in the base set, but the expansions add a lot of depth in meeting a certain order of goals or using your discard pile as a manapool for spells."
R2M16KJ15AW6OY,my 9yr daughter who loves too cookbake also loves to make food sculptures with playdoh.
R2M16KJ15AW6OY,i knew when i saw this set that the tools in it would be a hit.
R2M16KJ15AW6OY,her 13yr cousin wanted one too!
R2M16KJ15AW6OY,this set allows kids to make very realistic sweets.
R2M16KJ15AW6OY,what a treat!
R1PASP7V2S5C30,fun throwback game for all ages.
R1PASP7V2S5C30,it does not take hours to play so if you only have to kill 10 minutes this game is great and fun.
R1PASP7V2S5C30,a little fragile if the players are older.
R1MB5CIM75NT8B,my 3 year old twins love this doll and her little kitten.
R1MB5CIM75NT8B,"the doll is super cute, and seems to be built very sturdy."
R1MB5CIM75NT8B,"she is brightly cores, with magenta hair."
R1MB5CIM75NT8B,which i think most kids would like.
R1MB5CIM75NT8B,"the disappearing cape is a little silly, and when wearing the cape, the doll the has a long dangling string behind her."
R1MB5CIM75NT8B,overall i like the doll and would recommend it for friends kids.
R1MB5CIM75NT8B,my kids are really enjoying her!
R3N92D1RB6NIIW,i love them
R1RZB84SUB6CXP,in time for my boys birthday.
R1RZB84SUB6CXP,i love it.
R2JK7LAXHEBZYI,this is a great bed.
R2JK7LAXHEBZYI,would highly recommend it.
R1V99NOVU1K0H7,leaks all over the place and barely blows bubbles.. not worth the money
R2UJIU2GWG1NNR,very good
REBY25OE1ALEG,amazing game to play for fun times!
RPNY9TIK6G6ID,great sticks  inexpensive and very bright for 6 hours.
R27VBE80I4P4W,worked for about 30 seconds and quit!
R27VBE80I4P4W,my granddaughter was majorly disappointed.
R27VBE80I4P4W,my husband who is excellent at fixing things couldnt get it to work so we sent it back
R2MFKSF7KQY27C,love it
R1LLHWHC52NT9B,my son loves it.

R36RTDKAOUDOI9,the parts to each individual one is easy assembly.
R25F6E5P9PRFZY,awesome
R31M6HAZ0DXPJ0,"the colors are great, but the quality of the pencils is poor."
R31M6HAZ0DXPJ0,"when sharpening, chunks of wood come off the pencils."
R31M6HAZ0DXPJ0,most disappointing.
R2PSLDPI9ZJE0Z,i love little tikes toys.
R2PSLDPI9ZJE0Z,"i puchased this for my one year old great grandson, he loves the horse."
R2PSLDPI9ZJE0Z,perfect size.
RYNUX834NMLMF,thanks for a perfect deal
R2DQAK1JBMOK0S,adorable.
R1RHQEUKHD4IEZ,the ideal complement
R373ALEPSSZ2U0,"middle granddaughter love it, of course she really loves the villians the most."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"ive never owned a figma before, but i have owned other comparable import figures before, so i knew what to expect."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"the figure is actually much better than i expected.i wouldve rather had the version that is pale and in a white bikini, however that one goes for more than twice the cost of this already expensive figure."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"i am glad, however, that i chose this one.sonico is wearing very minimal clothing, and for as skimpy as the outfit is, the articulation doesnt stand out nearly as much as i thought it would."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"all the joints are nice, move very fluidly, and blend in well."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"the torso joint especially is nicely hidden under her breasts, so you really cant see it head on."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"my one minor nitpick with the articulation is that the hands have a visible joint, however the very nice articulation those joints provide outweighs the aesthetics."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"this figure is so well articulated, you can pretty much pose her any way a human can pose."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,the included figure stand assists well in getting her into action poses.paint on this figure is very well done.
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"the skin tone is perfectly tan, and appears slightly shiny, almost as if shes been soaking in the suntan lotion."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"she has a nice little mark on her left thigh, the logo from her anime, and it is pale and appears like a tanning mark like the little hearts and things that women use when they get tanned."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,the mark looks appropriately pale as if it was covered while the rest of her was tanning.
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"the silver on her bikini is very well done, very metallic, and is perfectly applied."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,her faces are very well detailed and have small details that look hand painted and are very well executed.
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"sonicos hair is nicely painted with a light pink to dark pink gradient, and it looks perfect."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"the accessories are all well painted too.sonico comes with a total of 7 different hands for posing, a popsicle, a beach ball, and a floaty ring which i can confirm actually floats!."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,all of the accessories are perfectly themed for her to have some summer fun.
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"she also includes a figma stand that, as previously mentioned, is very useful in assisting her in action poses.overall, the figma ex023 super sonico suntanned version is a very good value."
R3MNMTYI1EBPN3,"its cute, posable, and a good conversation piece people on instagram are always asking how they can get one.. highly reccomended for fans of anime, figma, action figures in general, and girls in bikinis."
R1IQJ255K3I7O4,"i got it pretty quickly, but the paint job on his face is a little messed up."
R1DHZLUNBZB5TL,my son likes them.
R2P4YF9UPPN4NB,great to play with the glider castle.
R2P4YF9UPPN4NB,they role well down the ramps
R2RM1KYPN8FSP9,this reboot of a beloved franchise has encountered a lot of resistance from old fans.
R2RM1KYPN8FSP9,"but as a starter kit, this set is unmatched for getting into a new game."
R2RM1KYPN8FSP9,the models are fantastic and worth the price alone.
R2RM1KYPN8FSP9,"that said, assembly is time consuming and not for those just looking to plugandplay."
R2RM1KYPN8FSP9,the rules  while not having the depth of the old system  are easily learned and make the game accessible to those looking to get back into warhammer or start playing for the first.
R390PS7EWSUXC0,kids love it
R3F18797JO0DFT,this did not really work.
R2KIMNBTUM50B4,i have an inhome childcare center with 14 children ranging in age from 11 months to 9 years and they all love these!
R2KIMNBTUM50B4,best toy in the house!
R1ENGGMJGF2Y49,"i have no idea why kids like these so much, but they are a hit with mine."
RCQRS3OR6AAHD,"i was very excited when i read the reviews and ordered this diabolo because i felt it was the ""complete package."""
RCQRS3OR6AAHD,"unfortunately, nothing on the video is created for beginners...each and every one of the tricks is for someone with much more experience than i have."
RCQRS3OR6AAHD,i may end up returning it because of thisbut im going to try it out with the little that i know about how to get it going.
RCQRS3OR6AAHD,"im very, very disappointed as i was planning to ""follow the instructions"" on the video to get at least competent."
RCQRS3OR6AAHD,but thats not going to happen!
R2XN6ZYJ89UTCF,this is awesome .
R2ZBB4WO85RS2C,"beautiful little pin, but slightly smaller than i expected  for reference, its exactly the size of a us quarter."
R2ZBB4WO85RS2C,"also, packaging was a bit flimsy bubble wrap envelope which resulted in the back pin being bent."
R1J5Q7I8WA621O,ok
R335X6202PHQ1K,good quality puzzle
R277G80L7GPMK4,this is so cute!
R277G80L7GPMK4,my 3 year old loves it.
R277G80L7GPMK4,"it fits him great, and has room to grow."
R277G80L7GPMK4,i like how you can adjust it to fit bigger kids.
R277G80L7GPMK4,"my son ran around the house for a hour cracking us up, and chasing the dog."
R277G80L7GPMK4,i personally think this is a steal deal.
R277G80L7GPMK4,mask is made very well.
R2PRBEUPJR05R5,place the capsule in a glass of water and in less than 15 minutes you will have a small foam sea creature!
R2PRBEUPJR05R5,there is a chart on the back of the package to identify your creature once hatched.
R3N2XOSWRRMIOM,for granddaughter loves it thank you
R92WV2SFCTI3S,"this set compliments my other set so i can have matching race courses to do ""match racing""."
R3BTBFSMW8C4P7,a must have for any bujin deck.
R3BTBFSMW8C4P7,he is a staple at 3 and the heart and soul of the deck.
R3BTBFSMW8C4P7,he lets you search for any bujin monster and fuel the grave with bujingis.
R3BTBFSMW8C4P7,if youre running any less than 3 of him youre playing the deck wrong.
R3BTBFSMW8C4P7,run 3 yamato.
R1CKBIV9YUFRAK,fun toy!
R11EDTDOT623XS,"was not what i expected, most items too small like pots to use with a toddler kitchen, small bottles worried about child choking.."
R1SJ7JBYT8OCT,pretty sure my granddaughter will love it!
RVXAD9PQCPFAN,children loved it
R35KYRU0WQUWZA,this is darling and very good quality.
R10ANYLJZYVJ7O,"cool set, not lego brand."
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,what an interesting toy.
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,i am a great believer in giving children educational toys and books  they get enough toys from other relatives and friends.
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,i want them to learn as early as they can.
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,"this toy was made in china so if you have a problem with that, i certainly understand."
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,"but, this is aclever item and is made for 4 year olds or children getting ready for preschool."
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,"i have a greatgrandchild that will be 3 in december and as you might guess, i think hes way above average."
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,i showed it to him this weekend and he spent hours trying it out.
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,he might be a tad too young but he knows his abcs and communicates extremely well and has for the last year.
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,this product should help with the sounds of letters and word building.i like that it has a screen cause all they see are people using phones and computers and this makes them feel like they fit in.
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,"anyway, this leapfrog word whammer is neat and it is not expensive."
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,"leapfrog has offices in the usa, the uk, australia and canada and these addresses are on the box.....but no telephone numbers."
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,"if you are like me and like trainingtype toys, then buy this one for a loved one and see how it works."
R30RHZJ2PZBKGA,i think its a good step in the right direction.
R18L3XOHSR7UPN,just as promised!
R18L3XOHSR7UPN,quick delivery and a perfect fit!
R18L3XOHSR7UPN,thankyou!
R2GNS5MS7QM94I,great favorite
R3R4XWIC93APEQ,very flimsy and the marbles are way too small for young children.
R15SO6YQSRHJFC,used it extensively for 2 months and its surface sticker started coming out.
R29TJQETK2FHNU,thin material but decent for the money.
R29TJQETK2FHNU,makes a great treat bag gift.
R3INPJ292EB4NT,"amazing figure, japanese version is way for accurate than the usa one."
R3INPJ292EB4NT,its definitely going in my collection.
R1Z11V5JGJQLN,big hit at county paradetoo heavy for helium but worked out anyway.
R232RQ2LMFMQXJ,definitely not high quality
R98OL4VIVT9RZ,supercute and my daughter loves it.
R98OL4VIVT9RZ,i had the splash kettler for my two older sons and that was adjustable this one isnt.
R98OL4VIVT9RZ,"i recommend the splash over this one because it will fit little kids longer, even though its an extra $3040."
R98OL4VIVT9RZ,the ice thing about this one is that it came wth the handle though i like the circular one for the splash better you cant beat this price for great quality.
R98OL4VIVT9RZ,"well engineered nontipping and i salvaged the seatbelt from my other kettler and installed it on this for my daughter so we can &34ride&34 to the store she has refused a stroller for almost a year, so to save time, this is great over walking.unfortunately my daughter is only 2 almost 3 and it probably wont last a year before she outgrows it."
R98OL4VIVT9RZ,"my sons were able to fit on the splash until 45 years the younger one went to a twowheeler without intermediate step somehow... but my oldest stayed on this, then to balance bike, then to training wheels, then to micromini, which finally gave him the balance and confidence he needed to ride a plain twowheeler.she does love it, but i am sad that her brothers splash rusted too much pedal stopped spinning and handlebars started to go, but it looked brand new until we moved to the caribbean.... saltwater degrades the metal very fast, so perhaps if you also live near the oceanhumid tropics, save your money and get this one, knowing it wont last long you will have experience with rusting metal if you know what i am talking about!.happy riding to the little ones!"
R1COBOHP6FRT76,my 2 yr. old grandson loved it and so did my 40s age son
R17QXAPUCBOVAF,good price for this set!
R2E4UGMN3PVRVC,met needs
RL0V88A6F64M4,we have used these at play places and they were great.
RL0V88A6F64M4,this was very difficult to assemble in spite of few pieces and tools needed.
RL0V88A6F64M4,i am usually pretty good at assembling things and i had to redo it a few times.
RL0V88A6F64M4,once i got it together i found that it doesnt go well at all unless the surfaces are perfectly level.
RL0V88A6F64M4,sort of annoying after a sort of aggravating assembly.
R2VKXXIH1LQ5R8,my 2yo got this for his birthday he is 3 now and still loves it especially the cannon piece.
RG7N71UGV6M6D,"hello just wondering what makes this version ""explicit?"""

R3CZZ5I8CY4N3L,"fun, but it doesnt last more than a week."
R3NZRTHQXLVBZO,"paid $ 23 and received wrong item,planned on returning, but had emergency out of state, get back and son opened box."
R3NZRTHQXLVBZO,this was definitely not worth $23 .
R3NZRTHQXLVBZO,"very disappointed, but was able to find my son his flyer he wanted for his bday."
R1KNWDZEV9KTT2,gift  my grandsons first one got lost so have to replace it as he loves puppies
R9SI05ZAAHIFS,"very detailed, as the iconx branch of me models is."
R9SI05ZAAHIFS,"however, the seams in these pieces didnt fold well or the metal is different... had a hard time bending certain pieces."
R9SI05ZAAHIFS,"also, the pics on the box and the website must be of an earlier model."
R9SI05ZAAHIFS,"current model doesnt have an open windshield, which kind of defeats the purpose of the insane detail inside."
R9SI05ZAAHIFS,"imhave gotten used to the difficulttofollow directions of me products, but this ome takes the cake on confusion."
R9SI05ZAAHIFS,good thing the most confusing bends had extra pieces.
R9SI05ZAAHIFS,"this one could use a few design improvements but overall, great model."
R1LVHWJ47WQPDF,i am the grandmom and i purchased this for my 2 year old grandson.
R1LVHWJ47WQPDF,it is awesome.
R1LVHWJ47WQPDF,the lights are bright and runs on bare floors great.kepp in mind 2 thinks 1it does not run well on carpets.. 2 the music is loud and cannot be turned off while playing with it.
R1LVHWJ47WQPDF,i think its great but my daughter is going crazy with it.
R1LVHWJ47WQPDF,all and all its a well made product and if you are a grandparent you will be a hit with your grandkids.
R1LVHWJ47WQPDF,packaged well and arrived quickly.

R12A9SPGB1B56E,batgirl goes well with my collection of other female superheroes.
R12A9SPGB1B56E,my only complaint the gun does not hold on batgirls hands correctly and the string on the gun is too long.

R3U0W693WUJQ2B,they worked well for their purpose and look real enough.
R2QE0DTP9L5KVK,i bought this for my 4 year old and it fit.
R2QE0DTP9L5KVK,the sleeves and legs were too long but the fit everywhere else was fine.
R2QE0DTP9L5KVK,the costume is cute but the quality is poor.
R2QE0DTP9L5KVK,the cape had several runs in it shown in the picture straight out of the package that quickly spread and made the cape look shredded.
R2QE0DTP9L5KVK,if you want this costume to last or even look good for more than one wear dont bother.
R2QE0DTP9L5KVK,its cute but the quality is not worthy of more than one star.
R10GP91TW7T8WZ,"i know this isnt scientifically ""accurate"", but really now, its a toy."
R10GP91TW7T8WZ,i bought it for my husbandson and they both love it!

RK2R3LNHBC286,"this was a fun project to do with my elevenyearold son, however as soon as you get the instructions, throw them away!"
RK2R3LNHBC286,they were horriblei couldnt understand a thing.
RK2R3LNHBC286,watch a youtube video it makes much more sense.
RK2R3LNHBC286,"also you really dont need a can, a plastic cup or anything cylinderlike would work."
RK2R3LNHBC286,quick easy project that your child will make and never touch again.

RZW8ITUJGKPE,this game has been great fun for my five yearold twin girls.
RZW8ITUJGKPE,"they are familiar with the leapfrog letter factory dvds, so they enjoy the familiar characters.there is enough variety in the game with collecting letters, writing letters, playing mini games, taking photos always their favorite and two player game play that my girls are able to enjoy this game over and over.this game moves smoothly and has a lot of variety."
RZW8ITUJGKPE,"it is a great way to learn the alphabet and a fun way to review letters and sounds.i was concerned that my girls would not enjoy this game as much as they did, as they already know most of their letters, but they really loved it.the train and getting to explore the letter factory kept things very fun."
RZW8ITUJGKPE,"and, as a mom, i know that there is no such thing as too much learning!disclosure i received a copy of this game to facilitate my review, however, all opinions are my own and i was not required to give a positive review."
RCS0CX2W5O2FX,i am giving this item one star for the sole reason that the return address on the item was vibrators written for everyone to see.

R6XID24WBBSRQ,this is my first lipo battery storage bag purchase so i dont have anything to compare it to but it seems to be very well made a good size with a strong velcro seal.
R6XID24WBBSRQ,"i have 2 syma x5 copters, a latraxx alias, a huiying x6058 and a dromida ominus."
R6XID24WBBSRQ,i have several batteries for each copter and it handles them all very easily with much room to spare.
R6XID24WBBSRQ,i believe i have 14 batteries in all and it could easily handle twice that.
R6XID24WBBSRQ,i am very pleased.
R6XID24WBBSRQ,"great service, quality and excellent price."
R6XID24WBBSRQ,thanks!!
R6XID24WBBSRQ,!
R3LKJZ0XU448FM,this was very cheaply made and i was very dissappointed.it was for my grandaughters 3rd birthday and i was almost embarresed tp give it to her.
R1AXH9F4XZ57GM,i cant believe how hard it is to find a really good decent inflatable shark i ordered a bunch of blowup see creatures and the shark was the smallest but was supposed to be the star for my little girls jaws pool birthday party.
R1AXH9F4XZ57GM,and if you look closely youll notice in the photo even that the shark is translucent which i dont get.
R1AXH9F4XZ57GM,this would be good if youre buying it for a child under for anything past that is lame.
R3JLOZ0YBPFF3J,son loves it.
RF0YUBWEIQFNI,this really is nospill.
RF0YUBWEIQFNI,"after years of having to carefully supervise young children with bubbles so that they didnt spill them all over the place, its nice to just let my current young ones sit on the porch and play without needing to hover over them."
RF0YUBWEIQFNI,"when i deliberately knocked this over on its side, nothing came out."
RF0YUBWEIQFNI,"when i turned it upside down, one wand fell out of its slot, but the bubble solution did not come out."
RF0YUBWEIQFNI,the wands are also very sturdy.
RF0YUBWEIQFNI,excellent toy that ill be happy to also buy for nieces and nephews.
RF0YUBWEIQFNI,it is a negative that there is no color choice.
RF0YUBWEIQFNI,"the one we got was half pink and half purple, so not even one of the ones pictured."
RF0YUBWEIQFNI,"im so thrilled about the nospill that i dont care, but i can certainly see that this might be a drawback for many people"
R3IKYENYJEPX1O,i gave this product 3 stars cause this quadrotor has a cheap battery and motors.
R3IKYENYJEPX1O,"but, this is a nice durable quadrotor for beginners."
R3IKYENYJEPX1O,it flies stable with little wind...if you want steady flights i would fly with little to no wind.
R3IKYENYJEPX1O,the flight time for this quadrotor is about 8 to 10 minutes depending on how you fly it.
R3IKYENYJEPX1O,"the battery doesnt last that long, you maybe be able to get about 8 flights out at most."
R3IKYENYJEPX1O,one of the motors will probably give out as well.
R3IKYENYJEPX1O,"but, this is overall good quadrotor for the price."
RR5ZRSE3C3P0N,i bought these as props for a carnival themed photo booth.
RR5ZRSE3C3P0N,i asked my 7 year old to try one on they are tight on me and i wanted to see how it would work on the kids.

RR5ZRSE3C3P0N,the elastic makes them very versatile.

R2HD6PENQFR7D1,"i could see this product lasting for much, much, longer, but there is already a pin sized hole in one corner on arrival."
R2HD6PENQFR7D1,"it doesnt affect the product yet, but over time i expect there will be more.noise is acceptable."
R2HD6PENQFR7D1,it is a bit quieter than my shop vac.
R2HD6PENQFR7D1,it is a bit louder than my hair dryer on high.make sure you tie the strings tight using a square knot or better.
R2HD6PENQFR7D1,i have found that a bow will just slip off causing a potentially dangerous situation.
R2HD6PENQFR7D1,this is just my opinion.
R2HD6PENQFR7D1,"ultimately, safety is up to you."
R2HD6PENQFR7D1,be safe and have fun!

R31OHE72X5BRZ3,"but then you look at each one, and they each have a cute little detail one has a little strawberry on her head, one has a cookie, and the other one an ice cream cone."
R31OHE72X5BRZ3,and the workmanship is incredible.
R31OHE72X5BRZ3,"nice details, hearts on the feet, the little faces on their costumes are well done."

R33CBEBCKVZYFO,the blind bags collectibles are addicting.
R33CBEBCKVZYFO,"accidentally bought 1 at five and below, and i ended up with 17. those collectible lego minifigs are much cooler than the regular lego minifigs."
R33CBEBCKVZYFO,those have their own unique head and accessories.
R33CBEBCKVZYFO,one thing i dont like about this set is the skirts for the female characters excluding maggie.
R33CBEBCKVZYFO,"its hard to put on, and it looks weird when put on.i personally would suggest people to buy those blind bags in the store so you can &34feel&34 them."
R33CBEBCKVZYFO,"otherwise, its almost impossible to collect the set without spending extra buying twins."
R33CBEBCKVZYFO,"i still ended up with 1 twin homer after spending couple hours feeling the blind bags, but i guess its not bad at all."
R3CGWPWTQUFUNI,did not love these.
R3CGWPWTQUFUNI,i was expecting jewel shapes.

R3DVOAIBS3G23Y,the color was quite a bit on the red side for mahogany though.
RF7PJIUIVU0S2,this was a gift for my 3yearold niece who is currently into super heroes.

R2296IYBK1WOGS,the survive the washing machine quite well.

R1Y187I2T0JYEP,much smaller than i thought.

R1KL5JW9QE3J0T,my granddaughter loves this carrier.
R1KL5JW9QE3J0T,all her little hopkins live there!
R3TEWB4JJR4KOD,cute but not well made.
R3TEWB4JJR4KOD,i wasnt expecting a hard helmet but i expected it to last longer than 15 mins.
R3TEWB4JJR4KOD,pulled face shield down off it came.
R3TEWB4JJR4KOD,"sharp edges on helmet, i guess where the plastic punched out in the molding."
R3TEWB4JJR4KOD,this is more of a dollar tree item.
R3TEWB4JJR4KOD,sadly went in trash same day
RB201OJJH9C6,these were a big hit in my party favors.
RB201OJJH9C6,the cupcake shapes are really cute and worked perfectly with my sugar rush theme.
R1YUHA3Y305MUZ,exactly as pictured
RRV3JQFN054EA,"exactly as described, though a bit pricey, it was worth it for a ""last minute"" purchase."
RB1I5KDHBNNDV,"it can be used as a pendant, this is how im using it and i love it!!"
RB1I5KDHBNNDV,i get lots of comments and im asked all the time were i got it!

R3M0DLC8GGAJX4,its hard not to want to run 3 of these together with the aggressor title.
R2OAWOX6J5VDFO,this blue dragon backpack is adorable!
R2OAWOX6J5VDFO,i got it for my niece and i know shell love it.
R2OAWOX6J5VDFO,the green is nice and bright and would definitely stand out in a crowd but my favorite part are the little soft spikes that are down the middle.the seams and zipper appear to be very durable and the inside is even insulated which will be perfect for a snack and juicebox.
R2OAWOX6J5VDFO,there is also a matching leash attachment if thats your thing.
R2OAWOX6J5VDFO,im definitely happy with this product and would recommend it!
R2OAWOX6J5VDFO,i received this backpack at a discount price for my honest review and this backpack is too cute for words to even describe.
R1WZ35P5BS4FBT,balloons kept popping unless so under inflated that they were useless to make anything!
R1WZ35P5BS4FBT,"very frustrating, kids very disappointed."
R1T2IOOO6SK4SK,the pony is easy to put together.
R1T2IOOO6SK4SK,my grandson is a year old and seems to like the pony.
R1T2IOOO6SK4SK,"the pony is very light and i was worried about my grandson getting on and off the pony, but he seems to do ok. the song the pony sings when you press his ear is cute."
REIJO1PER8JOE,granddaughter loved it!

R5MTKK5P1VX67,"i was a little disappointed with the battery because when using on hills, rocks or grassy terrains it drains in about 10 minutes."
R5MTKK5P1VX67,level hard surfaces last a lot longer.
R5MTKK5P1VX67,overall though i recommend this truck.
R31ONMDQKUG90Q,a very great stuffed animal.
R31ONMDQKUG90Q,made to last.

R3UGT82CHJ3LEM,this is so cute.
R3UGT82CHJ3LEM,bought for a friend of mine whos is expecting their first baby.
R1NQC6EG8ZXX3H,the steps rip in the same spot every time we had two and my kids are less than forty pounds so i would hate to see a heavy child try this slide.
R1NQC6EG8ZXX3H,lots of fun until the ladder ripped.
R2K0VIUYN5P2HI,weve had these for a year and my daughter plays with them constantly.
RYDJZ5R42CQ88,i received this item very fast and in very excellent quality.

R39G2L3Q7Z0OSU,too big.
R1UWVI1TFP2VVK,"arrived before estimated delivery date, just as advertised."
R9PIFDMS6PIXM,amazing thing
R1C233S924UNPW,"great hit at the ""crafts table"" for my daughters 5th bday."
R1C233S924UNPW,"used wooden stirrers from starbucks, so several kids could do the stickers at once."
RK1A35N9OIIC1,the count is misleading.
RK1A35N9OIIC1,most of the tablets in the container are small.
R2BFG92E1UWH8S,good
RI9R05MMUW47H,i got this for my 6 year old son and i think i have more fun with it than he does.
RI9R05MMUW47H,my only complaint is that the string isnt very long so we put new string on it.
R210COOZC2GA0R,"i would have enjoyed this a lot more if the ""volcano"" would stay in one place and not flip around every time i try to reset it."
R210COOZC2GA0R,it wont let me reset the bubbles without flipping the volcano over and letting out all of the red bubbles.
R210COOZC2GA0R,"when i finally get the volcano set up right, theres only about 3 seconds of ""eruption"" i was rather disappointed with this."
R27CTOVJR8VEK7,my 5 year old loved this doll.
R27CTOVJR8VEK7,it look exactly like the picture.
R26VZ9722Z4AAG,really hard to turn
RVJUBCFFQTDSN,"i loved it, but i broke it right away when a few pieces hit the floor."
R352WPNJ4V4KVD,it is quite bigger than it looks.
R352WPNJ4V4KVD,the quality is really good for its price.
R352WPNJ4V4KVD,"i read many negative comments about chairs, but mine are perfect."
R352WPNJ4V4KVD,"it gets a little trial and error to get a grip on how to sit on the chair, but once you know it its quite amazing hint the trick is placing your body weight as back in the chair as possible and lean back."
R352WPNJ4V4KVD,the cup holders have inflated seam grip so you wont spill your drinks.
R352WPNJ4V4KVD,all in all its a great product for an amazing price.
RN6HUSBUL3Q33,it didnt work so we returned it.
RFYK0TFHGTP9M,works great and does the job well.
RFYK0TFHGTP9M,"while the interface could use some improvements, i appreciate the intelligence and the level of control that i have with this."
RFYK0TFHGTP9M,i highly recommend this for model airplane enthusiasts.
RCKGX5NB6XR1P,i recently bought this doll for my 11 year old.
RCKGX5NB6XR1P,i thought the clothes were very cute and matched the styles they wear on the tv series on netflix.
RCKGX5NB6XR1P,the only thing i didnt like was the material they made the doll out of.
RCKGX5NB6XR1P,i thought it was flimsy.
RCKGX5NB6XR1P,i expected it to be more sturdy like the monster high dolls since they used the same molds for these dolls.
RCKGX5NB6XR1P,they are not articulated either.
R1USQBPYVG1V34,very helpful in teaching my kids spanish.
R12A4CT523FX8E,wonderful colors in these marbles.
R1VG2WP5WWC82E,hard to breakthats all otherwise fine and fun!

R1MMW5WX8LHXA5,i took a part a circuit board with no issues using this thing.
R1ITUTIGBM95HZ,love it

R17NV66I2SXHFF,gave it as a gift.
R17NV66I2SXHFF,love the wide brim!
R2MH8C2K7TB1OY,"my daughter loves anything horse, and this is no exception."
R196QV9J3IYE89,"wasnt what we thought, too short, just a deceiving picture...doesnt hold attention because not long enough...i guess i didnt read the measurements"
R12OLCN4ITROPF,theyre tiny.
R12OLCN4ITROPF,was expecting bigger
R32CFJY8EOC09F,"some dust & scratchs in te package, the product inside was a little dirty"

R12FWKF0X3PLWA,"nice set of batteries, the parallel charger works fine.just be careful with the voltage and amps provided, monitor them as they get charged and youll not have any problems."
RHO7MMQQ4QI52,fun
R3KCT12L0R8DHE,my six year old & three year old grandkids absolutely love this pool.
R3KCT12L0R8DHE,its especially great for the three year old since hes a little too small for more water.
R3KCT12L0R8DHE,he loves to run at it & slip his legs over & splash.
R3KCT12L0R8DHE,they use it almost every day!
R38CVZDLV673HU,it was okay
R1B4L4CUFV9IPC,weird looking guy but my 2.5 yo loves him.
R1B4L4CUFV9IPC,small skinny cuddle cat.
R1B4L4CUFV9IPC,seems to hold up well and washed well.
R2PKTE7E1TE9MJ,so adorable.
R2JQDIJ5CBL2DH,this is more for the adults and it is even more hilarious than the original play set.
R1PRJWHWH32M17,this is the third aurora brand stuffed animal we have bought.
R1PRJWHWH32M17,all have been great quality and have held up to multiple washings and all the rough play that 3 kiddos can dish out!
R1PRJWHWH32M17,i cant say that for many of the other stuffed animals weve had around here!
R17ZIG51OYHAJ6,so fun for everyone111
R3QYRU7XQYN0E6,"it was supposed to arrive friday 828 but as of today, its just now in tennessee."
R3QYRU7XQYN0E6,"if it ever arrives, im sure my 2 year old nephew will enjoy it his birthday party was this past saturday."

R38T2EI7WKHYI1,great
RDPS40GY5XXE1,kids love it
R1PTK7HDY9JE6V,"my great neice loves her first ""pete."""
R26WJOIJVPJNGA,very durable pinanta.
R26WJOIJVPJNGA,held up very well under a constant beating.
R26WJOIJVPJNGA,we did not utilize the pull string aspect.
R26WJOIJVPJNGA,we wanted the kids to do it the old fashioned way.
R26WJOIJVPJNGA,worth the money.
RRQ2XOICO8JWI,love it
RBFLW6T8S43E6,worthy followup to the classic game.
RBFLW6T8S43E6,"a d&dlite experience without all the polyhedrals, character sheets, and the like.some minis would be nice, as would a bifold board, but i dont have any issue with the heavy stock the components are printed from."
RBFLW6T8S43E6,"the tiny cards dont bother me, because they fit neatly into the boxs tray as well as most any small organizer.consider 35 years inflation this game still runs about $13."
RBFLW6T8S43E6,"youll get your moneys worth out of it now just as you did then, unless youre an absolute purist who insists on the original version."
RBFLW6T8S43E6,i like that the game no longer dominates an entire table.amazon doesnt do halfstars.
RBFLW6T8S43E6,"i rate it a 6 out of 10, but i wouldnt say &34its okay&34, i like it."
RBFLW6T8S43E6,"so, it gets 4 stars on this site."
R1YO9OST0YWFX0,my son is enjoying his new magic tricks
R3UTJD5ATJM6VK,love it
R39124W67ZBTLW,i like it
R3EMZVJ3VF5BBM,"greatings, i just go my pinkie pie plushie, and everything looks like the one on the picture!"
R3EMZVJ3VF5BBM,"but the tail feels fragile and floppy.but besides that, everything is fine"
R3D3TJY92RCDF4,cute and fit well.
R25J05DYNNP5BZ,"this is a huge hit in my game group, it hits the table multiple time every monday like clockwork."
R25J05DYNNP5BZ,this is a must by
R2FZOVMG1MHIQ,i bought this for my granddaughters eighth birthdaythe sound is great.
R3417OJ3MYF3A1,i really enjoy the dc multiverse line of figures and i was very excited to see they made a batman figure based on the adam west batman from the 60s tv show.
R3417OJ3MYF3A1,the figure has all the same points of articulation as the others in the multiverse line but this isnt just another batman repaint.
R3417OJ3MYF3A1,"the ultity belt, head and cape are all far different from other batmans that have came so far."
R3417OJ3MYF3A1,if youre a fan of batman or action figures and can find this for the right price i would definitely pick it up.
R18HQ8G1ZEBB2F,this is nice float for relaxing and staying above the water.
R18HQ8G1ZEBB2F,"it will not, necessarily, keep you completely dry but is very comfortable and stable on the water."
R18HQ8G1ZEBB2F,the weakest point is the connection between the body of the float and the arms.
R18HQ8G1ZEBB2F,i have purchased 6 or so of these and they have all torn at that point within a year of purchase.
R18HQ8G1ZEBB2F,if you are an adult with no young children at home this float may last a long time as long as you get on and off with care.
R18HQ8G1ZEBB2F,"if you have kids, be aware that that the arms are where most kids want to pull themselves up from."
R18HQ8G1ZEBB2F,this almost ensures early collapse of your float.
R3RIHUN20DYYHY,best buddy
RTWB6M7LKP3LG,"just as announced, really good dice"
R2R887I789Z63B,functionality is good.
R2R887I789Z63B,"the only problem i have is the sliding to erase part, its so tough to slide back and forth."
R2R887I789Z63B,i am the adult and i have the problem sometime.
R2R887I789Z63B,my 2 years old cannot do it by herself.
R2R887I789Z63B,she has to come to me for help all the time.
R182VNFBTPEQWO,"no instructions, random named items in it, only a couple thigns seemed to grow out fo the whole package and never got that big at all."
R3SFVOZ5HCKCHH,got this as a joke gift for my dad for fathers day.
R3SFVOZ5HCKCHH,my whole family laughed at how funny the packaging is there are a lot of puns and jokes.
R1ZJUTNCQ03C4Y,does not erase very well.
R1ZJUTNCQ03C4Y,have to slide a few times for better erasing.
R2Q966PDV0S9BW,these were perfect for the beach.
R2Q966PDV0S9BW,the only improvement they could make would be a drawstring closure for the top.
R3MVC8YQ1OI68M,got it before delivery said it was going to he hear and it works great lasts along time before having to charge it up
R11I8V93I3KMJ4,these are great teaching tools...my son enjoys playing games with them.. they are sturdy and made very well!!

R3TZXFOOTT4ZBW,my 6 year old loves these skates.
R3TZXFOOTT4ZBW,i bought them a little big so she can wear them longer.
R3TZXFOOTT4ZBW,the only thing i didnt like is how to unbuckle them.
R3TZXFOOTT4ZBW,my daughter has trouble unbuckling them so i have to help her every time.
R255H8QNVMPZGU,"huge size, very happy!"

R7O6C922XY7F2,was missing a few pieces.
R7O6C922XY7F2,no directions included.
R7O6C922XY7F2,box was smashed.
R7O6C922XY7F2,my soninlaw went online and found the directions.
R7O6C922XY7F2,they plan to contact the lego company in hopes of getting the pieces they are missing.
R1ETQQTJPATRA1,dont waste your money.
R1ETQQTJPATRA1,"the colors are so pale, they are hard to see."
R1ETQQTJPATRA1,"definitely &34water&34colorsthough it might not be a portable, i will i had just bought a dry erase board."
R1ETQQTJPATRA1,"would send it back, but threw the box away before letting my granddaughters play with it."

R1O4T2APG37IJ2,pieces are thick and perfect for 34 year olds......
R3BPRTFVD5ZGBL,expecting a variety when i purchased 2 at once.
R3BPRTFVD5ZGBL,received 2 plain beige ones.
R2JWCFQKI376S9,"perfect, the boys who attended our party were between 28 years old."
R2JWCFQKI376S9,"everyone had a favorite item inside, and they all love their new cup."
RA9YNSROWGDQ7,my three year old son has really enjoyed this train set over the last week.
RA9YNSROWGDQ7,"the pieces are nicely weighted and detailed die cast  plastic, not steel, but still good quality."
RA9YNSROWGDQ7,"the size is smaller than most train sets, but to an extent it adds to the appeal  it is easy to movecarry and small enough to take in the car or put in a bag for travel."
RA9YNSROWGDQ7,it can be put together in any arrangement and moves smoothly.
RA9YNSROWGDQ7,my one complaint is that the connectors are very malleable and easily damaged.
RA9YNSROWGDQ7,the train still fits together but i dont think it will hold up to long term use without incurring damage.
RA9YNSROWGDQ7,disclaimer i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
R1NAUN8BCLGEXW,the table and chairs work pretty well for us.
R1NAUN8BCLGEXW,"the light weight of the table and chairs can be a good thing, but also a bad thing."
R1NAUN8BCLGEXW,it is easy for my almost two year old to pull the chair out or push it in my himself when he is not sitting in it.
R1NAUN8BCLGEXW,"however, the chairs are so light that they tip fairly easily if hes leaning to far one way."
R1NAUN8BCLGEXW,"overall though, these will work just fine for what we wanted them for, a table for him to color or eat snacks at."
R11ANKD2R20DBK,every one can have fun with this.
R1XNXHFCRWEPYR,i was very excited when i saw the commercial and hope to use it in one of my lessons with the kids i worked with.
R1XNXHFCRWEPYR,"only one of the two ozobots worked black, the white does not do anything."
R1XNXHFCRWEPYR,my fellow teacher and i did all the instructions carefully but still nothing.
R1XNXHFCRWEPYR,"even the one working did not follow the ""commands. """
R1XNXHFCRWEPYR,im disappointed for i think that this is a great product.

R11AL7GBG6259C,cant wait to see who ends up with it.
R20WMZJEVU3UE6,so real and so cute.
R20WMZJEVU3UE6,just love her.
R20WMZJEVU3UE6,her name is ryka.
R20WMZJEVU3UE6,"i named her that because my niece had a baby boy that looked so much like this doll when he was born and his name is ryker, so i thought ryka would be a good fit in honor of my niece and her baby boy."
R2QNZNOTCYGQNC,cant see through the paper for tracing!
R2QNZNOTCYGQNC,returning immediately.
R2QNZNOTCYGQNC,"even when we took the light pad into a dark room, there was barely enough light to shine through and enable tracing."
R2QNZNOTCYGQNC,i guess i got what i paid for...
RNIDVSJ9Q9YXL,"good , charges quick."
R2K1RNVES3RFO6,"great, love it for a good learning tool arrived right away, very happy."
R1FQNMF3MFHZNV,"although the dinosaurs dont necessarily come in the exact colors pictured here, i thought the funky colors were cute and whimsical."
R1FQNMF3MFHZNV,perfect little plastic figures.
R1T89L5BGRKAFF,"not bad, decent sized but kind of awkward on the clips."
R1T89L5BGRKAFF,there were funnier clips
R14MH9TXKD5IEL,grandson loved the plane
R3G0S37HWYYXRL,sandys house and ocean cruiser is a lot of fun for the kiddos!
R3G0S37HWYYXRL,my 4 year old daughter sits and plays with the set for hours.
R3G0S37HWYYXRL,"theres so much for sandy to do drive the boat, go down the slide, eat or cook in her kitchen, sleep in her bed, use the bathtub, swim with a dolphin, get dressed, and more!"
R3G0S37HWYYXRL,she also talks about what she does as she is in each different part of the house.i like that sandy has a goal other than just fashion and fun.
R3G0S37HWYYXRL,"shes a marine biologist i believe, and she talks about learning about the sea and the sea creatures.i would highly suggest this playset for any little kids with imaginations."
R3G0S37HWYYXRL,my daughter has already requested the other sets!note i was provided this product free of charge in exchange of this review.
R3G0S37HWYYXRL,all words and opinions are mine.
R1EJKIUBX9MTJO,first one was broke right out of the box... the replacement is good... hard to find extra batteries.
R1EJKIUBX9MTJO,flys well.. not my first drone... good price..
RVTERHO2HULUJ,disappointed.... the bank was sent without the lid.
RVTERHO2HULUJ,i ordered my 5 yr old somethings for finishing his first week of school.

R18NVQHKRRAO1C,its an okay battery.
R18NVQHKRRAO1C,not great.
R18NVQHKRRAO1C,the downside to it is that the connectors it comes with i use the traxxas plug fits way too tight.
R18NVQHKRRAO1C,i can barely get it unplugged.
R18NVQHKRRAO1C,ok for the price though.
R2UISTCRKH2U5M,"these are very sturdy, my boys 5 & 4 love them."

R2UNRG2Z4J8D9K,but as long as that is kept in mind then there are no problems with this product.
R2XZ843WUTRIOM,im curious to see my granddaughter play with this.
R2XZ843WUTRIOM,from an adult perspective having never watched the tv show it is &34fun and frustrating&34.
R2XZ843WUTRIOM,its a really cool multispaceship design with large soft plastic pieces that are usually easy to use.
R2XZ843WUTRIOM,however some parts are so hard to operate that you are left wondering if you are doing something blindingly obvious wrong.
R2XZ843WUTRIOM,for example the front window opens and pivots up but it requires at least at first so much force that you think you are going to break it or assume no child could actually do that the instructions are actually confusing and my guess is that a child who has watched the show might actually be able to operate the ship easier than an adult.the &34xvr system&34 seems designed to frustrate a child.
R2XZ843WUTRIOM,"an adult should be able to figure out how to detach it and attach it again but i could see this baffling many children.rating this toy is very difficult, aspects of it are a &341&34 terrible and other aspects are a &345&34 excellent."
R2XZ843WUTRIOM,my guess is that the average young child will really enjoy it with moments of severe frustration.
R2XZ843WUTRIOM,it says &343&34.
R2XZ843WUTRIOM,"my guess is that the age range that will enjoy this is roughly 3 to 7 years old specifically if they are a fan of the show.the lights are great!only &34miles&34 is included most likely your child will want you to buy more sets to go with this.it uses six triple a batteries luckily included, hopefully they dont burn out too quickly."
R3GGELGKMEEJV2,great game for the whovian in your family!
R2LYSAARKEPK6O,"sturdy toy, built well."

R2CQVXJE7CQWFG,the design on the glasses in the listing does not match the ones i received.
R2CQVXJE7CQWFG,"i decided to keep them anyway, to avoid the hassle of returning them."
R2CQVXJE7CQWFG,i have used the glasses less than 2 months and already one of the decals is starting to flake off.
R2CQVXJE7CQWFG,i hand wash and immediately dry  never use a dishwasher since i dont have one  so there is no reason other than bad quality to explain the defect.
R2CQVXJE7CQWFG,too expensive to be turning into junk after a few weeks of use!
ROBY1UZXY1CR4,i have mixed feeling about this game set.it is nice that it has 30 levels of chess which is the main reason we were interested in it.
ROBY1UZXY1CR4,"chess is the game my girls love to play and being able to play against the machine is so nice.the other games are okay, but the chess side of things is the main focus of the board set.individual pieces are super small, and you cant carry the board and pieces in the case which means one or the other always has a way of being left somewhere.overall, as a travel game, this is a nice set."
ROBY1UZXY1CR4,word of caution to keep the pieces away from little ones as they are small enough to choke on.
ROBY1UZXY1CR4,"batteries are not included and the system does use them up fairly quickly.depending on what you are looking for in a portable travel chess set, and the age of your children..this is a nice game with limits.promotional or discounted product provided for review."
RQJCFNT5SGDT,"these are nice tires for the price, theyre soft and hook up great in rough off road terrain."

R21FXSH18A43V6,shes great at identifying the sounds.
R21FXSH18A43V6,the games a little cheap and some of the sounds can be hard to determine but its was well worth buying for the hours and hours of entertainment its provided.
R21FXSH18A43V6,my 4 year old also still enjoys playing with it.
R21FXSH18A43V6,its the only game we can all play as a family!

R1VGYFW4EF551W,"she loved playing with the little food it comes with, putting it on the customized tray and then baking it."
R1VGYFW4EF551W,the oven asks you to set the time to a specific number so it will hopefully help her learn her numbers.
R1VGYFW4EF551W,it sings and makes sound effects.
R1VGYFW4EF551W,its fun to fry the egg on top.

R1URV2GEK20RI6,we hit one not sharp rock the first time floating down the river and there is a hole big enough to put two fingers in it.
R23SD6YO9YRZWS,this is a great game depending on the group you play it with.
R23SD6YO9YRZWS,regardless if you you are a bioshock fan or not it is a great game experience.
R23SD6YO9YRZWS,it was a tense back and forth the entire game.
R23SD6YO9YRZWS,i still havent played it enough times to figure out if both sides are balanced.i really need to give it more plays but its hard to get a 2 or 4 player game exceeding 2 hours to the table in my game group.
RWEJ0WVTAU0BM,very poor quality for the price.
RWEJ0WVTAU0BM,"flimsy plastic, and very small."

RU72G7QXMQR8B,"as a fan of gravity falls, i was pleased to see some accompanying merchandise, especially of two of my favorite characters."
RU72G7QXMQR8B,i thought the price tag appropriate for two figures several inches in size and promptly purchased them.
RU72G7QXMQR8B,"however, once they arrived, i noticed that the quality of the figures was lacking."
RU72G7QXMQR8B,"the figure molds themselves are very cute and are proportionate to the show, but the paint job, especially on mabel, was sloppy  theres a bit of skincolored paint in her eye, splotches on her teeth and legs, and most glaringly, a blotch of paint on her left cheek where you can clearly see a stopped brushstroke, and the skin is two different colors above and below the stroke."
RU72G7QXMQR8B,"waddles seems to have fared better, most likely because his paint job was simpler."
RU72G7QXMQR8B,"i dont think kids would mind minor defects like these, so if youre purchasing these for a child to play with, then i wouldnt worry about it."
RU72G7QXMQR8B,"also, i am a newinbox collector for the most part, and was pleased to see that the packaging was display worthy  just some simple but tasteful background art from the show.ultimately, though i was disappointed at the sloppy paint job, im sufficiently happy with the molds, the box art and just the fact of being able to own some figures from the show that i still feel reasonably satisfied with my purchase."
R3CAMCGCSAWW4Q,fun and takes great photo
R1I36SHXHWP1JX,the car itself seems pretty durable in the hands of a 5 year old.
R1I36SHXHWP1JX,the remote and antenna are a little on the cheap side.
R340MDBADY2P86,my grandchildren love them.
R340MDBADY2P86,they are a traditional activity for our week at the beech.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,my 18 month old granddaughter was very excited as soon as we took this out of the box.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,she immediately started putting toys on top of &34her&34 table  as obviously this was for her and not for anyone else lol!
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,she has had a little difficulty getting onto the chairs properly.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,she is 32&34 tall but her butt level is lower than the chair seat so she tries to &34scoot&34 onto the chair and can only get a small part of her bum onto it.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,then as she tries to &34scoot&34onto the chair it pushes away from her.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,the chairs are very light and even on an area rug move when she tries to get in them.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,she has already learned to kind of half sit on the chair and wait for grandma & granddad to lift her the rest of the way onto the chair.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,her feet do not touch the floor when seated but she slides off the chair and hasnt had a problem on the dismount ha ha.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,"i think another inch or so of growth and the problem will be resolved.my yorkie also loves the table as when my granddaughter is having lunch or her snack, he is right in feeding range  she does the one bite for you  one bite for the dog eating method  and they both enjoy this immensely."
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,"i was going to try and tell her &34dont feed the dog&34 but she has so much fun doing it i just cant tell her no i would have never let my kids do this, but grandkids, that is a whole different story.anyway, this is a nice little table that doesnt take a lot of room and is easy to move inside and outside the house."
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,works well as a play surface and can also be used for mealssnacks.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,i was going to get a little tikes picnic table but decided to try this instead and am glad i did.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,picnic table wouldnt have been nearly as portable and would have taken a lot more space.
R30PJ9XUHFTY5D,the two chairs fit completely under the table when not is use so great for anyone who wants a play table for their toddler with limited space.thanks.
RC7PGFQ4HQE2J,my daughter loves these
R164M2OQA0277O,this is a great competitive game that uses both offensive and defensive moves to win.
R5IEUM9HTYTAB,im very disappointed as this coloring book looks and feels like it is cheaper than a dollar store coloring book and i payed $6 .
R5IEUM9HTYTAB,i want to try and get my money back as this is not good quality and only has a few pages.
R1P3O7P6SG3XL,avenger fans will love it
R3SUBWAE94HHSQ,it was a great deal
R18G18MF4EJ0EY,bought for my inhome daycare.
R18G18MF4EJ0EY,kids of all ages loved this for years!
R251OSIVCCB1GE,my goddaughter loved it!
R251OSIVCCB1GE,!
R21IORODV189ZL,i bought this for a 1year olds bday whose dad loves deer and is wanting her to love them too.
R21IORODV189ZL,it was a hit!
R21IORODV189ZL,so cute.
R21IORODV189ZL,"although its a little big for her to enjoy at this age, she can grow into playing on it."
R21IORODV189ZL,super cute and i got if for a great price.
R21IORODV189ZL,would purchase again!
R2GJ22OCX46PGC,arrived on time but very cheap plastic.
R394CN0I0ZLMYV,"i have 2 boys that are just over the game age range 35 years, and they still loved it."
R394CN0I0ZLMYV,the boys think that the trucks are great and enjoy the adventures of blaze.
R394CN0I0ZLMYV,"as an engineering grad, i absolutely loved the stem concepts taught to my kids  both the boys and the girls  with this game."
R394CN0I0ZLMYV,"we have 2 controllers, so they are able to play sidebyside."
R394CN0I0ZLMYV,"engineering at a young age, whats not to love?"
R2S1NOOBN9GNXW,i love the color magna doodle!
R2S1NOOBN9GNXW,!
ROSWD61O14SK3,nephew was super excited to start on this set.
RB3N91DSF0YS0,stickers were coming off after few days of getting it.
RB3N91DSF0YS0,bad quality.
R2HE0JOSAQ74WS,"good for the price, but other then that, not really a fan of it shoddy work."
R326BP0CECK0HE,"i brought this item for my grandaugther,and she loves it."
R3N1AVSCBUZKB4,this is awesome.
RMX7ZYQZG2SIN,i got it to go with my kirito figma.
RMX7ZYQZG2SIN,the only issue i have with it is how the sheath for the rapiers attach to her outfit.
RMX7ZYQZG2SIN,the nub lack for a better term is too big for the hole and i feel like it stretches it out.
RQ7Q0VE75ZK4C,love this paint set
R2PRB5R87T7X0K,"so cute, works well in the pool and on the floor."
R2PRB5R87T7X0K,also well made.
R2L47EZ1F5062D,fairly good delivery.
R2L47EZ1F5062D,great price.
R2L47EZ1F5062D,average quality of product.
R2L47EZ1F5062D,i would buy again strictly based on the delivery process.
RLV0JMTI1FFES,an amazing doll great fashion and beautiful face
R1LPS8YXLWXR4H,very affordable.
R1LPS8YXLWXR4H,all worked as advertised!
R1LPS8YXLWXR4H,!
R3117S4Y4OJ6ON,"while i havent actually had the wagon out to use with my granddaughter, it looks like it will be just what i wanted and much better built that some of the less expensive ones i looked at."
R3117S4Y4OJ6ON,it is a little bigger than i expected but will last for her to grow.
R3117S4Y4OJ6ON,"the canopy didnt arrive with our original order and when we notified the wagon store, they responded immediately and had shipped the canopy the next day."
RQLJI6BAB9XNF,best activity in the world and from old to young !
RQLJI6BAB9XNF,will always keep some on hand !
R8EXGPMMB5GRG,"everyone compliments this, and i agree it is cool."
R8EXGPMMB5GRG,however it ticks really loudly and it stopped working soon after i got it.
R8EXGPMMB5GRG,"it still makes the ticking sound, but the hands just stop moving for a few hours at a time."
R8EXGPMMB5GRG,"i didnt buy it to use as my actual clock anyway so im not that upset about it, the time isnt what other people pay attention to either.my main complaint is the strange irremovable residue that was left by the sticker that was on the face of the clock."
R8EXGPMMB5GRG,makes it look dirty and clouds the view.
R8EXGPMMB5GRG,overall it is pretty poor quality product
R16XZZ8TGSMUG7,"lots of fun, some bullets trickier than others"
R1XQFXADQ28EZV,this doll is so pretty!
R1XQFXADQ28EZV,she is about 11 inches tall and her dress is gorgeous.
R1XQFXADQ28EZV,shes well made and durable and so is her dress.
R1XQFXADQ28EZV,my niece has switched dresses between the two disney decendants dolls that she has and they did fit.
R1XQFXADQ28EZV,"i will absolutely be ordering more from this line, they are so pretty and well made, and my niece likes them more than her barbies."
R23A7EEASQLF73,this game is fun to play  with family or friends  as long as everyone has a good sense of humor about language or other offensive material like drawings.
R23A7EEASQLF73,"we played it this weekend with family and have played it with friends before and it gets a great laugh, its competitive and gives everyone a chance to play unlike some other games that can skip people repeatedly."
R2C8VZQFQ9CYF0,so cute!
R2C8VZQFQ9CYF0,sturdy enough for a childs toy.
R2C8VZQFQ9CYF0,neatly hand painted in lively bright colors.
R2NSEHA2TDBP1N,ok
R170PHNIM2OOVK,"the print on this canvas is so hard to see that i have to give up trying to paint these paintings, asking for a refund."
R1EQ49CHATRK24,voice is really low hard to hear but my niece loved it!
R3MY34FGU3ESNY,all of the melissa & doug puzzles were well made and happily accepted by my grandson.
R3MY34FGU3ESNY,that was the most important review.
R3KL2O9ILCX2R4,simple instructions.
R3KL2O9ILCX2R4,great use of mobility and eye skills
R27BG1N5BAG1R1,who doesnt like this!!
R27BG1N5BAG1R1,if i ever have to replace the elf i will go to hobby lobby to get a new one!
R27BG1N5BAG1R1,they are sooo much cuter than this one!
R27BG1N5BAG1R1,but its fun!
R24ZDJWNJMIDBC,love love love.
R24ZDJWNJMIDBC,time consuming to assemble but it was worth it.
R24ZDJWNJMIDBC,well made and the kids love it!
R1SE14HNYNJXCE,great for the price
R7JMNU065YQPB,we got the shadow launcher from buzz campaigns to test and it was super easy to get out of the package and its fun.
R7JMNU065YQPB,"however, the truck barely rolls."
R7JMNU065YQPB,we tried it on hard flooring and the wheels just spin like crazy.
R7JMNU065YQPB,on carpet it didnt do much better.
R7JMNU065YQPB,it cant back up at all either.
R7JMNU065YQPB,the helicopter flew well at first but after paying with our fit two days the propeller started to come away from the motor and it took a lot to figure out what was wrong.
R7JMNU065YQPB,now every time we want to fly it we have to make sure the propeller is pushed into place and after a few minutes of flying it requires fixing.
R13DOHH5P7MJ5Z,bought for my 10 year old great niece.
R13DOHH5P7MJ5Z,she loved it.
R38T9EWKDROR2G,great game
R3AMJLOPE4P7NL,"only because even though the cutout is articulated, it does not stay in any position except hanging straight down."
R3AMJLOPE4P7NL,"for the price, its okay."
R3AMJLOPE4P7NL,good size.
R3AMJLOPE4P7NL,could be thicker.
R3AMJLOPE4P7NL,nothing to hang it with.
R3LGQS8YH9ZB7R,ok i did get this for the all father.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,videoide20d26d420fd5088037c6a07305dbf3f techege toys fire engine is a pretty neat toy.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,it has full lights and sounds and even looks like a fire truck.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,the lights go through out the whole truck and lights in bright multi colors.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,even the headlights light up and shine bright in front of it to make it more realistic.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,the hose on top you can also move around.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,this fire engine operates off 3 aa batteries which is secure on the bottom of the truck which does need a small screwdriver to open up.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,that is something i do really like in toys this way little kids cant open it on their own and get to the batteries.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,there is an onoff switch on the bottom so its not constantly on.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,once you do turn it on it moves and has sound as if its a real fire truck making its way to a fire!
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,i do have to admit it is a little loud so i do wish there was a volume control however the sound completes the toy and it wouldnt be the same without it so i wouldnt change it at all.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,i even had a friend on the phone when my son was playing with it and he thought it was a real fire truck outside my house.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,i also like that as its moving if it hits into anything in its path it will backup and go a different way as many times as needed so you dont need to worry about it hitting into a wall and having to chase after it to turn it around.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,i am very impressed with this toy.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,it is high quality and sturdy.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,i find it very safe for kids to use.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,recommended age is 3 and up which i think is perfect.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,both my kids actually enjoy it and wont give it up.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,i feel 100 comfortable recommending this toy to others.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,i received this for free in exchange for my honest review.
R369SMPPQ3JWD9,i was not paid or sponsored for my opinions all thoughts reflected in this review are my own.
R2HU1PBDESJX09,mi kid enjoyed it.
R2EEQ9JG4W3143,great game
R15BJ3EZ9OTGQ2,excellent.
R3NY58XH2BALO8,this was a fantastic purchase!
R3NY58XH2BALO8,bought it over a year ago and it has held together extremely well solid and built to last.
R3NY58XH2BALO8,my 4 year old soon to be 5 and my 2 year old can both ride this very well.
R3NY58XH2BALO8,ive also had older kids that are much too big for it take it for a ride and it has not warped or broken.
R3NY58XH2BALO8,the lean to steer is a must have!
R3NY58XH2BALO8,the kids picked up the concept right away before i could even explain it and it is so much easier for them control than the turn the handle bars design.
R3NY58XH2BALO8,if you are on the fence about the lean to steer dont be.
R3NY58XH2BALO8,ive seen all the kids in my neighborhood use this design with great success even a 2 year old that rides the scooter like an x games master.
R3NY58XH2BALO8,"most of the other kids where we live have the micro mini, which is the same style scooter as this and looks just as good, but is much more expensive."
R3NY58XH2BALO8,"i went with the radio flyer, and not only is it easier to distinguish which scooter is mine at the playground, i am able to buy two of these for the same price as one micro mini."
R3NY58XH2BALO8,"would highly recommend to anyone, even if your child is very small."
R3NY58XH2BALO8,"it took my boys a while of playing with it before they got really good with it, but they had fun the whole time even before they could really ride it."
R3NY58XH2BALO8,fantastic buy!
R3NY58XH2BALO8,"and the kids love it, not to mention the convenience of having my 4 year old be able to keep up with me when walking quickly somewhere, or running errands."
R3NY58XH2BALO8,"thanks radio flyer, we love this scooter!"
R1BPYYWRW1YDF7,items were sent on time and packaged well.
R1BPYYWRW1YDF7,all items were as described.

R1BPYYWRW1YDF7,thank you!
RV0E9S4MRPWJZ,great
R2RAQKATCV4DDA,great costumer service.. unfortunately they didnt fit my daughter.

R3DG70LK3ZH448,"i love it, is amazing"
R2N1FIHFYIC1Z6,fun
R2YY7TFCGU9KK0,my song loves it.
RLST8UTB0JN1P,"an okay game,"
R2VREI96Y5ZT8U,i been looking for this for a long time.
R2VREI96Y5ZT8U,the lego set are nice but with this i can use my imagination.
R28WY5R7K31CA9,love it
R15TVURFNC9THX,amazing!
R15TVURFNC9THX,we have not had one wildlife fatality since this was installed over a month ago.
R15TVURFNC9THX,"we had squirrels, birds, voles, and chipmunks all meet a very wet and sad end in our pool when we first opened it."
R15TVURFNC9THX,i am so happy to say that this addition has kept out pool wildlife free.
R15TVURFNC9THX,a must for pools that have a lot of foliage around them!
R5GF1XV810CVO,very cheap but decent.
R5GF1XV810CVO,"the front legs are bent to the left, and the back paws are nubs."
R5GF1XV810CVO,the yellow rings on the ears and legs are wonky.
R10WRJ2EG2GQG8,"easy to use, no surprises."
R17TUI2TA95LP9,k2 is a slow moving game that requires patience and the ability to balance movement points and acclimatization together.
R17TUI2TA95LP9,"once you understand all the technicalities of the game, you can then appreciate whats required to do well."
R17TUI2TA95LP9,"being a race, one might think speed up the mountain is most important."
R17TUI2TA95LP9,wrong!
R17TUI2TA95LP9,keeping your climbers alive while gradually moving up is more important.
R17TUI2TA95LP9,the tension builds as climbers get closer to the top.
R17TUI2TA95LP9,i can see how experience at mountain climbing made the production of this game possible.
R17TUI2TA95LP9,"for anyone whos climber gets to the top and is still alive at the end of the game, i say take a bow!"
R17TUI2TA95LP9,thats how difficult the game is.
R17TUI2TA95LP9,"it doesnt bog down from analysis paralysis, because every player is figuring out their strategy at the same time."
R17TUI2TA95LP9,it took my group of 3 players one hour to play.
R17TUI2TA95LP9,we all felt exhausted at the end!
R17TUI2TA95LP9,"i will say it was fun, enough to give it 5 stars."
R17TUI2TA95LP9,"if your gaming group has a lot of patience, you will enjoy k2."
R17TUI2TA95LP9,"also, all the mechanics seem to work very well."
R17TUI2TA95LP9,"before buying this game, make sure you watch a few tutorials, and get a good idea if its the kind of game you would like."
R2AMALO86PJZZD,yes everything i hoped it would be
R2EUGNIXGOHOGO,cute.
R2EUGNIXGOHOGO,didnt realize you have to hold them to the light and something colorful when using.
R2EUGNIXGOHOGO,they do work though.
R2EUGNIXGOHOGO,thanks
RB2GB6L9R8HT9,awesome!
R1YA5D1FL532BW,great bathtime or indooroutdoor doll.
R1YA5D1FL532BW,my 18 month old loves this doll as it can go anywhere with her.
R1YA5D1FL532BW,and it can sit on a chair at my daughters little table.
R1YA5D1FL532BW,my kiddo loves it.
R2J2P2I9VZAM1J,very small and son has had tons of fun.
R2J2P2I9VZAM1J,came with replacement blades but we have not needed them despite many hours of flying.
RBRRFQGRJPVSA,item come in full set and no damage.
RBRRFQGRJPVSA,fast delivery as well.
R3FYOD841LA5Y2,"these floats are awesome, they keep you afloat, but allow you to be close to or somewhat in the water."
RBN8IQ7Z7F69S,very pretty well made doll.
RBN8IQ7Z7F69S,this pretty lady is well made and comes with cute accessories.
R19GX93ZLFA41T,it had two holes in it and wouldnt hold helium.
R3OFLDRPBJG9XP,very good.
R2UUHU5OEIJ6M,superior spinning battle top beats almost every top we have.
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,this is my daughters first 18&34 doll.
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,she absolutely loves her as i knew she would.
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,she is a very pretty little doll and her hair seems nice and silky and the cloths seem nice.
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,the velcro on the cape doesnt want to stay together but thats not a huge issue for us.
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,we had only had the doll out of the box for a few hours and i already began to worry about the dolls head breaking or falling off.
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,"its great that her head can move side to side, and up and down, but her head rotates all the way around, very easily i might add."
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,all we have to do is pick her up or carry her and the dolls head will just turn around.
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,makes me think of the exorcist when i see it.
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,"i had thought about getting her the elsa doll for christmas, but now i am a little on the fence about it."
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,i guess we will see what happens with this one in the coming months.
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,"i would have given more stars, but the freaky head worries me.update we purchased elsa for christmas and her head does not turn quite so easily so we may have just gotten a defective annal."
R10NIMR5GOZ0NF,"other than annas head turning so easy, the dolls are very nice."
RMHU2GUJQNG95,very cheap puzzles.
RMHU2GUJQNG95,pieces do not lie flat and stay together which makes putting these together very frustrating.
RMHU2GUJQNG95,my daughter has a puzzle from the dollar tree that is better than these.
RWMEHVUOMHZ2D,the kids lovewell made and safe
R1I7LB4C2213W1,great add to collection
R744BDHH17ZUP,purchased for granddaughters 5th birthday.
R744BDHH17ZUP,she loves this set as much as her other playmobil sets.
R744BDHH17ZUP,"it comes in a nice case so everything stays in its place and so far, she hasnt lost any pieces from any of the sets weve gotten her."
R744BDHH17ZUP,a true bargain in kids toys!
R2QHGCOM93SRNW,my nieces and nephews love this pool.
R2QHGCOM93SRNW,"they are ages 3, 6, and 2... money well spent."
RKZ8S26UC76QO,these were a disappointment.
RKZ8S26UC76QO,flat from the beginning
R3PYKC9CAOQA6,my son loves it.
R3PYKC9CAOQA6,auto off feature is very convenient.
R37W5X9GCVDHIF,served it purpose.
R37W5X9GCVDHIF,photoed way better than expected.

R4LW1PMHJIKNZ,cute toy!
R16AXVFTDQ6M25,good.
R20R4UI6592YM0,what a dud!
R20R4UI6592YM0,"my son purchased this, ran it once for 15 minutes and it worked great."
R20R4UI6592YM0,it has not worked since!
R20R4UI6592YM0,i contacted the seller because of the defective toy and they offered to send me a new one after i sent the defective one back.
R20R4UI6592YM0,"i went to ship it back, found out it would be $20 to ship back."
R20R4UI6592YM0,"great, now my kid would be $60 into the boat hoping that the new one works better!"
R20R4UI6592YM0,why do i not get to ship it back on their dollar because its defective?
R20R4UI6592YM0,"after contacting the seller, he now says that i can return, but there is a 25 stocking fee."
R20R4UI6592YM0,the toy is defective!
R20R4UI6592YM0,i would not buy the product or deal with this seller.
R37E4MUQBVYBZF,this is a wonderful organizer for all of my daughters shopkins.
R37E4MUQBVYBZF,shopkins are very small and come with a bunch of pieces.
R37E4MUQBVYBZF,this helps her keep them organized and the fact that it can be hung or rolled is a great feature.
R37E4MUQBVYBZF,"this is well made and the zipper pouches ensures that when put way, the shopkins will actually stay in their own pockets."
R37E4MUQBVYBZF,"i have bought her boxes with separate slots, i have bought her a train case and several other different types of organizers but this is the only one that i would recommend."
R37E4MUQBVYBZF,"in fact, im going to buy her at least one more, if not two more."
R37E4MUQBVYBZF,"if you have a child that is a collector of all things shopkins, then this is a must have for them.i received this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
R3SWMORZB8PS2Z,the cards i received were not the ones shown on the picture.
R3SWMORZB8PS2Z,i wanted the silver age spiderman as shown on the picture.
R3SWMORZB8PS2Z,what i received was ultimate spiderman which is completely different.
R3SWMORZB8PS2Z,i returned what was sent and i received the cards as pictured.
R3SWMORZB8PS2Z,i love them!
RC8VLK9UBM6J1,very educational.
RC8VLK9UBM6J1,hard to see the screen.
R1DKJT3CMZGM7C,didnt make the tail sprinkle but already a lot of fun for a two year old
R1BT4JHU4OVQGG,overall a great choice if you dont want a blow up pool and cant fit a large hard plastic one its small enough for our deck but large enough for my son and the nanny to be in together.
R1BT4JHU4OVQGG,four stars instead of 5 because we needed to anchor it to fill it.
R1BT4JHU4OVQGG,"theres no ""snapping"" to hold it up."
RLRU24Y1AEWNW,this is fun but i like the smaller one better
R3Q6SLZ04GSHOA,"one of my daughters favorite characters and now, one of her favorite toys."
R3Q6SLZ04GSHOA,looks just like his cartoon counterpart!
RBSA6T9CHGV31,my nephew loved it!
RBSA6T9CHGV31,"i do wish i could find s regular steve, though."
R1VDFCV4D9KV6Z,"this is fun and might be education, but will not last long."
R1VDFCV4D9KV6Z,"the boxes are made from thin cartons, where even a regular milk carton you find at the grocery store will be more sturdy."
R1VDFCV4D9KV6Z,"the food items are from flimsy plastic, and i would have preferred something like asinb00b2aylys this fruit and vegetable kit, which uses better materials, and even had much more detailed models."
R1VDFCV4D9KV6Z,"compared to the items in that package these seem to be an afterthought.overall, it is fun."
R1VDFCV4D9KV6Z,i would not deny that.
R1VDFCV4D9KV6Z,however the fun will not last long we have already damaged several of the items.
RABZNLME5P1QW,price was okay.
RABZNLME5P1QW,we used to plant some potatoes and leafy greens.
RABZNLME5P1QW,"very durable originally, but with weathering ripped pretty easily with potatoes."
RABZNLME5P1QW,"i would purchase again, but not for gardening."
RABZNLME5P1QW,"did have a strong smell when arrived, but if using for sack races or decor, airing out for a day or two should help."
RI2Z33WZFHOYS,dont waste your money.
R2P37MFGFFA446,thank you
R1M0R80UNUEABF,"we saw someone use this book and my 10 year old was intrigued so was i, so i ordered one for her."
R1M0R80UNUEABF,she loves it!
R1M0R80UNUEABF,"she performs the trick by hitting the book on her head in between stages its cute and a good distraction, which every good magician must have."
R1M0R80UNUEABF,she loves to show guests and her friends when they visit our house.
R1M0R80UNUEABF,they dont pick up on how its done!
R1M0R80UNUEABF,"this is my daughters very first magic ""trick"" of any kind, and i would highly recommend this book!"
R1M0R80UNUEABF,i believe it would make a very good gift for a wide span of ages my 12 year old daughter even had fun with it!
R2DT87979W03LT,"they just dont look how i expected them to, they are flat and flimsy but they will be fine for our birthday party."
R5F10Z3AUOY4D,it fit everything!
R5F10Z3AUOY4D,i love it!
R5F10Z3AUOY4D,the only thing i dont like is that is doesnt actually buckle shut.
R5F10Z3AUOY4D,it just has small magnets that dont really work.
R3LN0IK8FQH22F,face faded fast not to good.
R2EHMTJN68EBXP,these are very sturdy and the decal works great.
R1ULAGDWCGK56O,challenging and interesting puzzle
R1XWOEE7AQTL54,its a good card for a noncombat damage deck
R3UDH2MVQC8A86,purchased this for my 3 year old sons birthday and it was a hit.
R3UDH2MVQC8A86,great product.
R1SKXOUU4GRH99,the stamps were all dried out.
R2FIB344QTA9AA,everything went smooth
R3108PRLC3O7SY,great game!!
R3108PRLC3O7SY,call it advanced phase 10. shipped and arrived very quickly.
R3108PRLC3O7SY,"my wife has long loved this game and bought it for date night, this game can actually be played by 2 players and still be fun."
R3108PRLC3O7SY,does not require 4 or more.
R3108PRLC3O7SY,the box is very cheap but the tiles and standes are good quality.
R3108PRLC3O7SY,numbers are painted not engraved.
R2ERR0LO3O2CY,it didnt have enough lights!!
R2ERR0LO3O2CY,and was too small.
R38EAM9LL14OA0,"nice quality table, our son loves it and uses it everyday!"
R38EAM9LL14OA0,its holding up very well taking all the abuse a 6yr can dish out.
R3KXPLTH421684,"my 3 year old son was afraid of it at first, especially when it moved but when he saw his older sibling playing with it he was fine."
R3KXPLTH421684,they liked shooting the balls and even made their own target.
R3KXPLTH421684,"it is a rather large toy, so storage is a problem."
R3KXPLTH421684,we decided to just make it a part of the kids bedroom decor.
R2AROMOFF66BIP,we love pooh bear
R33WNI8ZEVN6AR,love this game for all ages.
R33WNI8ZEVN6AR,easy to learn and play.

R154IGLG3S8ZZZ,"my friends and i became addicted to playing this game after our first, practice round."
R154IGLG3S8ZZZ,one never knows how fates going to intervene and make the loser become the winner.
R154IGLG3S8ZZZ,lots of fun  especially with those wild cards changing with each hand.
R22QXB0HOSH923,"i initially tried to hide this from my granddaughter, but the power was on and whenever youd move the box, the sound would o off."
R22QXB0HOSH923,"she immediately opened it and went to work trying to figure this game out.there are two levels of volume and an off buttonthere are 3 gamesthere are 5 levelschildren can build 100 wordsletter namesletter soundsword buildinggreat for preschool and kindergarten aged childrenthe viewer screen is approximately, 2 x 3 inches and is orange, with pixilated text and pictures."
R22QXB0HOSH923,its a pretty simple tool made up of durable plastic.
R22QXB0HOSH923,i dont think users will have to worry about anything if they drop this educational toy.
R22QXB0HOSH923,this a leapfrog toy and we love them.
R1YR86FML0CA7W,ordered cookie and got abbey.
R4QX68OU333TH,my toddler really loved these.
R4QX68OU333TH,i used them for her cake topper but she played with them for hours.
R29BFGTAWC9073,the kids really loved playing with these kept them busy they were so happy when we received them .asinb010gnp1cw 40 rocket balloons with red hand held air inflator  double action balloon air pump .
R29BFGTAWC9073,i have never seen anything like this in the department stores .
R29BFGTAWC9073,they are really durable .i received these rocket balloons and pump at a discounted price an exchange for truthful and unbiased review .
R2TL5ALN8JYL9V,"bought it locally, reviewing it here."
R2TL5ALN8JYL9V,i got it to add more to my heroscape armies.great detail and painting on this guy.
R2TL5ALN8JYL9V,"you just get the golem, no skeletal minions."
R2TL5ALN8JYL9V,"the golem is large and distinctive, enough so to resemble a boss character or a unique hero."
R2TL5ALN8JYL9V,"its durable, weighs quite a bit for a minifigure, and fits perfectly fine onto heroscape terrain."
R2TL5ALN8JYL9V,not sure what else to say.
R2TL5ALN8JYL9V,"if it looks cool to you, grab it."
R3OAQC15DOY46N,in my emt classroom.
R3OAQC15DOY46N,we all live to play.
R2FHF0TVYOT7IH,my grandson loves it.
R2FHF0TVYOT7IH,the only negative is battery operated trains do not stay on the tracks or handle inclines.
R165W9E5BH0DUN,good worth it
R1GJG8UH2WM9CB,wrong batteries... wont fit....
RY1PILPYK005X,this is the expansion you want if you commonly play with 23 players.
RY1PILPYK005X,it smooths out strategies that might rely on tiles that never come out.
RY1PILPYK005X,with this expansion you have another path to victory!
RY1PILPYK005X,"i bought this through uniqueplaceusa, the game came in an envelope and naturally was dinged up a bit."
R1HDG48FGDS9DI,my granddaughter age 5 loves this toy.
R1HDG48FGDS9DI,she immediately began assembling the...cars?
R1HDG48FGDS9DI,vehicles?
R1HDG48FGDS9DI,creations?
R1HDG48FGDS9DI,they were fun with plenty of parts.
R1HDG48FGDS9DI,most of the parts are large enough and not a choking hazard but some are small.
R1HDG48FGDS9DI,only recommend this for older than toddler age.i particularly like that it comes in its own sturdy plastic box  carrier with a lid.
R1HDG48FGDS9DI,so many times these toys with many parts can get scattered all over the place.
R1HDG48FGDS9DI,"this helps keep all the parts together, it fits nicely on a shelf, and its clear so you can see whats in it."
R2F7IA91MOVO9C,a great game!
R1TTU93676L2ZN,thanks
R3FKJSPK66P3B0,not worth the money.
R3FKJSPK66P3B0,product description says it is hand painted.
R3FKJSPK66P3B0,the blocks are painted white with colored stickers on them for labeling.
R3FKJSPK66P3B0,i could have made this same set for less than $10.
R3FKJSPK66P3B0,white paint is a matt finish which means any little thing will stain it.
R3FKJSPK66P3B0,will be returning.

R29EB2QZN9KP3O,i bought this for my 1 yr old granddaughter and she loves it.

R29EB2QZN9KP3O,looks like i will be buying another one!
R29EB2QZN9KP3O,arrived fast and it is perfect.
R2D23BLDQKAP2T,not rolls of stickers.
R2D23BLDQKAP2T,"each ""roll"" is a small strip with the ends taped together."
R2D23BLDQKAP2T,misleading picture and description.
R2WPYTZVNF67VN,very disappointing.
R2WPYTZVNF67VN,"these are about an inch tall, like toys from a crackerjack box."
R2WPYTZVNF67VN,not worth even the small price.
RROE90IRRMPZM,"received the magnifieropened the battery compartment, then realized it did not come with batteries."
RROE90IRRMPZM,put in batteries in the correct position.
RROE90IRRMPZM,"it immediately heated up, smoked, and if i had not let go, it would have burned my hand."
RROE90IRRMPZM,"an inferior piece of junk, sorry i even ordered it."
R184BN2SIBPDFJ,one broke

R2UT1CDG5I4K4W,this sphere glows quite well at night and performs as advertised.
R2UT1CDG5I4K4W,i use the sphere for my outdoor soap bubble performances.
R2UT1CDG5I4K4W,it releases many bubbles and is a nice addition to our bubble wands and handcrafted inventions.
R3DR7X4TF3ISUZ,my son loves this!
R3DR7X4TF3ISUZ,thanks for the prompt delivery.
R38WCXLZGCUXFR,"product did not seem ""new and unopened""."
R38WCXLZGCUXFR,package had been taped back together.
R38WCXLZGCUXFR,product quality poor and toy parts wouldnt screw together properly.
R38WCXLZGCUXFR,unable to use at all.
R38WCXLZGCUXFR,complete waste of money.
R38WCXLZGCUXFR,will never order from this seller again!
R33YDBCJ9ECUCX,great item for the office.
R33YDBCJ9ECUCX,"the magnets work very well, and the material is heavy and seems strong."
R33YDBCJ9ECUCX,"for the price, it makes a wonderful office tool to help waste time!"
R33YDBCJ9ECUCX,it is even reversible and has a standard dartboard on the back.

RR5282H7JNQRK,i didnt pay attention to the size and found they are too small sized.. not worth.
R2E6JEOF904GUE,"very cute, but doesnt seem to hold air for long."
R2E6JEOF904GUE,i have to refill it partially every few days since day one.
R2E6JEOF904GUE,it must have a slow leak although i dont know where...
R2YQC80LEO9DCP,much smaller than the generic snackeez i got for my daughter.
R2YQC80LEO9DCP,didnt realize it was a snackeez jr. cant really fit much of a snack
R2BWNLS7S0OFCA,well made
R1UUGLSNWUAQQO,this is a fun started drone.
R1UUGLSNWUAQQO,"its tiny, and good for buzzing around the backyard to get the hang of flying."
R1UUGLSNWUAQQO,"the battery only lasts about 5 minutes, so id recommend buying a set of backups."
R1UUGLSNWUAQQO,"if you plan on flying in doors, id also recommend buying the extra props."
R1UUGLSNWUAQQO,they bend easily.
R2ORE0CN2FYKYS,the dolls are very cute but when you press the button on the back they make a sound like singing.
R2ORE0CN2FYKYS,but it is completely notunderstandable as any language.
R2ORE0CN2FYKYS,but my grandchildren had great fun with them anyway.
R3FT7I7C1063UG,bought for my son and he loved it

R1636X25YVPLHQ,ok
R1EJNEDQVKZJL7,i couldnt find beads this big anywhere.
R1EJNEDQVKZJL7,so i got them through amazon.
R1EJNEDQVKZJL7,the string is thinner than s shoelace but still thick.
R1EJNEDQVKZJL7,the beads catch on the string sometimes though and not all the beads have the same sized holes.
R1EJNEDQVKZJL7,"but for the price its great, several colors, several shapes, builds fine motor skills, and my 2.5 year old son loves them.right now he is insisting he needs to &34lace the beads&34 and that its more important than breakfast  its a calm concentration game to him!"
R164JSGUW0J61A,first i received was obviously used and look very old.
R164JSGUW0J61A,because of trying to take me over and the hassle of returning the order...etc.
R164JSGUW0J61A,"i knocked off a star, or i wouldve gave it 4 stars."
R164JSGUW0J61A,"they did replace, and it is okay."
R164JSGUW0J61A,"not a 5 star item, just okay."
R164JSGUW0J61A,"only plays one song, over and over and over...&34hot diggity dog...&34. granddaughter loves minnie mouse, so its good, but i think with one song, she will tire of it."
R164JSGUW0J61A,her mother hates the song and so i imagine the batteries got pulled shortly after it arrived at their house.
R325TVCT4WC4U,the wooden base is nice and smooth.
R325TVCT4WC4U,the pins size is comfortable for adult hands size to handle them while playing the game.
R325TVCT4WC4U,overall the quality of this product is good and the game itself is intriguing  how to get 1 pin left only

R28EBWU3KZ2KIU,when we blew it up it was top heavy on one side.
R28EBWU3KZ2KIU,therefore it would not throw or bounce right.
R28EBWU3KZ2KIU,its like the thickness of the rubber is off.
R28EBWU3KZ2KIU,my kids never played with it.
R28EBWU3KZ2KIU,total waste of money!!!!!!!
R28EBWU3KZ2KIU,!

R27XMOS60N5E7W,the toy arrived quickly  2 days  it arrived well packaged and protected.
R27XMOS60N5E7W,"my grandson loves this toy and it is cute, just a little smaller than i thought it would be, but that is okay, my grandson is happy with it."
R27XMOS60N5E7W,"the only thing i found wrong was the light no longer lights after 2 days and it seemed to stop working after it rolled into the couch, but other than that it still works just fine and he does not seem to mind the light not working but it might be a dealbreaker for another child."
R27XMOS60N5E7W,it is a nice little inexpensive toy and i will buy another for my nephew.
R12UCB95RJJM63,bought for my granddaughter.
R12UCB95RJJM63,very cute
R2XW2VKKKX5RRP,look real.

R1MLRY6YGAXU8Z,i meant to order dustless chalk.
R2B7QV21BS7EHB,grandson loves the expansion which allow him to go under the table and around chairs
R1NRN6KS5FZXCF,"the quality of the pill is rather nice, but the big problem is the string that goes through the nipple is off center, so it does not perform as intended.to say the least, my son is a very disappointed teenager!"
R1NRN6KS5FZXCF,the thing is he doesnt want to give it up to send back for a replacement.
R1NRN6KS5FZXCF,"they should send replacement, then, i could return the defective one!"
R1NRN6KS5FZXCF,i dont want to $ and have the same thing.
R21TLN7AP5H3NG,"my husband had a lucadore mask he wanted to display in his office and the masculine forms were all too bulky, so im glad i ordered this."
R21TLN7AP5H3NG,"the price was right, and it was perfect for our display project."
R21TLN7AP5H3NG,"just know this is on the smaller sideexactly what we needed, but maybe not for everyone."
R1WG4MU5GE40XF,i bought these for children ages 3  7. they have really enjoyed using this kit.

RYMDQ15XUXQ6V,highly recommended
RAB8FWKVH9F8P,in the tool box
R3M1EUBQSFJ3E7,ive had two of these adapters for about 2 years now.
R3M1EUBQSFJ3E7,"while i did get one doa the first time, amazon took care of it."
R3M1EUBQSFJ3E7,"these are incredibly easy to set up, windows 7 and 8 found and installed drivers for them immediately and after mapping controls in project64 my friends and i were on our way!"
R3M1EUBQSFJ3E7,the only issue is the controllers arent numbered on my windows 8 computer and in 7 the numbers are swapped left port is 2 or 4 and right is 1 or 3 so setting them up can take a little bit longer.
R3M1EUBQSFJ3E7,but thats not enough of a reason to take a star off.
R2PS66YT1VP6NH,love the eurographics puzzles.
R2PS66YT1VP6NH,this one was challenge

R3RPPMVEPMO361,"circle of the hat is bend in 4 spots, in the picture its barely noticeable."
R3PC0E122FW46H,this game is easy to learn and fun to play with people of all ages.
R1C2WI2X6V58DN,i love the camera and the helicopter works well!
RGGREAF1K0SWD,"good build quality, but they are smaller than i expected."
RGGREAF1K0SWD,"id say perfect size for young kids 4  7, a bit awkward for grownups though."

R24S7I8YOFEBT1,my grandson is thrilled with this hat
R2P7K9FSMDRGB5,"this is my first schleich dragon figure, and its a beauty!"
R2P7K9FSMDRGB5,"the design and detail put into this rivals that of much more expensive items in polystyrene and porcelain, and the hinged jaw is a nice touch."
R2P7K9FSMDRGB5,some clever dental work involved there!
R2P7K9FSMDRGB5,"hope to add further figures to the dragon shelf, now that ive had the chance to evaluate the quality."
R361QSGGGEARIO,good stuff
R20RU7XCCX3OSF,"these are tiny little carts, not worth the price."

R2U0XNUWEER9XE,also this is not from the pokecenter.
R2U0XNUWEER9XE,still super cute and made my kid happy.
RTYZAYJ0500MI,only 1 tile had a flaw.
RTYZAYJ0500MI,lucky it is a flower.
RTYZAYJ0500MI,overall great.
R3M32O07SJWY04,very hot and one of the poles broke making it useless.
R3M32O07SJWY04,"i looked online to try to replace the poles, but they were out of stock and even then, the price of the replacement pole is pretty much the price of the tent."
R3M32O07SJWY04,"we just bought another tent, this time a bigger one that all of us can fit into comfortably with bigger windows to let air through, and about the same price."
R3M32O07SJWY04,do not recommend.
R1II5Z1QV4C073,this lived to be blown up another day after i had 20 boys attacking and wrestling it.
R1II5Z1QV4C073,"i was shocked, i fully expected it to be destroyed within the hour."

R157I1423LT1YO,"its very comfortable, a little tight on the cheeks at first but you get used to it the more you use it."
R157I1423LT1YO,it was my first time wearing a full face helmet so i had some trouble but its easy to adjust to it when you got the right size.
R157I1423LT1YO,ive had no problems at all with it.
R157I1423LT1YO,"in fact, after having a crash that resulted in me landing on my head, i can officially say this is comfortable and excellent protection."
R157I1423LT1YO,highly recommend it.
R1388GPXCWKPT6,this was a gift and the child enjoys it
R21N38S8UF366B,great

R2X2GDPW10Z4HB,just ordered 2 more so we can have a bigger space
RQFZ3TVSCGJB8,"seems like a very fast and durable truggy.it has plenty of space in the fuel tank, so you normally get about 20 mins of run time out of each tank."
R3QCBFOTBUP0DU,good
R2VUMJNJQTBMQK,its snoopy and woodstock.

RU5JT7LNILQS1,just as cute as the pink butterfly ball for girls!
RU5JT7LNILQS1,perfect size for toddlers to at least age 6. i dont think this ball is meant to be used by pets.
RU5JT7LNILQS1,it was perfect for my kids birthday party gifts!
RU5JT7LNILQS1,the boys loved it!
R25YXBBER6RX8Y,my grandson loves it.
R25YXBBER6RX8Y,so does everyone that sees it.
R25YXBBER6RX8Y,unfortuneately we misplaced the battery charger and it seems to have a funny connection so we are in need of a new charger.
R25YXBBER6RX8Y,anyone have access to the battery charger that comes with this car?
R25YXBBER6RX8Y,or a spare battery?
R1N0KIVF08WN0Z,spot on description with fast shipping.
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,the inside out control console with joy figurine is pretty basic.
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,the console lights up.
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,thats it.
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,it doesnt come with any memory balls.
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,and even the joy figurine is pretty basic.
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,"while this is on the cheaper end, they should have included a memory ball or some other lights or noises with the console itself."
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,its quite boring after a while.
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,other figures have to be purchased separately.
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,even the other sets only come with joy.
R1KKMDVAT4CA3C,this was a bummer.
R2V43RYOBFNTWC,"i returned, was not what i expected"
RB3LH24YV9FE6,our daughter and her friends love these!
R1J40FHRTP1D7Z,"first off, my daughters age 5 who are older than the recommended age of 2, enjoy playing with this set."
R1J40FHRTP1D7Z,they have fun taking the toolbox apart and reassembling it.
R1J40FHRTP1D7Z,"they like using the different tools.however, this is probably the least interactive leapfrog toy that i have owned."
R1J40FHRTP1D7Z,"this is not a bad thing necessarily, but if you are expecting a certain level of teaching with this toy, be aware that the education is through self discovery and not really being led through a sequence of learning."
R1J40FHRTP1D7Z,this is totally fine.
R1J40FHRTP1D7Z,"this is a toy for a toddler, and as such, it is totally delightful!disclosure i was given this toy to facilitate my review."
R1J40FHRTP1D7Z,all opinions are my own.
R1TNLTJ513EIPS,awesome!
R1TNLTJ513EIPS,i love my toy komasan.
R1TNLTJ513EIPS,very cute and i would highly recommend if you love yokai watch and komasan!
R1TNLTJ513EIPS,now all i need is a komajirou this big d
R2Q2UF6F6UOMUB,worked well
R151Y26AG9RXR0,"they are great,lots of fun"
R384MAKHSR88PW,pretty bogus.
R384MAKHSR88PW,does not even have a split cards function.
R2Y9ZVQLNMXLPA,exactly as advertised.
R2Y9ZVQLNMXLPA,"my son really like it, and was a nice addition to his huge and ever growing collection."
RFMK3Q318HUDZ,was a wast of money really... i bought these legos as a gift for my sisters 7 year old and all i got were small prices no bigger than a 2x4 block.
RFMK3Q318HUDZ,they also came with some small peices of trash and i also found some chewed up legos.
R4D8YO4CXBKKS,nice
R39QWBC06AGW3P,good stuff
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,jumping monkeys is quite fun!
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,you pick your monkey color & launch them at the tree.
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,you can even knock your opponents monkeys off with your monkeys.
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,"whoever has all 4 of their monkeys hanging properly first wins!when my son was 3 12  4 yrs old, he played almost everyday."
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,now that he is still 5 we only play occasionally.
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,though we did changes the rules a bit.
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,we dont use the bananas.
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,we would just declare a winner at the end of the round.
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,many times we would play 5  rounds.
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,it was just easier to play that way with my son.
R2DJD1XOCUVST7,everything but the bananas and box are great quality.
RYI4IU3WRCIOX,these are more for decoration and not for function.
RYI4IU3WRCIOX,looking through the lenses is like opening your eyes underwater.
R32ZN9DVIP81AG,son loves all the different vehicles
R3PI7JIFG7IIQB,"futs me perfectly and will do great for my wedding, i wear a size 8 in slippers and this works giving my foot a little room to breath a bit."
R3IXCSV4IZW08,one of the favorites
RK1HUAC762KBA,"all of the other toys that came with it were fine if a bit small, but the microwave itself would not work."
RK1HUAC762KBA,"in order for it to work, the door has to be completely closed to push in a little black button that allows it to start."
RK1HUAC762KBA,"the timer and all of the buttons are pretend, and the only working thing in it is the spinning tray and lights that only function when that little button is depressed inward."
RK1HUAC762KBA,"when it came out of the box, the door latch was bent so it could not be closed at all, and trying to bend it the correct way ended up nearly cracking the door."
RK1HUAC762KBA,i decided to just cut the latch off figuring that it doesnt need to latch so long as the door closes enough for it to push in the black button.
RK1HUAC762KBA,even without the latch that door still would not close enough to work.
RK1HUAC762KBA,"i even let the kids push on the door as hard as they could to get it to work, and it still would not unless you jammed you finger in it to press the black button."
RK1HUAC762KBA,"i was fully prepared to just take it as it was since the kids still loved it until i found a microwave at walmart that was half of the price, worked properly, all of the buttons were usable, and it came with a working timer."
RK1HUAC762KBA,needless to say im not happy with this product at all.
R1T4CXU32ZGK4A,love these marbles
R2SWEHHXPMIZ9K,my daughter loves this toy!
R2SWEHHXPMIZ9K,the product was described well  i am very satisfied of this item.
R3UNP229RMMHJ1,havent had to use these spares yet so its a little hard to rate just yet.
R1TYN28IN6R2KI,nice little expanse to an already awesome game!
R2LSCIIFZ51GKC,battery died right away and will not hold a charge.
R142WWMP1Y11VM,best miniatures ever!

R2VYMC5YKARU6W,my one year old loves it.
R1OMWWJ4ZB75M7,he is so soft and the phrases are perfect.
R1OMWWJ4ZB75M7,i love cuddling up with my little baymax and going to sleep.
R1F8WSJ4Z9EKQ6,my first drone and its easy to fly as long as there is no wind.
R1F8WSJ4Z9EKQ6,my 9 year old son has it down pat.
R1F8WSJ4Z9EKQ6,"i need to get a heavier, better suited for wind drone."
R1F8WSJ4Z9EKQ6,any suggestions?
RLPY920EUNR8M,crayola is still good quality stuff.
R1CGKLSCGODEOF,"my son is all about planes fire and rescue, so you know we had to get cabbie."
R1CGKLSCGODEOF,"he can get all 5 of his smoke jumpers inside, you just have to do it in the right order  pinecone, drip, blackout turned so his saw goes alongside drip, avalanche and dynamite as you close the door."
R2IABNGR1NL55N,"one of them had a hole, and i wasnt able to use all three."
R2IABNGR1NL55N,"two out of the three were fine, and a very cute addition to the baby shower i threw."
R12LNAXM6O3M47,"nice to add more cards, and units to an already awesome game!"
R23HJUTEHZHVX0,only received one but ordered three
RD4X1DQTLI6FO,exactly what i expected.
R1TBIAEVH4ILM0,all the kids loved them
R190WN4SSAM93Q,my 9 year old barely had it on her wrist for 5 minutes before she noticed a rip on the side which grew when she took it off.
R190WN4SSAM93Q,"i watched her put it on and take it off, she was not abusive to this material."
R190WN4SSAM93Q,not even good quality if it rips this easily.
R1G7DGE8N8PV6,great
R3FOQUGY1USDZN,very cute little police car.
R3FOQUGY1USDZN,grandson is going to love it for his birthday!
R3FOQUGY1USDZN,it arrived fast and people at the company are very nice and concerned about you being completely satisfied.
R3FOQUGY1USDZN,thank you
R1J22106706A6R,not bad for a little tiny servo.
R7P6JEUIEVCA3,it charges your p3 batteries just like the one that came with the p3 professional.
R7P6JEUIEVCA3,i bought a second so i can charge two batteries at a time.
R7P6JEUIEVCA3,"it charges them quick, cant really ask for much more."
RDS7JKCMUDG6B,we used it on our trip and my son loved it.
RDS7JKCMUDG6B,kept him occupied during our flight.
R2BZQN7A078V36,these are what i would call a disposable pool.
R2BZQN7A078V36,"i have always, since my son was a youngster, purchased pools similar to this one to be used for one summer, then disposed of when summer was over."
R2BZQN7A078V36,"its a great size pool and an adult or two can even fit in there, ive even taken an adult size floaty into an 8 pool and kids still had room to play around me, lol if you get a cover and cover it when not in use, it will help retain the heat from the sun, and keep the debris out too."
R2BZQN7A078V36,"get a cheap screened pole cleaner to scoop out any leaves, etc."
R2BZQN7A078V36,"and i just poured a little bleach in it when it got a little green or cloudy and that usually cleaned it up, or just bend the side over, let the water out and fill it again if need be."
R2BZQN7A078V36,it doesnt hold that much water actually.
R2BZQN7A078V36,usually you can get by with about a months use before you have to replace the water entirely.
R2BZQN7A078V36,"like i said it a great disposable pool for the summer months and doesnt require a lot of money andor maintenance, but provides a lot of refreshing fun!"
R309G6KOWSUT0Y,"great puzzles... not too easy, but not exceptionally difficult."
R309G6KOWSUT0Y,a lot of fun!
R2PY23BO6UHVET,very high quality product that met all expectations.
R2PY23BO6UHVET,"description on site is accurate, and the package came between the expected dates."
R2PY23BO6UHVET,the figure itself is exceptionally well molded and painted and comes with a very nice base and extra sword.
R2PY23BO6UHVET,"a warning to anyone considering purchasing the shipping does take a fairly long time, but this fact was outlined for me before i purchased the product."
R34L4KP5HOEHEM,my daughter is obsessed with owls.
R34L4KP5HOEHEM,this owl is darling and incredibly soft.
R34L4KP5HOEHEM,"it clearly states 7"", but i was still surprised as it was smaller than i expected, but that was my issue."
R34L4KP5HOEHEM,this is a great quality plush.
RKTTA6V2RB3RQ,"not all shoes fit barbie and they arent the same as whats in the photo however, its a lot of variety for very little money"
R3HY6DEGD20666,purchased for a carnival birthday party.
R3HY6DEGD20666,may have to attached to a board if i want it more durable.
R2N4FBBG0S6GBT,i was offered this 46 inch rainbow kite for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it.
R2N4FBBG0S6GBT,we have a good about of property so there is enough room to fly the kite.
R2N4FBBG0S6GBT,it took off super easy and flew for ever up there.
R2N4FBBG0S6GBT,we put a different spool with longer and thicker string to fly higher and it was accepting of the different size.
R2N4FBBG0S6GBT,i absolutely love this kite and the kids enjoyed it as well.
R2N4FBBG0S6GBT,maybe the first kite they have ever flown.
R2N4FBBG0S6GBT,"if you are looking for a great kite, i definitely recommend this 46 inch rainbow kite."
R2D0BNO8PKKIHL,some letters of the alphabet were not included and first words like dad that babies might learn to say could not be spelled out.
R2T4HUIPMJGSG9,"""green toys"" brand of toys are great."
R2T4HUIPMJGSG9,"bought this one for my youngest grandson,  now 3. he loves playing with it."
R2T4HUIPMJGSG9,a great toy for the bathtub during bath time.
R2T4HUIPMJGSG9,"his parents and myself are completely satisfied as well, because of the great quality, etc."
R1IFXC96XTWZXO,i use this game with my high school special education students and was pleasantly surprised by their reactions.
R1IFXC96XTWZXO,i never know what they will think of new gamesactivities i introduce to them and whether or not they will be appropriate for their levels.
R1IFXC96XTWZXO,"because of the two sides with easier vs. harder words, i was able to modify it for whoever was playing."
R1IFXC96XTWZXO,i did away with the board game and instead call out all of the clues and they shout out the answer.
R1IFXC96XTWZXO,"whoever gets the right word gets to keep the card and by the end of the period, whoever has the most cards is the winner."
R1IFXC96XTWZXO,i think the board and dice are unnecessary and wouldnt work for my students but maybe they are better for smaller groups.
R1IFXC96XTWZXO,great addition to my classroom and fun friday activities that are educational and fun.
RZUN0K0071C9Z,looks good

R2G7QBQXQCU5NL,how do you rate this game anything but a five!
R2G7QBQXQCU5NL,"the game does break down much more efficiently than i remember for storage, but it still gives 100 of the fun that i remember to my children."
RIGWEUPI1ZYII,buyer beware.
RIGWEUPI1ZYII,i thought i was ordering a hard plastic doll case that was 24 inches high ...future buyers know what you are ordering...do conversion.
RIGWEUPI1ZYII,i could have bought this piece of crap at any hobby shop and saved myself the time and trouble of ordering.
RIGWEUPI1ZYII,mybad.collection transparent plastic case figure doll case case w 12 x d 12 x h 24 cm japan import

R28DPDG7QXPPEV,"very nice, arrived on time."
R2XBMTLXY384KO,i have a newborn and my two older girls love to be little mommies.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,my girls love to carry their dolls with them.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,this is a very cute toy that allows them to carry their doll.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,they can wear their doll in the front or the back.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,"we have had several of these, but this is a very nice one."
R2XBMTLXY384KO,it is thicker than the others.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,"it is very well made, and feels nice and thick."
R2XBMTLXY384KO,it is very cute with the pink flowers and hearts.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,"it is also adjustable, which is nice."
R2XBMTLXY384KO,"it can be worn by a slightly older child, too."
R2XBMTLXY384KO,it is soft.there was only one drawback that i saw and which was the reason i took off the star.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,i felt that the place where you put the doll was a little shallow.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,some of the bigger dolls bent down or wouldnt stay because of that.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,i wish it had a little bit of a deeper opening in which to put the doll.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,it did get my daughter a little frustrated.
R2XBMTLXY384KO,"overall, it is a very nice toy, however, and i would recommend it."
RRV7E4Z7I1JQ6,good condition!
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,this rc control monster is huge!
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,a lot bigger than i thought.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,it is more than twice as big as my shoe box.this toy came with batteries and rechargeable battery pack.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,initial charging time is about 2 hours.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,battery assembly is a little tricky but not hard.the toy advertised as &34no terrain is too tough for this rc vehicle&34 but in fact it is hard to maneuver this vehicle on smooth and flat surface.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,it is best to play this on the rough surfaceterrain for best traction.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,it is hard to control this monster also because the battery packed a lot of power.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,any push on the remote control and the vehicle moved really fast and hard.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,i am a little worried about the rechargeable battery compartment.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,it is not water proof.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,so in a slightly rough water i am afraid the water can get inside and damage the battery pack.
RKE1AJRFQ3RJQ,"one other problem i noticed too is like other reviewer said, this thing does not go straight line and it doesnt not turn easily if you are playing on flat surface."
R3506RN9UGE3RU,"we ordered the soaring pegasus set, but when the package arrived and we opened it we found that other package had been previously opened and then retaped."
R3506RN9UGE3RU,"second the set wasnt the pegasus set, but the cloudsdale set."
R3506RN9UGE3RU,very disappointed!
R2XUMI0QI87EMA,plastic separated from package.
RMZ6API20SS2Q,my son loves this toy.
RMZ6API20SS2Q,he plays with it nonstop at daycare and then plays with it some more at home.
RMZ6API20SS2Q,it helps with walking as he needs to stand to play with the various items on top and he walks around it to get to the other side to play.
RMZ6API20SS2Q,it has a spanish setting which is great to help learn another language too!
RMZ6API20SS2Q,love it!
RY55QO4W4803B,delivery was fast.

RY55QO4W4803B,i recommend this to any grey tabby cat lover.
R15RFWWUW5CRO2,we buy glow necklaces every year for an event and tried this company for the first time this year because we were disappointed in the quality of a previous vendor.
R15RFWWUW5CRO2,wow!
R15RFWWUW5CRO2,"these were head and shoulders above ones we had used beforethe color is bright, they stay fastened, and they last."
R15RFWWUW5CRO2,we will definitely use this company again!
R2GK385Z0NUIF2,"the 2x2 breaks super easily, the 3x3 is backwards."
R2GK385Z0NUIF2,but other then those two things the cubes move very well and are still impressive when solved
R1L47MYG3YQVR8,most loose water after a few min
R2LQHWEACHVPP7,"i ordered these before i read the reviews, and most of the reviews were awful, but i dont think it was that bad."
R2LQHWEACHVPP7,"i tried to return it before i got them, but i am glad i didnt."
R2LQHWEACHVPP7,they turned out to be just fine.
R206UMQLWJPXAC,love it
R1YWAA6T2HB202,pretty good car.
R1YWAA6T2HB202,it can drift very well.
R1YWAA6T2HB202,only one thing 4 aaa batteries can die very quickly and it will cause the car can not run in full speed.
R1YWAA6T2HB202,and it can not drift without a high speed.
R159IP06VKN651,my son loved it!
R159IP06VKN651,he is 7. its a little longer than other sabers.

R34M6XGXKISJ2G,great trap for madalche decks that why i bought it
R2UJQD1LGHSEG7,sides broke down on this within a week of having it so it doesnt close very well now.
R2UJQD1LGHSEG7,but its ok for the price.
R2UJQD1LGHSEG7,it would be much better with more sturdy sides.
R2GWKTQ5ZJXZ5U,"yes, it did,"
RRYT1PQ6P8HNR,they are great.... thanks for asking
R1INXCA62VPSOF,i saw this game at comiccon and played it briefly at one of the tables where they were demoing it.
R1INXCA62VPSOF,ive never played any of the gloom games before and very much liked the idea of the transparent cards where you can play on top of your own or other peoples piles to change the course of the game.now ive played it 8 times with 35 people.
R1INXCA62VPSOF,"while the game is enjoyable, it has not completely lived up to my expectations."
R1INXCA62VPSOF,"it seems to be the consensus position that it takes too long to play and most of the times ive played we all wished it were over sooner.if 2 or more people gang up on someone, they can pretty much prevent them from making any forward progress in the game, or so weve found, and that person gets frustrated.so fun game, cute cards and nice artwork, but just did not quite live up to what we were expecting."
RHO62F8NN8CRO,great items for any jaws collector
R2HKBJAWBZQYSB,used some yesterday.
R2HKBJAWBZQYSB,looks nice!
RNVNTXMR47VU8,"this is a puffy sticker set, so you get more than you would from a traditional flatsticker set  those are hard to peel off and reuse!"
RNVNTXMR47VU8,"ive always had good luck with melissa and doug toys, having started with a nice wood puzzle for our youngest and gone from there."
RNVNTXMR47VU8,"like all of their toys, these are simple and help kids work with patterns, characters, colors, and so on."
R54LW9PPJVT43,great product!
R7D3SBKLV7HXO,one of the best 180sx bodies out there right now.
R7D3SBKLV7HXO,"its very accurate and very detailed, other than being a bit big shouldered reason why its a 195mm body instead of a 190mm."
R7D3SBKLV7HXO,"they could have sunk the rear bumper in more for better accuracy, especially since they formed it using something similar to tamiyas 3 piece mold method."
R7D3SBKLV7HXO,other than that its a great body and highly recommended for all 180sx fans.
R7D3SBKLV7HXO,just dont buy it from here at this ridiculous price.
R38N9B1IL4C6H9,hard to wipe off from glass
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,i received this toy as part of a promotion.
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,it was a nice surprise for my kids.
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,"the package came and i let them know it was for them  no birthdays, holidays or other special events were near."
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,"so, they were excited to tear open such a huge box."
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,"at first, they kids were a bit disappointed that the truck only comes with one pup and mini vehicle."
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,"the box showed pictures of several paw patrol agents and because the box was so big, they just figured more than one character would be included."
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,"they quickly got over that, however, and they love this thing."
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,they ran and got other toys to add to the patroller and played with it until dinner.
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,i couldnt believe they didnt start fighting over it.
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,"it took them some time to figure out all of the neat things the patroller could do and each time, they ran to me saying, ""it can do this"" or it can do that""."
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,we received this toy 2 days before leaving for vacation.
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,we were gone for 2 weeks and the first thing they played with when we got back?
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,the paw patroller.
R3HPA7KO2KZ1NT,"my 5 year old girl likes it, but its truly the 8 and 9 year old boys that have been playing with it!"
R2M7Y75INHDXHS,what a great gift for a toddler!
R2M7Y75INHDXHS,"adora is truly adorable, cuddly, and will provide a lot of fun to its little owner."
R2FZPQN49UXAB9,love it
R97F1Q6T95ZTX,we bought this for our 7yo.
R97F1Q6T95ZTX,followed the instructions on box and used water in the base.
R97F1Q6T95ZTX,before the day ended the seal around the bottom fill port failed and it sprung a leak.
R97F1Q6T95ZTX,do not put water in it.
R97F1Q6T95ZTX,we are not happy.
R97F1Q6T95ZTX,smaller issue the sb does not bounce back upright after a good whack.what did we like?
R97F1Q6T95ZTX,size is good for a 50 percentile 7 year old.
R97F1Q6T95ZTX,our son likes the design because he is really into batman.
R3Q5U9NPL9GVT8,my wife loves it.
R3Q5U9NPL9GVT8,plays three four time a week.

R36YOJTRBRXUIZ,canopy fit perfectly on existing swing set
RZ339IPPHJHPL,"so when i got this, i opened it and it seemed a bit different then usual, it was runnier, not as thick."
RZ339IPPHJHPL,"as soon as i touched the color, it didnt even stain my skin, its an obvious fake."
RZ339IPPHJHPL,"yes, its cheaper, but no."
RZ339IPPHJHPL,its not manic panic.
RZ339IPPHJHPL,"im hoping it comes out like manic panic does anyways, but i doubt it."
RZ339IPPHJHPL,it wont even stain my skin.
RZ339IPPHJHPL,"which if youve used manic panic before, you know it stains so bad if it stains your skin, its usually going to be a really good dye."
RZ339IPPHJHPL,im so upset that i wasted my money on a fake.buy from the actual site or sallys beauty supply.
RZ339IPPHJHPL,this stuff sucks.
R2TJPE78LSELVC,best value for the money of any nerf gun ive seen so far.
R2TJPE78LSELVC,"darts jam from time to time, but its usually because were trying to fire too fast."

R2TJPE78LSELVC,definitely recommend.
R3QN71ZRXGFHLR,exactly what they describe a
R157HFJ9PLJING,"i bought for my son, the wwe fan and he now has all the mens title belts, it is something he likes to collect and have around."
R157HFJ9PLJING,he does not wear them and they are toys and it closes around the waist held together by velcro but i am unable to say it it would fall off easily or not with the velcro closure.
R157HFJ9PLJING,"i would but it again if they want it, it makes them happy and it is inexpensive and arrived in 2 days."
R157HFJ9PLJING,it also looks just as pictured.
R1O0A9W14M748I,i understand you get what you pay for but 2 of the costumes were already falling apart at the seams when they arrived.
R2A7N673T278JD,"beautiful, high quality, just as a true montessorian would expect!"
R1OD5XV3WKFS8R,the product shown is not what i recieved.
R1OD5XV3WKFS8R,the bag i did receive will work for a school bag which was its intended purpose.
R1OD5XV3WKFS8R,it was cinderella themed so i was quite disappointed seeing how beauty in the beast is my all time disney favorite.
R1XEJ6N76MBAZS,its a good card for a noncombat damage deck
R35MS9MPZF7T3N,i love this toy box
R1TR1CY57UUGQT,"it arrived quickly, very happy."
R300KON8C17896,"great for hand eye coordination, got here right away."
R3TWWDO1TKWU7E,nice piece
RBARCPBVUSEJD,fall apart easily
R1X5ZB8WNGE069,the balls and bat and tee are tough and light.
R1X5ZB8WNGE069,good job.
R1X5ZB8WNGE069,but when it says the height is adjustable that just isnt entirely true.
R1X5ZB8WNGE069,its too high for our toddler.
R3U94RTFKYSKCO,"again syma comes through with a great little quad that flys great, can crash it, and will still perform again and again, only flaw is the little rubber covers come off easily on the sticks, you should either take them off, or put a little glue on them."
R3U94RTFKYSKCO,if you have a dog or a small child you need tho do this as a safeguard.
RFWBO6U0E9W6C,my granddaughter loved it!
R3AMGZRKLU0064,fun game!
R3AMGZRKLU0064,played with the family and the kids really enjoyed it.
R2FDB7QANS30IC,"beautiful, high quality, just as a true montessorian would expect!"
RM0GPVA9AXMWJ,im a huge star wars fan i own a lot of revell star wars model and like the rest of the models from revell the tie is a lil blue thats fine dont care whos to say what they really look like are they grey or a tent of blue who knows who cares....but it was easy to build and it comes with a stand...not a toy just a model...build it go pew pew then put it on the shelf
R25FBLFMWVAUDK,worked great  just like i thought they would.
R2AOG4U2IT4B17,so cute!
RX3ZVYKDDUM3N,used these for a dinosaur themed birthday party.
RX3ZVYKDDUM3N,bought a small plastic pool and buried the eggs in sand in said pool.
RX3ZVYKDDUM3N,kiddos had lots of fun digging these up and loved the extra surprise of the dinosaur toy inside.
RX3ZVYKDDUM3N,eggs and dinosaurs are durable and did not crack or break under the sand.
R2G3IJ50RACBQJ,"wonderful toy for the little boy for his birthday, was a hit!"
R2LZZYABTD17L3,color coded for toddlers.
R2LZZYABTD17L3,caps fit securely.
R2LZZYABTD17L3,a necessity for little ones who paint.
R3GXC909HQ9JP4,love it!
R1UTIA8JNZDOKA,"the picture is super cute, but mine came with eyes angling down that makes it look sad."
R1UTIA8JNZDOKA,material wise and size and everything else is good  but who wants a sad lamb?
R2RU9OPNSZNWGF,she went to work and made one for her dad.
R2RU9OPNSZNWGF,she said it took a while.
R2RU9OPNSZNWGF,i think she will love making them for her friends.
R2RU9OPNSZNWGF,she just turned 7.
RAS2JI2S1MMX7,excellent product for young children.
R2QBQJJM6JFR4V,i think this card is pretty good.
R2QBQJJM6JFR4V,its not currently amazing in this meta but i feel like at some point it will become extremely relevant.
R2QBQJJM6JFR4V,i picked up my copy now and now just waiting for the right time to whip it on someone.
R1IB98GG6YXWLH,kids enjoy these toys.
R1IB98GG6YXWLH,they are built really well.
R3NDAX5NDBLDPW,"arrive on time, looked great!"
R17OW5QB5SNN43,not very durable bought two one was broken by the kids in 2 weeks
R3DC2D5NDK6H75,this kite was worth the $13.00 approx.
R3DC2D5NDK6H75,that i paid for it but certainly not the full price stated.
R3DC2D5NDK6H75,"it is a cheap kite, light weight kite string... it flew fine for the money but i expected more based on the ""original"" price."
R21PMWFV6H2Q1W,great
R2DX3Z4Q3CIE7Y,"i debated for a long time over whether to buy the fullsize version of this adorable kitten lalaloopsy asinb00ezikvp2 lalaloopsy pet pals purrty kitten paws doll which, although quite cute, was a bit pricey so i was very pleased to finally see a mini version on the market."
R2DX3Z4Q3CIE7Y,"shes just as cute as her fullsize counterpart, much less expensive and fit in better with my collection of mini lalaloopsies."
R2DX3Z4Q3CIE7Y,"her packaging, as with the rest of the lalaloopsy minis, has been simplified so that it no longer makes a play house when you remove the plastic partition as a collector, this doesnt bother me, but if youre considering purchasing this item for a child that may be something you want to consider."
R2DX3Z4Q3CIE7Y,"overall, i think the animalthemed twist on the usually humanlike lalaloopsy dolls is really adorable, and i hope they continue to make more!"
R3ION34H2M29N3,my child loves it
R2C2DZLBWZ53G3,great little toy quadcopter for the price!
R2C2DZLBWZ53G3,fun to fly!
R2C2DZLBWZ53G3,buy extra props because you will break a few.
R2SZU8GWSS224Q,excellent
R2AD9M3L7QQN3B,"box is nice, stitching and embossing are quality, and the magnetic closure works a treat."
R2AD9M3L7QQN3B,hardsleevestoploaders fit in this thing just right.
R2AD9M3L7QQN3B,"i was able to get my whole dice masters d&d starter set, complete with hard sleeves and dice, into one of these boxes."

R2JTK3XGGHMX9G,received the product sooner than expected which was a plus.
R2JTK3XGGHMX9G,price seemed a bit high though.
RG0EV2VC4CQTS,absolutely adorable and a big hit with my granddaughter who loves all things peppa.
RG0EV2VC4CQTS,made well.
RMKXZDOZD1KC2,"it worked well, and is holding a charge longer than the original one."
R3JTA5K3QV25RO,my son loves it!
R2J1HWX0CI1B1W,cute toy to play with for kids under 6 and a cute toy to collect for older children.
R2J1HWX0CI1B1W,"they are fun and cute, but i dont think they truly interact with one another."
R2J1HWX0CI1B1W,they just make random noises at the same time.
R3DDPNG4029PK0,"we have a ton of leappad games, some mostly disneythemed get played often, others less so."
R3DDPNG4029PK0,all of them have a 15 to 30minute shelf life unless the kids are trapped in the car.this imagicard system really changes that.
R3DDPNG4029PK0,"by making the game tactile and interactive, the girls will play for over an hour easily."
R3DDPNG4029PK0,"they think theyre so cool taking pics with their leappad and the game is very forgiving and responsive, two things i was previously concerned about.theres still a learning curve, as with all leapster products, so i think 5 is the right age to try it without a lot of parental help."
R3U9BF2KDHE4U8,"it comes with a lot of thread, which makes it a decent deal."
R3U9BF2KDHE4U8,but it is exactly what you see in the pictures.
R3U9BF2KDHE4U8,"there is a hook on either side of the machine, you wrap the threads back and forth between the hooks and there is a roller on the side that helps you to create bracelets."
R3U9BF2KDHE4U8,"i was hoping this would be fun, or easier, as we used to make these as kids by hand."
R3U9BF2KDHE4U8,the hand way is just as easy.
R3U9BF2KDHE4U8,"as my niece pulled it off the machine, she accidentally dropped it and it all unraveled anyway.if you have a daughter or son that loves to make these bracelets, then it might be worth it."
R3U9BF2KDHE4U8,but it is just as easy to make them by hand.
R3U9BF2KDHE4U8,the machine for us wasnt worth the fuss.
RBZD5R1BCQSXK,fits quarters and some tokens.
RGV019WTMVYUI,these glasses all for an upcoming halloween party and the glasses will be worn by my sister to complete her costume.
R1DEPEAVOE27JF,this game is really solid.
R1DEPEAVOE27JF,i love the mixture of mechanics deckbuilding and action drafting.
R1DEPEAVOE27JF,it has the great balance of interaction that isnt too mean.
R1DEPEAVOE27JF,i ordered mine through uniqueplaceusa and the game came badly packaged.
R1DEPEAVOE27JF,i ended up with a dented box.
R1DEPEAVOE27JF,the same applies to keyflower merchants.
R3L94DL9AVEPDN,love this game!!!
R3L94DL9AVEPDN,"it brings back memories, playing it when i was a kid, with my grandma."

RRA8UMWKONRRN,great details!
R2ULS960R5MJBB,this game is extremely fun and a great party game!
R2ULS960R5MJBB,"i bought the original set and the extension pack 1.the object of the game is for the &34playerincharge&34, which rotates each round, to put down a card that often has a blank that needs to be filled in."
R2ULS960R5MJBB,"each player puts down a card that they feel best fills in the blank and answers the question, as well as what will appeal to the &34hosts&34 personality the most."
R2ULS960R5MJBB,the host doesnt see who puts down what card.
R2ULS960R5MJBB,"the host picks their favorite response, and the person who put down that card gets to collect the hosts question card."
R2ULS960R5MJBB,"the person who collects the most question cards wins.many of these questions and answers are &34dirty&34, or not pc, so it is not a good idea to play with someone who is easily offended."
R2ULS960R5MJBB,"the more players you have, the more fun the game is.this game is a study in character."
R2ULS960R5MJBB,you have to know something about each of the players personalities and what types of responses would best appeal to them if you want the best shot at winning!
R3EMTSXZDGJDF,daughter loves this doll.
R1B0B4CA8798I6,excellent product.

R2KDMC5XQKU0Y1,the sizing seems to be accurate.
R2KDMC5XQKU0Y1,"my daughter is turning eight and normally wears between an 8 and 12 in girls clothes, so i bought her a 910 and it just fits her."
R2KDMC5XQKU0Y1,she is very happy with the dress and will be a beautiful anna for her birthday party and also halloween.
R1BBI0VA9MZB0U,not to easy to fly as the seller would like you to believe.
R1BBI0VA9MZB0U,"instructions are hard to understand, like a bad chinnese translation."
R1BBI0VA9MZB0U,however it is able to take a bit of a beating fly on a large field with lots of room the price was right good buy for the money
R3URL0HDJN5VWS,nice
R18YF2WWT1USKP,son loved it
RI1UOAUV6J3QD,love this!
RI1UOAUV6J3QD,my daughter absolutley loves it.
RI1UOAUV6J3QD,the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because when i got it there was some goop or something on one section of the wheel and it made the paper picture come off.
R3D06GPAQUKQM8,"was excited when i found this glow pigment in purple  i love purple!the item was quickly shipped, packaged well a little bit goes a long way when used with resin."
R3D06GPAQUKQM8,"mix a minute amount with white acrylic paint to create a unique effect  im sure there are more uses i have yet to discover, but so far the results are promising!"
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,im giving this product a 2 star rating primarily because of the age range on the packaging.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,we received this set and another legos juniors set for my sons 5th birthday.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,the age range on the packages reads 47 years.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,there is no.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,way.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,a 4 or 5 year old could put these sets together.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,some of the parts are unbelievably small and my son could not even pick them up.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,we had to quickly gather up the little bags and get them onto the kitchen table to be opened or we would have lost half the parts if he had dumped them on the floor of our living room like he was about to do and dont most kids that age?.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,it took my husband a good hour of cursing to put them together and then we had to tell our son he can only play with them in the kitchen or our 18 month old would definitely be swallowing parts.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,"i can see these getting played with when hes older but half the fun of legos is building things yourself, not waiting for your parents to have time to build them for you."
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,it just seems to me the age range is way off for the size of the bricks.
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,"otherwise its a cute set, just not for a 5 year old to enjoy building."
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,"and now as parents we have the ""fun"" of having to rebuild the darn things every time he knocks a piece off or pulls it apart."
R3EDMOBBCHNCMX,seems like a waste to me.
R1W50MXBQFA2RF,well made toy that mu daughter loves.
R1W50MXBQFA2RF,planning to pick up a few more to complete the mcstuffins clan.
R1XLXW9K4XXT56,great buy!

RRHAEBPR99OV7,"as advertised, willing to exchange."
RRHAEBPR99OV7,good sellers.
R5K8MDC3ILQKL,this is listed at $70.
R5K8MDC3ILQKL,"i would expect proportional steering, a rechargeable battery, 50 yards of range, some kind of suspension system, and 50 yards of range for that price."
R5K8MDC3ILQKL,"this toy is overpriced by half, at least."
R5K8MDC3ILQKL,"this would be 4 stars at $35, and 5 stars at $25."
R1OG6BNE7R6L4Z,fun game to play with my 3.5 year old!
R1OG6BNE7R6L4Z,he stays more interested in this one than candy land or chutes and ladders.

R1EZ0MGN8OAOHX,this is a great helmet.
R1EZ0MGN8OAOHX,i bought it as a part of my sons halloween costume.
R1EZ0MGN8OAOHX,"its a heavier plastic, the chin strap is nice secured to it and it fits his 6 yr old head just nicely."
R1EZ0MGN8OAOHX,i can wear it on my head too but its a little snug and i wouldnt want to be wearing it around too long.
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,i feel like the first review posted here sells the game short a bit.
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,"while its like risk in that both games have dice, the ares project adds in quite a few other elements to combat."
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,"units are divided into four types infantry, armor, air, and buildings and each unit has its own tohit numbers for each of these unit types as well as special abilities tough, shielded, deep strike, and others in addition to positional modifiers, flanking modifiers, and other modifiers from special buildings or attached technologiespowers."
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,its very possible for a single wellplaced force to decimate a larger force if you properly utilize the strengths and weaknesses built into the combat system.
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,admittedly the basic rules are fairly simple and omit many of the special powers and buildings that add complexity to the game.
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,"however, the developers intended the basic rules to be a tutorial to help players get a grasp on the combat system before graduating to the full rules."
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,"once the full rules are in play, each of the four factions takes on an asymmetrical aspect as each produces units, power, and upgrades differently."
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,each faction is designed with specific strengths and weaknesses and favors a certain play style.
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,"the flavor of each faction is pretty strong a force of space marines and their vehicles, a cabal of psychic wizards flinging elemental spells and hazards, everevolving insectoid martians, and a gargantuan mecha and creates a lot of amazing scenarios with a little imagination."
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,i would not describe this game as simple.
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,the rules do have a bit of a learning curve but thats because the game has depth.
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,"if you have a dedicated player you can learn the game with, theres a lot of replayability here."
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,one negative is that the art on the cards is a bit drab and simply shows the production building in an aerial view images of the units produced by that building would probably have been nicer.
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,"other than that, this is a wellconstructed game that captures the feel of rts."
R3HPPEZN8PVF8L,itplays best with 2 but has variants for 3 or 4. be sure you have someone who can dedicate time to learning the game with you and it will be a solid addition to your collection.
RUXGCM9NPNTKJ,it is what i expected.
RUXGCM9NPNTKJ,"however, it comes with two japanese piece set and no germany piece set."
R15SSWBE0B90XA,these are so cute and perfect for my daughters tea party but they are a little smaller than i expected.
RBZKRFVRSBNFL,"in terms of quality, this set is below paizos typical flip mats."
RBZKRFVRSBNFL,"however, i found the convenience of not having to draw these maps outweighed any other issues i had.the biggest factor in &34should i purchase this?&34 is knowing that it does not include level 1 of thornkeep."
RBZKRFVRSBNFL,"i understand why they did not include it, but it still stinks as thats the most obnoxious level to draw, in my opinion."
RBZKRFVRSBNFL,"ive heard, and read, this being the biggest gripe everyone has with the product so buyer beware.edit came back to generally clean up my wording in the review."
RBZKRFVRSBNFL,no change in opinion on the product.
R3OMUAXDJ88DKW,greatfun game!

RL542MLVRVVKT,they make an ascending sound turned one way and a descending sound turned the other.
RL542MLVRVVKT,"i used to love their crazy sounds, and still do!"
RL542MLVRVVKT,"if you take the tube apart, the white bit doublereed that makes the sound can be blown directly into."
RL542MLVRVVKT,you can make all manner of amusing duckmouse sounds this way.
RL542MLVRVVKT,"for the price, youll get lots of amusement out of it, especially if you work with audio or have kids."
R1R3YLTEVK3DUD,pretty resilient.
R1R3YLTEVK3DUD,stores a lot of cars
R3BQ5NGWATPJMW,ive gone through a lot of these and this one has lasted the longest

R3SJHYZNA1M8I5,what little girl wouldnt love a flowing train behind her full of shimmer!?
R3SJHYZNA1M8I5,very beautiful dress.
R3SJHYZNA1M8I5,"not 5 stars because some things did fall off the dress within the first hour of wearing it, but easily fixable."
R3SJHYZNA1M8I5,"the front middle snowflake fell off, but could easily be repaired with a stitch."
R3SJHYZNA1M8I5,two crystals fell off the wand right away.
R3SJHYZNA1M8I5,"other than that, it is a beautiful dress and the fabric hasnt ripped yet."
R3SJHYZNA1M8I5,"it is the third ""elsa"" dress we own and it is by far my daughters favorite."
R3SJHYZNA1M8I5,she also loves the gloves!
RQ7D2UB1ACD86,son absolutely love it!
RK12D8DTG4G82,that first review doesnt even make sense.

RK12D8DTG4G82,good for organizing.
RK12D8DTG4G82,with dividers.
RK12D8DTG4G82,also good for organising.

RK12D8DTG4G82,like every other awesome holiday gift box theyve made todate.
R3NXUFJBUOYM19,definitely loose in the chestshoulder area.
R3NXUFJBUOYM19,"obviously not great fabric, but most halloween costumes are like that."
R3NXUFJBUOYM19,i bought this for my daughter who turned 4 right after halloween and i probably shouldve gone with a smaller size.
R3NXUFJBUOYM19,had to add my own velcro attachments for the top to make sure she was covered.
R3FJ3FK4HCKKOW,its just a model not a toy.
R3FJ3FK4HCKKOW,it breaks so easily.
R1MS25BAT2I54T,fit perfect.

R1TA83P895DMNH,and none of them are broke.
R1TA83P895DMNH,he plays with them everyday.

RIAHMPQH96YTH,"great quad, came with everything as expected."
RIAHMPQH96YTH,"the 2gb cards run out of space quickly, i recommend getting a 16gb one to be safe."
RIAHMPQH96YTH,"the batteries run out of power in around 7 10 min, depends of the use."
RIAHMPQH96YTH,"bought a pack of 5 additionally and i get a fun hour of flying.crashed it a bunch of times already and it works fine still, no propellers broken.since is very very lightweight, cant be flown well under windy conditions."
RIAHMPQH96YTH,"it has 2 modes  one with more pitch degrees than the other and the mode 2 is more useful under heavy wind, but still youll be battling the weather because it is very lightweight.for the price is very good to start on the quadcopter flying world and to learn about the physics involved."
R14F8A8LVBKZQ9,thank you
RY2LWW8YBLHKC,gave this to my 8year old daughter whos a big fan of unicorns and agnes of despicable me

RE4BK8S2VJSAE,oddly relaxing game.
RE4BK8S2VJSAE,fun for camping.
RC8TZRCXR4LGE,very disappointed with this purchase.
RC8TZRCXR4LGE,"approximately 2 hrs of flight time before one of the motors became inoperable, which obviously prevented further flight."
RC8TZRCXR4LGE,"while to price of the unit was reasonable, 2 hrs of use is unacceptable."
RC8TZRCXR4LGE,"unfortunately, due to summer vacation we missed the return deadline."
RC8TZRCXR4LGE,email to seller went unanswered.
RC8TZRCXR4LGE,lesson learned.
R2OWMUGZPYG53L,got it for my little one...the material is thin and ....its a costume...what do you expect.

R1YVC9K4B4LZJB,very cute and well enjoyed.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,i was looking for a large array of colors to use on my adukt coloring books and failed to notice they were short pencils.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,however once i realized my mistake before receiving them i decided to keep them thinking really how short can they be.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,i have small hands and figured they would be just perfect.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,i was completely wrong.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,these shouldnt even be called pencils.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,they were so short they could fit in my palm without any hang over.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,but i had them and since i didnt want to waste my money i tried to use them.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,they are not very bright and if you want a good smooth color you have to color very hard.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,"that being said you will have to sharpen this ""pencil"" often to get good color and after one sharpening its more like a shard left."
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,not only that but my pencil split 9 out of 10 times and the led fell out most of the time.
R2KS9Q6M2C9I32,needless to say i just threw them away.
R6Z7B54KPWPVU,great little car.
R6Z7B54KPWPVU,very simple and a lot of fun.
R12ABNJL9CA92U,my item is defective.

R3MU3YQSY5L5KS,i absolutely love it!
R10UPREPZZDW3W,"really love the funko pop figures, but downside with this one is that it falls over a lot."
R10UPREPZZDW3W,i think the legs are too skinny to carry the weight of the head.
RE9MH59UGFRGM,my son loves separating all the foods by color and using the tweezers.
RE9MH59UGFRGM,we got this when he was 2 12 and still loves playing with it almost a year later.

R2KMMJFKBZR1JG,so whatever is behind the mariachis will show through.
RD3J1MQAO0EQR,"so many customizable options  definitely a much needed accessory in modding up the esc brushless motor timing, throttle, punch, drag brake, brake force and more."
RD3J1MQAO0EQR,a musthave
RAR5BU5ML091D,no give back.
RAR5BU5ML091D,you have to be highly skilled in yoyos to get it to roll back up.
RAR5BU5ML091D,not a good idea for kids or beginners.

R2IZHZKVNTHMJK,they are too big to ride
R28KT7R3R8OTRA,"this is an adorable product, but the spot where the head of the vacuum meats the swivel weeks is a thin fragile pipe that shaped the second day we got it."
R28KT7R3R8OTRA,we repaired it and it just snapped off again.
R28KT7R3R8OTRA,"my daughter still try to play with it, and it still makes a fun soft noise thats not to annoying but just be warned, it is flimsy."
R1NTQ13LIUB5SL,granddaughter really really liked it but papa thought overpriced for what it is.
R2VQUBJG8BEW2R,such a fun game my sides hurt from laughing
R2HEKRJL4AR8PV,i received these as a free review sample.
R2HEKRJL4AR8PV,"this napkin is a bit pricey considering that there are far nicer ones available for a lot less.granted, these are functional and do the trick plus, folded they are kidsized and even thicker."
R2HEKRJL4AR8PV,the main value is if you are purchasing a complete set of party items that are available from this brand these are a perfect match.
R2HEKRJL4AR8PV,"in fact, you would have to look long and hard to get the same motif in the exact color.know, too, that these are not only for kids."
R2HEKRJL4AR8PV,"they are perfect when combined with plates, cups and other items from this line for baby showers and its a girl celebrations.if you are planning a themed party of celebration where this design is appropriate, grab these along with the rest of the items mentioned."
R2HEKRJL4AR8PV,"if you are looking for just napkins, you may want to continue looking."
RNTB7LYTYL1ZC,my son loves this minion.
RNTB7LYTYL1ZC,he takes it everywhere with him because its the perfect size.
RNTB7LYTYL1ZC,i recommend this for all kids who loves to take stuffed animals with on a trip.
R21GCABW31Z556,these do not break like color pencils.
R21GCABW31Z556,you can twist up and down so when you are not using them they wont break.
R24ELPDSRI4P58,"tattoos were to small i expected them much bigger, color is different as to what you see in the pictures."
R2Q0JI80LYA9IW,stickers were coming off after few days of getting it.

RWRWC2LVDNVMK,"bought this for our grandsons christening, and started him on a coin collection."
RWRWC2LVDNVMK,only thing that could have made it better would have been if the propeller turned.
RWRWC2LVDNVMK,"it is really neat, but not a play toy, it is breakable."
RWRWC2LVDNVMK,"came packed very well in styrofoam, in a gift box."
R1D7PZTOD51RR4,blocks come in a great travel bag and are small enough to tote around.
R1D7PZTOD51RR4,wooden blocks are great not plastic like some others.

R1OPZ0YFPFRLDY,"awesome, fun game!"
R1LXQ531HWN704,a big hit for our 4 year old granddaughter!
R1LXQ531HWN704,it was perfect for her.
R1LXQ531HWN704,"not too fast, since she is so young, but fast enough to let her feel like a successful skater and glamorous too, since anna & elsa were so prominently displayed on the skates."
R1LXQ531HWN704,"she hugged the box that they came in when she opened it, which let us know she was very pleased with this birthday gift."
R1LXQ531HWN704,"we also purchased the matching helmet, which can be used when she starts riding a bike."
R1LXQ531HWN704,great choice and we were so glad she loved it!

RYGMVYF1OV1WL,do you love classic retro gaming?
RYGMVYF1OV1WL,do you love pixel art?
RYGMVYF1OV1WL,"if you can say ""yes"" to these questions then im here to tell you this light rocks."
RYGMVYF1OV1WL,i will say that in truth it seems to only really display 4 solid colors with the rest being shown quickly in transition from one major color to the other.
RYGMVYF1OV1WL,"even so, i love this light."
RYGMVYF1OV1WL,id happily get another three if i had the room for them.
RYGMVYF1OV1WL,it is awesome.

R3FCXRSTJTTCX9,"so soft, very cuddle and just as i remember."
R3FCXRSTJTTCX9,"they arnt a tightly stuffed bear, which makes them great for floppping into silly poses."
R3FCXRSTJTTCX9,very snuggable.

R3JJ65BX9NCREA,my 9 year old was so excited about this product.
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,"we received this through buzz agent about a week ago, but just got around to it last night."
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,"i kept forgetting to pic up chocolate, since it did not come with any to start with."
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,easy to snap together.
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,the instructions for this were very clear.
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,"also the instructions to create the chocolates, i thought, were clear as well.i was impressed with how easy it was to melt the chips."
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,a little hot water and away we went!easy for a 9 year old to work on their own.
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,"this is great, so she can do this with her friends with very little help from an adult."
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,"it makes them feel independent when they dont need any help.i agree with some of the others, that the tool for painting is not that greatest, or easy to use."
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,"i think also a couple more mixing spatulas would be nice, so you are not having to clean off the single spatula over and over again."
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,the molds were cute.
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,"hopefully, we can buy others, but i havent looked yet."
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,we immediately lost one of the sticks probably down the sink and there were only two so..... a pile of paper sticks would be better for this i think.
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,this activity does take a little bit of practice.
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,"the first owl looked terrible, but the second was not too bad!"
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,overall a great little activity for a young girl.
R3JJ65BX9NCREA,"my daughter would give it 5 stars, but i am going with 4 for the reasons above."
R2ZLMRCCNLZN44,great
R1H3X5KN9ATTWR,packaged arrived relatively quickly although not the fastest.
R1H3X5KN9ATTWR,"picture and quality of the puzzle is really nice, would make a great present."
R219RM8BEZ6BZO,i was looking for a wide range of colored pencils i could use for some adult coloring books and some other art projects i had in mind and these ones in particular caught my eye because it looked as if there were plenty of bright and dark colors available.
R219RM8BEZ6BZO,i will say that these are great quality pencils for the price.
R219RM8BEZ6BZO,"the colors come out very smooth and pigmented, especially the darker colors, and you dont have to press down too hard to get that deep color."
R219RM8BEZ6BZO,even if i did press down pretty hard the pencil wouldnt budge or break!
R219RM8BEZ6BZO,"the pencils are in a triangular shape so i would recommend that if you get these, you should also buy the faber castell trio pencil sharpener to be safe."
R219RM8BEZ6BZO,im not sure if any other sharpener for triangularshaped pencils will work so i went ahead and ordered their brand of sharpener.
R219RM8BEZ6BZO,they dont roll away because of their shape either.i am giving it 4 out of 5 stars only because i had to find and order a particular pencil sharpener for these pencils.
R219RM8BEZ6BZO,"i highly suggest you order the both of them together, because i did not and you will definitely need it!"
R3G1TLI5VLZVUV,we love this stuffed animal!
R3G1TLI5VLZVUV,it is super soft.
R3G1TLI5VLZVUV,i have spot cleaned it with a rag several times and there was not any color fading.
RHXZMV57HLRX2,"this was a super fun game, especially for those of us who grew up on batman the animated series."
RHXZMV57HLRX2,i brought this over to a friends house for a girls night in and we had a blast playing and reminiscing about old 90s cartoons.
RHXZMV57HLRX2,"the game consists of just a deck of cards so it was easy to bring anywhere, and i imagine it would also be really fun for kids, probably any old enough to read as its simple and fun."
R7J1HK17W1Z8W,fun game to play with kids...
R2RVYT6XJ0813,doesnt come with stands and the head doesnt swing
R4WIQ8M9WX29I,im in love with her.
R4WIQ8M9WX29I,"i was quite sceptical since there werent any ratings, but i can hardly find any flaws whatsoever."
R4WIQ8M9WX29I,"the only things wrong with her are that the bow is difficult to clip on, and sometimes her stand wont clip in the right place in the pose i want her to be in."
R4WIQ8M9WX29I,"she delivered much faster than expected, and is an amazingly built figure."
R4WIQ8M9WX29I,definitely worth what i payed for her.
R4WIQ8M9WX29I,"the box came in perfect condition, without a dent or scratch, and she isnt scratched at all."
R4WIQ8M9WX29I,"the only flaw in the packaging was that her foot was slightly twisted to the right, but it wasnt a big deal at all."
R4WIQ8M9WX29I,"she comes with everything in the pictures, and is definitely worth getting."
R2ELEODE4FSD0T,grandsonslove it

R2R2BR7W4636T9,my kids love pretend play and unfortunately my 8 year old had grown out of all of the costumes.
R2R2BR7W4636T9,this was a great addition for him at a decent price.
R2R2BR7W4636T9,"not much to the costume, but it fit our needs."
R3HFFVUW059E9I,got this for my four year old son and he loved them.
R3HFFVUW059E9I,he enjoyed building his own dinosaur.
R3HFFVUW059E9I,the cool part though is that he could make it move.
R3HFFVUW059E9I,a really cool learning toy that helps develop your childs learning process.
R3HFFVUW059E9I,they have to follow directions and match parts up.
R3HFFVUW059E9I,like that they can also then build a different dinosaur.
R1QVHOETBFTXVY,good

R3P5X9Z31K4UFE,wheels for easy turning and grooves to keep tiles from moving around.
R3P5X9Z31K4UFE,excellent update on an oldie but goodie.
R5ES1AUZGRWXP,very good
R3BJ54IJL052GK,"arrived before estimated delivery date, just as advertised."
R1X0W7DSL89VZQ,nice toy for my 2 yr old son.
R1X0W7DSL89VZQ,my biggest problem with it is the pockets arent deep enough.
R3IOHZ2U7IRCOT,eight year old son loved this book of dragon airplanes.
R3IOHZ2U7IRCOT,was totally enthralled while building them on his own.
R3IOHZ2U7IRCOT,only wish there was a second book!
R32LWXAK39Q6MK,excellent
R19YX8GW97I3PW,good set to use.
R2LAKXLFMXZ3F8,"omg i just got mine today, it is so beautiful and such an amazing price."
R2LAKXLFMXZ3F8,im going to be telling everyone about this and promoting it on my twitter.
R3HFUSON7POX8I,i have bought one of these for each of my kids.
R3HFUSON7POX8I,"eventually, ill learn and just keep it."
R3HFUSON7POX8I,great interactive toy.
R3HFUSON7POX8I,they have all loved playing with it.
R3HFUSON7POX8I,the only downside is the music it plays goes on for an extremely long time after the child has stopped playing with it.
R3HFUSON7POX8I,"while they are actively playing, i dont mind the noise so much."
R3HFUSON7POX8I,"when they havent touched it in 1015 minutes, and youre listening to the same 30 seconds of music over and over, it starts to get annoying."
R3QBORQ40AMY2M,product did not stay inflated after only 2 uses.
R3QBORQ40AMY2M,very disappointing.
R3QBORQ40AMY2M,"very small 1"" sq."
R3QBORQ40AMY2M,patch included.
R3QBORQ40AMY2M,"now have missed 30day ""return window."""
R248G73M0RNCM9,"i have 4 girls, ages 711 and they all enjoyed playing with this set, although the 11 year old was really just hanging out with her younger sisters and it was a little young for her, even she enjoyed it and said she wished they had them when she was littler."
R248G73M0RNCM9,"they liked how many phrases she had, all of the accessories that came with it and the ability to change up her hair, too."
R248G73M0RNCM9,"i like that i can purchase other sets and they will all work together so they can play as one big group, or in twos, or by themselves."
R248G73M0RNCM9,there was a lot of room for imaginative play and i really like that.
R248G73M0RNCM9,"all in all, my girls thought them to be a lot of fun and i think these are going to be very popular during the holiday season!"
R248G73M0RNCM9,"the product has been provided by vtech so you could experience it with your family however, the thoughts and opinions are all your own."
R18YZ0AWWFBYY4,love it!
R18YZ0AWWFBYY4,came when it was supposed to.
R18YZ0AWWFBYY4,all good
R2S11C0387K1QQ,"when i received it, it was broke."
R2S11C0387K1QQ,it also did not come in the box and was smaller than what i thought.
R244CECUAF0H52,exactly as advertised.

R3I1XWLZ1QFDY7,grandson loves it.
R3I1XWLZ1QFDY7,just what i expected.
R18AVCT2NESFW2,"my 4 year old and i were very excited when we got this toy, we couldnt wait to be ""scientists""."
R18AVCT2NESFW2,i am so thankful that i had some vinegar and baking soda in my cabinets or i would have had one sad little girl.
R18AVCT2NESFW2,"the kit was adorable, very cute and durable peices, but thats all it was."
R18AVCT2NESFW2,i was expecting to have projects to do.
R18AVCT2NESFW2,they packed a little catalog of experiments that you can try with things you have to buy.
R18AVCT2NESFW2,"as nice as the kit was, i think it was a little misleading."
R18AVCT2NESFW2,i receivered this pride tin exchange for my honest review.
R380A5QW7F8LMO,works great with what we already have and my boy 3 years old loves being able to make lots of long and different tracks.
R1CWYDES9X0A7,i am hoping for a grandaughter... started collecting them for that purpose.
R1CWYDES9X0A7,love these dolls a whole lot!!!
R1CWYDES9X0A7,!
R20IA5LFHK3PY0,fun.
R20IA5LFHK3PY0,just like pin the tail on the donkey.
R20IA5LFHK3PY0,poster and stickers are well made.
R20IA5LFHK3PY0,kids loved having their names on their sticker.
RZ2Z12GZ9M88Z,kids love these but some were doubled.
RZ2Z12GZ9M88Z,we got 2 marios and 2 luigis in the bag as well as 2 yoshis.
R3KZZKC3HMKPU8,not worth buying.
R3KZZKC3HMKPU8,i purchased these for my grandaughters and when i took them to be blown up at the local floral department everyone of them popped once they where filled with helium.
R37AK3YSX4IZMM,i love it and my grandson will when he gets use to it.
R37AK3YSX4IZMM,the horn was a little loud therefore it frighten him and he wont go near it it at the moment.
R37AK3YSX4IZMM,but i believe he will be fine will it in a little while.thanks
R30O019LFGOTH9,my product is not working .
R30O019LFGOTH9,broken arrived
RYJGECCNHRN6F,my daughter loves this!
RYJGECCNHRN6F,this is such a pretty doll and quality is really great.
R2VHDS6PSEA7TJ,perfect condition.
R2VHDS6PSEA7TJ,"package was damp, but no harm came to the card."
R3CTSTP01QCUA0,we were so excited to receive our insect lore live butterfly kit in the mail.
R3CTSTP01QCUA0,we purchased it along with a book about butterflies for our two toddlers.
R3CTSTP01QCUA0,the kit was easy to understand as well as the coupon for butterfly redemption.
R3CTSTP01QCUA0,"the only issues i had are, they do not ship to hawaii where i live and you have to pay shipping on your butterflies."
R3CTSTP01QCUA0,it is written in the product description i just did not see it.
R3CTSTP01QCUA0,so we did not get to complete the kit however i was pleased with the quality of the butterfly house.
R3CTSTP01QCUA0,we ended up catching other bugs and feeding those in the butterfly house.
R3313U3X4F4L5I,wonderful collection.
RDX0O0WXX2RLM,higher quality than i expected!
RUACEZFKEQWPC,love it
R1BP5LA7P4JR8L,i was pleased with the product.
RSYFZWRSDLG6D,just as described.
R20BFB00GN5OVS,very useful insert.
R20BFB00GN5OVS,the manhattan project has lots of pieces you need to access during game play and this insert keeps things much more organized than using bowlsbags.
R20BFB00GN5OVS,"assembly was a bit...annoying and i had to start over once because everything was backwards, but total time spent on putting this together was less than 30 minutes."
R20BFB00GN5OVS,"thats a lie, technically it took an hour, but thats counting waiting for the glue to dry."
R20BFB00GN5OVS,"if you spent a childhood putting together legos, this will be a piece of cake."
R20BFB00GN5OVS,"definitely use glue, it will make this much sturdier than without."
R3PLBCRKUOC1HI,the wooden tools work well but the modeling clay is dry and unusable.
R3PLBCRKUOC1HI,definitely not worth the price.
R38OZ9N6ISXIQD,what can i say?
R38OZ9N6ISXIQD,its full of cats!
R38OZ9N6ISXIQD,in funny positions.
R38OZ9N6ISXIQD,saying anything more would just belabor the point.
R3FT99Z1L8OXKN,they do what they need to.
R3FT99Z1L8OXKN,its a score pad.
R123RYI82BKU3Z,i seriously cant recommend this modeling knife enough to anyone that builds plamo.
R123RYI82BKU3Z,"the fact that it comes with a curved blade is a big deal, and the weighted base of the knife helps keep you balanced and alleviates extreme strain when youre trimming parts."
R123RYI82BKU3Z,ive had mine for a long while now and havent snapped a blade knock on wood for the life of the knife.
R123RYI82BKU3Z,"my old xacto blade would snap every so often and this is a big moneysaver for me in that sense.it does take a little bit of getting used to if youre switching over from the typical xacto since, again, this blade is weighted at the end but once youve been using it for a while it becomes an extension of your hand."
R123RYI82BKU3Z,"plus, as i mentioned before, it comes with a variety of blades which are great for different types of builds.highly highly recommended!"
R123RYI82BKU3Z,well worth the price point!
R15RUOB3DZK76A,fragile.
R15RUOB3DZK76A,not great for younger kids.
R3D3WYXR2Z3TLH,i purchased this for a four year old boy.
R3D3WYXR2Z3TLH,he has been playing with it outside since it arrived and its still in perfect condition!
R1C88PWS4FFD25,these are great blocks!!
R1C88PWS4FFD25,very comparable to the more expensive magnatiles.
R1C88PWS4FFD25,my kids play with these all the time.
R1C88PWS4FFD25,this is a toy i think they will keep for a long time.
R1C88PWS4FFD25,i wish we got these when they were younger.
R1C88PWS4FFD25,there are so many creative things to do with these.
R1C88PWS4FFD25,"they make little houses for their other toys, they use on fridge  awesome!"
RTWAUHD7JOH13,cool
R1T68MXXNZR4WM,"cute lamp, matched my 3year olds room great."
R1T68MXXNZR4WM,"lamp shade is a bit flimsy though, and will not last if touched alot."
R1T68MXXNZR4WM,overall good purchase.
R3D7DTW88OTLL8,needs to be more sturdy very nice
RLMNXVXJNK0LV,"adorable, colorful, nice size mediumnot too small, nice quality, packaged very well, and delivered very quickly."
RGEVUFDKZMGWA,broke within the hour
R3PR1XNATIQ9OX,daughter loved them!

RGGNYOB5ESKIP,love this table and chairs it is sturdy and cute!
RGGNYOB5ESKIP,well made!
RTFLXTFHQEZNG,everything was great.
R2SMRZW7MW8WYC,a bit difficult for a smart 3 year old!
RAULGDO331VOP,this puzzle is very colorful and challenging.
RAULGDO331VOP,"it took two seven year olds and two five years old, plus grandpa two days to put together."
RAULGDO331VOP,kept them busy and entertained.
RAULGDO331VOP,pieces are solid enough to last several put togethers and put aways without bending.
R28H20M5HKPA57,thank you its beautiful
R33UNQ5Q6JJ8XR,"i will be honest  i expected my girls to love this as much as the frozen game, but for some reason it was not off the charts for them."
R33UNQ5Q6JJ8XR,"there were fun features, but mostly they checked out the different features in the game and moved on to different games."
R33UNQ5Q6JJ8XR,"i liked the reading concepts that it pushed to them, and that is perhaps where the problem is my 9 year old is a strong reader and older than the game age range."
R33UNQ5Q6JJ8XR,"my other daughter is just 3 and still needing to learn her letters, so i would think that this is a game that in the future she will find entertaining."
R33UNQ5Q6JJ8XR,and as much as i am ok with boys playing with girls games... they just have no interest!
R4DHVRL47HMJG,soft and nice
R1WSPNX6R5Y2EE,great value.
R1WSPNX6R5Y2EE,easy enough for a 3 year old to use alone and easy clean up.
R3W0NHUAWEXUOS,grand daughter loved it
R3GEERG7VMLJ89,this card is so amazing!
R3GEERG7VMLJ89,also came early and in mint condition.
R3GEERG7VMLJ89,"love card very much,i will never trade it!"
R1RBGJOOVQX54L,one of the best cards in the game.
R1RBGJOOVQX54L,any deck that can summon bls should be running him.
R1RBGJOOVQX54L,his effects are devastating to the opponent and can often steal games after being drawn.
R1RBGJOOVQX54L,most utilized in chaos decks since they have many light and dark targets to banish from the graveyard to summon him.
R1RBGJOOVQX54L,a must for shaddolls and burning abyss.
REA7ZKSVR33J7,son loves these blocks.
REA7ZKSVR33J7,i like the bag.
RODKACR2ZJ1G0,love legos.
RODKACR2ZJ1G0,they make 40 year old men sit on the floor.
RRSHC1S75XCUW,cheaply made
R39E036H1CLQ2L,very beautiful doll.
R39E036H1CLQ2L,each pieces of clothes are dedicate and wellmade.
R39E036H1CLQ2L,her hair is really soft.
R39E036H1CLQ2L,it worth to spend this amount of money on it.
R3HOR457ZUIHZA,this works as described and is a blast to use.
R3HOR457ZUIHZA,only knocks on it are that it charges slowly and dies pretty quickly.
R3HOR457ZUIHZA,"also, every time i use it theres about a 14 cup of water inside the boat that i have to dump out."
R3HOR457ZUIHZA,the lid does not seal properly and i think the hull leaks where it is seamed together at the bow.
R3HOR457ZUIHZA,"i usually just dump it out and let it dry after each use and because the battery takes soo long to charge, it is typically dry y the next use anyways."
R3HOR457ZUIHZA,fun toy tho for cheap enough $
R10HPVJMKCRQ4A,if only every pack had an epic rare.
R31L61NX0Y5RTJ,very dissappointing toy.
R31L61NX0Y5RTJ,the whole boat falls apart once you open the package.
R31L61NX0Y5RTJ,it doesnt even float because the parts fall apart and water gets in and sinks the boat.
R8QCPF6VX14MD,its very pretty when you first open it.
R8QCPF6VX14MD,after playing with it for awhile it remains sparkley but the colors mix into more of a light pinkish purple color.
R3VD1QE6EIHFMI,my 4 & 2 year old grandkids love this pool.
R3VD1QE6EIHFMI,"also, it is very easy to drain."
R17AZJNWCX4AUB,amazing price!
R17AZJNWCX4AUB,"you do have to assemble the figures and there was one that was missing a part, but i still think it was an incredible deal."
RXX2VZ9OF2QB6,"i like the amount of carts and the bad thing is that i could not choose which box to choose, yet i recommend it to all of excellent quality"
R1DOVFJLU5J01H,my girls really enjoy playing with this set with their 18 inch dolls!
R3INHEBKUPCC34,its great!
R3INHEBKUPCC34,"it pushes very easy, the kids love riding in it."
R3INHEBKUPCC34,its a bit heavy so wouldnt recommend to bring up and down stairs
R9SHUVZ4M1H6Q,works great for school project
RR9O3D3032E8R,nice car
R30FF5ZJ2JEQE3,these tracks have plastic bits that mate with the keyhole slots instead of wood.
R30FF5ZJ2JEQE3,kiddo has already broken one.
RE4WWBV1PF5PT,came early soft adorable
R205JW1YHPKZQ0,stickers are great.
R205JW1YHPKZQ0,tattoos are cute and go on easy.
R205JW1YHPKZQ0,they dont last very long.
R205JW1YHPKZQ0,some came off within a couple hours.
R205JW1YHPKZQ0,i liked that most of the stickers and tattoos are actual characters faces.
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,the only child who did not have an inside out character was overjoyed at getting this one.
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,he ran all over the house showing it to everyone.
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,bing bong was always his favorite.
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,bing bong has candy in his eyes.
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,he smells like cotton candy according to the boy.
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,"he smells like a plush toy to me.his sister informed him that in the movie, bing bong cries candy."
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,he can see the candy in his eyes and it utterly charmed by it.
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,he has been shaking bing bong but no candy comes out.this is a great character and a lot of fun.
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,it is amazing what this toy did for a small boy who is not happy or interested in talking about his feelings.
R2LACUA90Z4GFO,this boy needed an imaginary friend more than anyone else i know.
R28JX0O54YZBH8,great received quickly everything as expected
R3QCRQ241RPP9T,arrived way ahead of schedule.
R3QCRQ241RPP9T,really happy with the product.
R2LHFV7UNTZJY7,what great blocks these are!
R2LHFV7UNTZJY7,they are quality wooden blocks and my son has a blast building with them.
R2LHFV7UNTZJY7,the container is fun and easy to cary around with the handle.
R2LHFV7UNTZJY7,"its a nice little set of shapes.disclaimer i received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
R1JTG012JJY9CP,i love the fact that they dont chop my sons adorable pudgy three year old fingers in to pieces on the floor.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,and he cant cut my hair while im sleeping.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,both great things.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,but they are really hard for him to use.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,"when i use these scissors, having had years of practice, including cutting my own hair for school pictures in the second grade i am able to cut paper."
R1JTG012JJY9CP,when my three year old tries to use them we end up with a bunch of paper that just looks like it was mauled by a toothless person.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,without the drool.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,with practice he is getting better at cutting but its taking some time.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,and a fair amount of whining.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,theeeey doooooont woooooork.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,heeeeeelp meeeeee.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,but i have high hopes of him getting this down pat.
R1JTG012JJY9CP,soon.
R1NJ5GY7UBK4BH,this is awesome
RJBQYCYB225DD,nice puppet tree.
RJBQYCYB225DD,very good customer service!
RJBQYCYB225DD,!
R3GBTOJN8D9XX2,i would give it 5 stars if the boards had little indents in them where the chips fit.
R3GBTOJN8D9XX2,they slide around aot and my kids get really frustrated.
R3GBTOJN8D9XX2,otherwise its been s fun game for my 2 and 4 year old.
R3GBTOJN8D9XX2,the 4 year d can play.
R3GBTOJN8D9XX2,the 2 year old liked sliding the chips out and throwing them everywhere.
R3T80YZ3HP8LHM,my three year old son has an addiction to shopping carts.
R3T80YZ3HP8LHM,he loved this combo of a shopping cart & car.
R259BJ2LKSCR3L,these were great for my office christmas party.
R259BJ2LKSCR3L,i bought several packs and removed the winning cards from all but one set of them.
R259BJ2LKSCR3L,i then gave each employee two scratcher cards at the start of our party and at the end they scratched them and the winner got an amazon fire tv.
R259BJ2LKSCR3L,it was a huge hit with the staff and i think well do it again next year.
RPUWP8SQRYT57,good
R3LE0OYLJQIBZU,this is a giant coloring book.
R3LE0OYLJQIBZU,"so e coloribg books say giant and they mean more pages.. not this coloring book, its fantastic for the price."

R9PKFS7E8YSNA,"my daughter, my nieces and it seems like the entire neighborhood."
R9PKFS7E8YSNA,the cash register came as expected and the kids were thrilled.
R1OR4KZWMSY39U,great price
R35NDHXVDUFVE4,"be advised, you are buying only 1 box."
R35NDHXVDUFVE4,it is becoming very common on amazon to show a picture that is not exactly representative of the items you think you will be receiving.
R35NDHXVDUFVE4,this price is for 1 box.
R1HUYJ6P8E6UPZ,very nice looking score pads good quality.
R1HUYJ6P8E6UPZ,matched the cards with birds that i had.
R1HUYJ6P8E6UPZ,very pleased with my purchase!

R3L6Q78MW7M263,i regret buying these.
R3L6Q78MW7M263,not a happy camper.
R1SNHLEH1LXRRA,not worth the prize for the size of this toy
R19HLGL0JFB65L,exactly as pictured and the kids love them.

RQ3K80CG91R3I,my son loves his music box!
RQ3K80CG91R3I,its easy to hold and plays a good amount of songs.
RQ3K80CG91R3I,must have if your little one loves music
R3S17GKSDU21NP,junk
R77H55GS1WKYF,these blocks are wonderful for small aged kids!
R77H55GS1WKYF,they are small enough to hold in their hands and they can use their imagination for building small homes.
R77H55GS1WKYF,the only thing that i would try to improve on is the storage bag... not that its a big deal but it can be a bit larger.
R29JOJ0KGVTSG,nice gift
R325UHUOYLG7NK,well worth the great price !
R2SSCG0L9D3U00,loved it
RWZ385DAWCTJR,its amazing that such a compact game can offer so much fun!
RWZ385DAWCTJR,we have a family dinner night that usually concludes with some kind of game.
RWZ385DAWCTJR,"we have a large span of ages, from 29 to 79 and we usually have at least 6 players, so it can be tricky to find a game that fits our criteria."
RWZ385DAWCTJR,"it has to be somewhat easy to play, not too fast paced and, of course, fun."
RWZ385DAWCTJR,"this game fits the bill, especially in the fun department."
RWZ385DAWCTJR,its easy to learn but does involve choice and chances since it is a dice game.
RWZ385DAWCTJR,"you can fit this game in to whatever time constraints you are under,which is also a plus."
RWZ385DAWCTJR,there is also an alternate game that changes up play.
RWZ385DAWCTJR,we actually just tried this one last night and we almost like it better than the original game.
RWZ385DAWCTJR,i would definitely recommend this game to anyone
R2OS0C9PU10RP,excellent
R2G2DULB18W35O,if only every pack had a mythic rare
R3J262GESI93P7,absolutely fantastic kit and price is excellent!
R3J262GESI93P7,just slap your receiver on there and you are ready to go.
R1WH1U4G1S50RR,do not buy.
R1WH1U4G1S50RR,mine came broken.
R1WH1U4G1S50RR,"the pin had fallen off, and no glue will keep it on."
R28L7GBC1HVXW2,very fun light bluffing game.
R3QQXGILOBP5GI,my grandddaughter is the envy of the community pool.
R3QQXGILOBP5GI,"she, and the other swimmers, love it."
R170FT29UP8XQT,it was really fun but it glitches out and trimming it doesnt work.
R170FT29UP8XQT,it lasted me about 10 days.
R170FT29UP8XQT,it is not good for outside.
R170FT29UP8XQT,over all i doesnt really work good.
R14A9UA4963BHV,took to universal studios and they work well at both parks for the harry potter interactive areas.
R14A9UA4963BHV,these are the same ones you can buy at universal studios.
R45ZWS29FNM8,"bought as gag gift, but kids love to play with it!"
RWT3GRRM7X4J1,i got this for my niece whom is one and she started kissing it immediately her mother almost cried because it is our movie we grew up watching and it was a great feeling btw if u dont know the movie this guy may seem a little ugly to u ha
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,"i live in a touristy beachside town in the south and living here, my family descends upon me in the summer, including all the little ones."
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,"and because i live here, everyone looks to me to be wellprepared and the kids always look to me to have toys and amusements and little entertainments and then they get upset with me when i dont have them."
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,"and i dont have kids of my own, so theres no reason for me to have entertainments for them."
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,"so when i saw this fire truck, i thought it may give the smaller teacup humans something to do while the older ones played board games or went outside to play backyard games.the truck arrived in a welllabeled and sturdy box with a handle attached to the top so that it could be easily carried around, even by the little ones."
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,the truck itself is fairly sturdy.
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,it uses 3 aa batteries not included in order to light up and play sounds.
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,there is a rotating piece on the top and the six wheels on the bottom roll fairly easily.
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,theres another set of wheels that can be uncovered with a removal of the cap on the underside of the truck.
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,"although its a nice truck, unfortunately, due to small pieces, its not suitable for the littles under three years old who were the ones who really wanted to play with it and the littles over three lost interest in it fairly quickly because it didnt have enough compartments and moving features."
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,i dont know if this is indicative of the item or i just happen to have a very fussy family and i have no insight on kids as a general population.
R1U06F9MW27AQ7,"nice truck, but not a popular item in my household.i received this truck for free in exchange for a genuine critique."
R4CEQWOTHC9VK,was a little smaller than expected
R291SASG3J9H79,"my son starts kindergarden in a week, so it feels a little late for kindergarden prep in our house this time around."
R291SASG3J9H79,"however, he felt quite special that this package was for him to use!"
R291SASG3J9H79,"with in about 15 minutes of opening the word whammer, he informed me that he can spell cat and dog!"
R291SASG3J9H79,that seems to be decent results.
R291SASG3J9H79,"however, he does already know all his letters, so that it probably a help."
R291SASG3J9H79,this will help him fully comprehend which sound is made by each letter.
R291SASG3J9H79,i am sure that this will be used throughout his first year in school.
R3DOUMCZRDN4N2,cute for party bags
RMTYZ4WGRMVCJ,poor quality.
RMTYZ4WGRMVCJ,some connection holes are loose and the battery has to be moved around till a good connection is made.
RMTYZ4WGRMVCJ,other ports are hard to connect at all.
RMTYZ4WGRMVCJ,would not buy again.
R125PIQH3Q5KLT,"maybe i had too high expectations, but this product is not really worth the money.first the dome with the stars is barely resembling the night sky i was not expecting a 3d projector, but some sort of realistic image."
R125PIQH3Q5KLT,instead the dome is practically a film of plastic with transparent areas to resemble a star effect not even my 5 year old was impressed by the effect.
R125PIQH3Q5KLT,"also the dome come off easily.the second feature is the projector...oh boy, what a joke."
R125PIQH3Q5KLT,"there are few disks, each contains 56 images."
R125PIQH3Q5KLT,"the projector is reflecting light on these, and magnify them."
R125PIQH3Q5KLT,"the problem is that the size of the image is ridicule at most it fits on a dinner plate unless you want to project it at further distance, where you will loose most of the details, because the image and the lens are not made to project it at great distance like from the floor to the ceiling?"
R125PIQH3Q5KLT,"wow....a mediocre product not even a child would enjoy this, to be honest.much better to invest in a portable projector, and hook it up to a pocket computer like a raspberry pi, that stream real nasa pictures i did make one spending less than 150 dollars, but you get a 1080p resolution that fill most of your ceiling, which is a whole different level from what you get from this item.unless your kids are very small less than 5, they wont be really impressed, and for an adult, dont even bother."
R1TFR18SK11Z7B,beautiful dark blue
R1UYESYCWP2F69,bought it for son.
R1UYESYCWP2F69,he loves it.
R1UYESYCWP2F69,very pleased
R226DMHP8WF276,i got these for the kids to take camping.
R226DMHP8WF276,"theyre just for play really, but the kids love them."
R226DMHP8WF276,"they have a breakaway cord, which is great for tree climbers prone to getting caught on branches."
R226DMHP8WF276,"theyre plastic, but sturdy."
R226DMHP8WF276,"now that i think of it, we may have lost the compasses already."
R226DMHP8WF276,"they have a little magnification, but again really for play."
R226DMHP8WF276,"for 5 bucks, they were a great treat for the trip."
R226DMHP8WF276,the kids climbed trees and birdwatched while we setup camp.
R226DMHP8WF276,they brought these and their buckets to the beach yesterday too.
R3ERGSTJGZ305,missing part
RTHST7DY2X63X,these balls are great.

RTHST7DY2X63X,"they work good for a general foot sole massage, too."
R3J27XP9ER5ZQO,this is an exact replica of the infamous grave digger and anybody who has ever heard of or seen monster trucks knows grave digger.
R3J27XP9ER5ZQO,you dont have be a loyal monster truck fan to love grave digger.
R3J27XP9ER5ZQO,how can you not love this truck?
R3J27XP9ER5ZQO,its a shiny purple with the decals that are consistent with the ones worn by the legendary monster truck.this is an extremely rugged electric vehicle on extremely high tires.
R3J27XP9ER5ZQO,flames on the side with front and rear suspension with shock absorbers so you can stick even the higher jumps without damaging the body of the vehicle.the tires are very wide and grooved so they ride on any terrain.
R3J27XP9ER5ZQO,"it goes a nice speed and can turn back, front, right, or left so there is no place that has to go untraveled.with rechargeable batteries grave digger can provide hours of fun everyday and you will not need to constantly buy replacement batteries."
R3J27XP9ER5ZQO,this would be a gift for a girl or boy because everybody enjoys a fast vehicle with flashing lights.i received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.

RLCMYARF8L8X9,great
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,this is my first elaborate action figure purchase in this price range and size.
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,i have to say im stunned by the quality and detail.
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,"as a professional western artist and a batman comicsmovie fan, my worlds collided with this figure when i first saw it by sheer chance."
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,its now august and ive been squirming since my preorder in may.
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,well worth the wait.
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,the posing options are so numerous that i was surprised anyone could come up with this many.
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,the minute detail is unbelievable.
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,i have a closet full of 19th century western wear.
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,"now this makes me want to add a few things to it.the one thing that bothers, and certainly nothing id reduce stars for, is the clear plastic base that comes with this."
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,its sparkly reflective quality seems to go against this rustic oldstyle steampunkish figure.
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,im going to see if i can find another in metal or at least in a dark color so that it blends with the figure without calling attention.
R3H5XAPZ2NJMLD,"if anyones been collecting these for a while and has suggestions, i hope i see the comment here."
RB386M2PVYAFY,"i bought this game to play with my grandchildrens ages 6 to 12 but there are no instructions to play the game like take out wrenched ankle, do i need to pay extra for the cards and the other bits."
R1SFTTO9ZFGZIO,big hit for my 8yos birthday.
R1SFTTO9ZFGZIO,he also received the orange one as a gift from someone else.
R1SFTTO9ZFGZIO,"of the two, this one is his favorite."
R24NN3UN0EOML3,my son is 4 12. it fits perfectly.
R24NN3UN0EOML3,he is still in 4t clothes.
R24NN3UN0EOML3,he will only be able to wear it this year for halloween.
R24NN3UN0EOML3,thats ok. he may be into other things next year.
R24NN3UN0EOML3,he loves the button to make it roar!
R1S6YJ11BCUG83,excellent items with fast shipping!
R21D6QW61HLTWM,grand kids loved it!
R2Y39GQAZH1MQZ,nice set for my 3 year old twins.
R2Y39GQAZH1MQZ,they ask to play with them everyday.
R2Y39GQAZH1MQZ,cant beat having its own storage.
R2Y39GQAZH1MQZ,we have combined this set with another smaller set and the container still has room for more pieces.
R1ZYSSKOWCZOY2,"awesome, especially for a nerdy waitress xp stuck em all over my booklet and have been getting compliments since then!"
R16FHIZHRIRFEF,nice and quiet fun to fly right out the box...was gonna give it away but this ones a keeper.

R1HR5HLVDFEQCW,!
R15LDIX3GYQK0T,"very cute, works for babies may use a strap to buckle them in and my 3 year old loves it too skinny legs."
R15LDIX3GYQK0T,"as others suggested, i will seal it or paint it because it appears to be untreated."
R1UY4BMTN6M5LK,this was much smaller than i expected.
R1UY4BMTN6M5LK,my 2 year old wasnt really able to manipulate it well.
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,put this awesome copter on your kids christmas list!
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,"it takes a little trail and error before you master the controls, but it is most definitely a fun toy."
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,even the adults enjoyed it.
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,the body is very light  plastic and styrofoam.
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,i was a little worried about how it was made but it seems to be holding up to rough play quite well.
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,the controls allow you to lift it straight up and fly in just about any direction you choose.
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,one word of warning  read the directions thoroughly before use.
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,get to know the controls as they are very touchy.
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,this would not be a good toy for a very young child.
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,i would say 14 and up for sure.
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,"i love that it is made for the outdoors, but watch windy days."
R3UVVPPU6MW0QQ,it doesnt do well at all if its windy outside.
R3AG6TN0VBV14I,"got what i paid for, son loves it."
R3AG6TN0VBV14I,very simple robot to plane transformer.
R1J82S4Y9O26PJ,ok
R3H2OVI1USCJTP,i was very disappointed with the quality of this table.
R3H2OVI1USCJTP,the benches bowed with little weight applied to them.
R3H2OVI1USCJTP,thank goodness my 2 year old only weighs 26 lbs.
R3H2OVI1USCJTP,i really would like to return this and get something sturdier.
R2IYLNU9OHU0S5,so much fun!
R2IYLNU9OHU0S5,kids love it as well as.
R2IYLNU9OHU0S5,fast to learn and play.
R2IYLNU9OHU0S5,"for added fun, have everyone read the cards aloud when they play them buy 2 in case you need to have more people join."
R2IYLNU9OHU0S5,supports up to 9 players with 2 boxes.
R2IYLNU9OHU0S5,"every group i have played with had others watch and want to play the next game, and since i only had one box, some had to sit out."
R2PJJEQNIG1NSK,these were a hit at my sons birthday party.
R2PJJEQNIG1NSK,i was surprised how well made the bags were and the quality of the coloring books was great.
R2PJJEQNIG1NSK,i just added some big hero 6 rings and these were done.
R2PJJEQNIG1NSK,great buy.
R32R001DBSNIE7,i was so excited to find this at such a great price.
R32R001DBSNIE7,local school supply stores wanted triple to quadruple this price.
R32R001DBSNIE7,this came with everything i needed.
R32R001DBSNIE7,i remember having one of these in kindergarten and wanted my home schooled son to have one as well.
R32R001DBSNIE7,he cant wait to get to the calendar in the morning to change the date and weather.

R1HCBF0RDNT96F,love it
R1RHPBFTB3LEQH,thank you
RHSBT08EC3F7R,i got this for my niece to play with when she is here.
RHSBT08EC3F7R,"she is 8 and loves monster high!overall, this is a cute set."
RHSBT08EC3F7R,"the colors are vibrant and the little figure is cute, but as others have mentioned mega bloks are sometimes iffy."
RHSBT08EC3F7R,"we did encounter a few problems with blocks staying together in a tight fit, and unfortunately weve encountered that issue with every mega bloks set weve gotten."
RHSBT08EC3F7R,"some of the black bricks in the car, just didnt want to fit together."
RHSBT08EC3F7R,"on the flip side, i had blocks that were so tightly fit we couldnt even pry them apart!"
RHSBT08EC3F7R,"that makes it hard for kids to view these as play sets, as opposed to modelsmeaning once you get it together you dont play with it or move it."
RHSBT08EC3F7R,not what my kids are looking for in a toy like this.while i like the whole monster high conceptsometimes the quality of the sets leaves something to be desired.
R2HD6VRSTJIKON,perfect for my native american mini garden.
R2MQBTVQ3YGHVE,so much fun.
R2MQBTVQ3YGHVE,great game night opener.
R2MQBTVQ3YGHVE,should have bought two boxes!
RNXLX2JCQC06S,these were great for our saturday morning cartoon themed brunch.
RNXLX2JCQC06S,i like that they came in separate pieces so we could decorate the entire room and ditch the happy birthday party.
RNXLX2JCQC06S,flimsy but sturdy enough for two uses.
R1NTTL6M0ZQ4X8,the puzzle is amazing.
R1NTTL6M0ZQ4X8,ive been to budapest and the image ressembles me of a picture i took when i was there.the seller is very professional.
R1NTTL6M0ZQ4X8,the package arrived many days earlier than expected.
R1NTTL6M0ZQ4X8,no problem at all.thanks so much.

R1QCWJWFKSP1W5,thanks!
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,this bear is incredibly soft!
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,i was going to save it as a gift for my daughter for the holidays but i caved.
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,its so cute i had to give it to her early.set up is easy.
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,"you install the app and once youve created an account, it walks you through it."
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,"youll be prompted to install an update, then restart your pet.pros very soft plush material can be used on android or apple devices  i have an iphone & my husband has a samsung and both worked well record & receive messages your child can respond to you over the cloud extras in your childs menu  lullabies baba black sheep, this old man, twinkletwinkle little star, welsh lullaby that have multiple settings  5, 8, 10, 12, & 15 minutes  low, medium, high volume  2 readalong stories  barnyard sounds game  access your childs messages to send to your cloudpetcons needs more indepth instructions or walkthrough on the app for invite recipients  i helped my husband figure it out, but im pretty sure id need to show my mother or anyone else not as techsavvy how to do it in person p.s."
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,"dont tell my mom i said that about her   you need to manually go into your childs menu in the app to send any messages youve recorded or that others have sent this could also be a &34pro&34, but i was under the impression that if i sent it on my device while in bluetooth range, it would send automatically dont hold down the blue button too long while playing a message or it shorts out perhaps  youll know if thats happened if you hear a feedback sound and the buttons are no longer responsive."
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,"this can be fixed by turning the cloudpet off, then back on again."
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,also easily avoided if you watch your kiddo with it & by not holding the button longer than necessary 10 second record time for momdad recording vs 18 seconds for your child to record a response.
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,"it would be nice to have an extended option for messages sent to child as well if you are using the app to set it up, watch for the heart to blink twice on your pet to confirm it has been connected...the written instructions tell you this however, the application does not.my daughter and i are really enjoying this toy, as well as the rest of my family."
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,"i hope they come out with some additional updates soon, but i am just as equally pleased with what this product can do."
R2F7D9N3SSQC20,"i purchased this product at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviewi believe this product is of sound quality, but it does need a couple of small tweaks to make it closer to flawless.re using the app to set it up, watch for the heart to blink twice on your pet to confirm it has been connected...the written instructions tell you this however, the application does not."

R1DMK2GCSLRKJE,works for one kid.
R1DMK2GCSLRKJE,not multiple for sure.
R2MCW5CB0SP9P1,my son loves his new cleats!
R1H34WDRK144TA,this is very cheaply built.
R1H34WDRK144TA,the body is flimsy plastic and the onoff switch works sometime.would never buy another one.
R267AYQSC0SGAE,too thin.
R267AYQSC0SGAE,very disappointed.
R267AYQSC0SGAE,paper rips very quickly when wet .
R267AYQSC0SGAE,only good for older child say 6 or 7 who has more control of the water and brush..but upper age group may find them very boring.
R267AYQSC0SGAE,i will not buy again.
RIJM0K0TUSTF7,great neck strap
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,"first i gotta say, i bought this at target for $3 in that little section you see when you first walk in the store."
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,i purchased it there july 2015. perfect for on the go.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,"we use this at restaurants, at the pool, waiting for car service."
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,the pieces are smalltravel game size.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,"there are 4 boards 4 34"" x 4""."
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,the 60 dime sized tokens are cardboard.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,the 30 little picture cards are playing card paper material.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,the boards are double sided.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,we are a family of 4 with a 3yo and 6yo.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,one drawback for the parents is that the names of the characters are not on the picture cards but if youre kids are like mine and know every disney character imaginable then you wont have a problem if you dont know the name or get the name wrong.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,our 3yo was able to find the matching picture on the boards.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,the pictures on the board are small but id expect that from a travel size game.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,they seem to stand up to getting a little wet as we play this at the pool.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,our 3yo will have the tendency to bend the picture cards.
R3KZ5M6O2YABG,and it comes in a reuseable zip lock package.
R34YFEA1RP5WAE,we received this from bzzagent.
R34YFEA1RP5WAE,tried it out first just to see how easy it would be to use.
R34YFEA1RP5WAE,takes some time to get used too.
R34YFEA1RP5WAE,we do like that the links are tighter than with finger knitting.
R34YFEA1RP5WAE,once you get the hang of it its fun and easy to use.
RV34JAR6A7IKO,great offer and deal.not a single duplicate in the pack.my daughter was very satisfied with this as her starter set.

R19OG1B6TZG7TS,"i was confused, however, because i did not receive the 5 huge bases, as the product describes having."
R19OG1B6TZG7TS,"i received the 20 medium bases, a pack of 10 large bases, and a pack of 9 additional large bases."
R19OG1B6TZG7TS,could i make it work?
R19OG1B6TZG7TS,sure.
R19OG1B6TZG7TS,was i disappointed at this discovery?

R2JV3PY54F16L9,the cloaks a bit big but when arent they!
R2JV3PY54F16L9,"just a quick warning, he has an action function where he swings his lightsaber."
R2JV3PY54F16L9,"i dont think thats mentioned in the description and if your like me, and like basic figures for display, its kinda a let down."
R2JV3PY54F16L9,"but other than that, i was extremely satisfied."
R3F326HHNPFRWG,a little smaller than i wouldve liked.

R16FMV7US4KR2D,we bought this for our 24 month old grandson.
R16FMV7US4KR2D,"he loves bouncing on it and then ""falling"" off onto the floor."
R16FMV7US4KR2D,"i bought it after watching him play with one at an indoor ""jump"" facility."
R16FMV7US4KR2D,"i figured that if it was durable enough to withstand hundreds of kids bouncing on it day after day, it would hold up well for home use."
R16FMV7US4KR2D,it is made of a very thick rubbertype product.
R16FMV7US4KR2D,"youll need a bicycle or hand pump to air it up, but once aired up, it seems to maintain its air."
R16FMV7US4KR2D,"the fill valve is at the rear of the horse and sits fairly flush with the horse, but even still, while at the indoor jump facility i observed a toddler open the valve with his teeth and deflate one, all in a matter of seconds."

R38MTIDTBP2MJG,"the one i received, which at the time i dont think was pictured at all, is now the primary picture on this listing... im not sure if its supposed to be a bulldog or what, but its absolutely unforgiveably ugly."
R38MTIDTBP2MJG,"i thought id be happy with any of the options that were pictured, but i ended up sending it back... it was almost impossible to even tell what species of animal it was supposed to be."
R38MTIDTBP2MJG,"most of these banks are incredibly cute, but this one is really, really not."
R38MTIDTBP2MJG,"the listing wasnt real representative at the time, but it looks like theyve fixed it up now, so take a good look at that weird ugly mug because thats what youll be getting."

RRRECJ66WAVSN,my little girls loves this & it is very cute!
RRRECJ66WAVSN,"the only reason i would rate it 3 stars is because the top where the square part of the castle is, is so heavy it keep toppling over side ways causing the bottom right corner to lift."
RRRECJ66WAVSN,i have to put a heavy object on the corner to keep it sturdy.
RRRECJ66WAVSN,"other than that, we have thoroughly enjoyed it!"

RLCELNL1ZWM2M,his caregiver said that the next day he picked it up and started playing with it.
RLCELNL1ZWM2M,now he likes it and it seems to calm him.

R3C0SE74AYBSOL,many of the dolls for the youngest kids are only half this size.
R3C0SE74AYBSOL,"it might be okay when they are young, but it doesnt grow with them."
R3C0SE74AYBSOL,this one is nice because it grows with them.
R3C0SE74AYBSOL,it is very cute.
R3C0SE74AYBSOL,it looks like a little baby and has a pacifier.

R11V21FLHJ6PDC,this trike is very sturdy and stylish.
R11V21FLHJ6PDC,i love this pink and black match.
R11V21FLHJ6PDC,i had bought radio flyer trike last week but i returned it because it does not have a foot rest.
R11V21FLHJ6PDC,my little girl is 16 months old and she is taller than her age but she could not reach her feet at the pedal so she needed the foot rest.
R11V21FLHJ6PDC,"actually, radio flyer had better handling than little tikes."
R11V21FLHJ6PDC,little tikes trike is heavier for me to control.
R11V21FLHJ6PDC,but my daughter is enjoying this trike more comfortable.
R11V21FLHJ6PDC,she would not get off of the trike because of discomfort that she had when she was riding the one without the foot rest.

RD450S1X5A7BG,"okay i know i know supply and demand, but when you can get these in retail outlets and other places online for under $10 a piece $16 seems pretty excessive.that being said the figures themselves are nice, and look great on my desktop."
RD450S1X5A7BG,"just remember to shop smart, i was able to get 4 different fallout characters for $30, here it would have cost $64, pretty big difference."

R2Q23D1KFG60GT,just like described.
R2F3TRPA19QS74,buying this physical box is a complete waste of money.
R2F3TRPA19QS74,it is a big box filled with literally not metaphorically useless bits of cardboard and a sheet with some toy code.
R2F3TRPA19QS74,"the hello world example on the website is more complicated than the first few examples in the sheet.while the website or subscriptions to code examples may be useful, i suspect that anyone buying this will feel ripped off as i do."
R2F3TRPA19QS74,"check out the website, which is neat, but dont buy this box hoping for anything more than what you see there."

R3PCH2PB6BXPCI,this will keep you sane.
R3PUSZ7RXQ47WS,dr. beck bailey is wonderful.
R3PUSZ7RXQ47WS,i have used these books in the classroom.

R34BJKONNFBKE8,we bought a second to be able to rotate through while we wash it and might even buy a third as they get pretty gross from her chewing on them

R11YZ3JMM8SKOM,"i will first start this by saying, this is not our first loom bracelet kit but, i do believe it will be our last."
R11YZ3JMM8SKOM,the loom itself is very very sturdy.
R11YZ3JMM8SKOM,each peg has two pegs within it which i must say is much easier to work with than more traditional looms and you can get the hook in with less of a hassle.
R11YZ3JMM8SKOM,i think the set up of the loom allows for you to do more difficult designs without putting too much stress on the loom  weve had a couple looms break for this reason.
R11YZ3JMM8SKOM,"the bands are of great quality as well, i have yet to have one break where as normally i break at least 10 in the process of making one bracelet."
R11YZ3JMM8SKOM,the storage container for the bands sturdy and provides a lot of different compartments so you can organize them however you like.
R11YZ3JMM8SKOM,"the hooks are sturdy plastic, not flimsy or easily bendable."
R11YZ3JMM8SKOM,i absolutely love this kit!
R11YZ3JMM8SKOM,of all the looms kits and bits and pieces you can get for them this by far is the best i have yet to own and i really do not see this breaking for a long time if ever.disclaimer i received this product free for my honest and unbiased opinion and i assure you that is what you have received.

RJFVOXTKE1G1L,this is one of many revell snaptite models that i have...its not a toy and i have said then many times in my reviews...you build it go pew pew and put it away..how a remembered it is like putting together a smaller version of a tie fighter you still have to make the cockpit and all that but the wings do not snap on very well one wing snapped on better then the other but as long as you dont mess with it and play around and act like a fool it will sit on the shelf looking pretty.

R3B0II233FQPKV,this is not the buncho balloons product.
R3B0II233FQPKV,it is shipped from china takes about two weeks and does not work at all.
R3B0II233FQPKV,the package is marked &34magic balloons&34.1.
R3B0II233FQPKV,the filler stems do not fit a hose bib.2.
R3B0II233FQPKV,"if you figure out a fix for 1, most of the balloons do not fill.3."
R3B0II233FQPKV,the balloons that do fill leak at the opening once they fall off the filler stem.this is a totally useless product.

R3FOBJA6VOAOWY,a few of the tattoos did not apply as expected but most of them did.
R3FOBJA6VOAOWY,i was disappointed with the glow factor though.
R3PL4N95S0K7U9,these are colorful and fun.
R3PL4N95S0K7U9,"the magnet isnt very strong, but they do stay up on my fridge."
R3PL4N95S0K7U9,"the paint isnt perfect either, but if you get them for just a couple dollars i would definitely recommend these cute letter monsters!"
R1D7LD51S1PTVW,"bought this for my under one year old nephew, so he could be pulled down the aisle during my wedding."
R1D7LD51S1PTVW,i hate plastic stuff so i bought the metal.
R1D7LD51S1PTVW,"we changed the back board to the other end, we had to drill some holes but it was easy enough."
R1D7LD51S1PTVW,"we used the other holes to hang a ring bearer sign off the end, worked out perfectly."
R1D7LD51S1PTVW,we had to place some pillows around my nephew to help keep him up.
R1D7LD51S1PTVW,"the wagon has only been used in the wedding and decided to keep in good condition, because i want to use it for some pictures here in the future."
R1D7LD51S1PTVW,very happy with the wagon and was easy to be pulled.
R2FKLV2JLGDGTH,ok the 500mah seems to last longer then the 650 they tend to swell up dont know why.
RUOTMHJCNGD5S,"i was really excited for this play mat but when i looked closer i noticed that her name is spelled wrong, luckily i noticed and was able to process a refund and got a different play mat instead, but to everyone out there looking a this do not buy it unless you want asunas name to be spelled wrong."
RRRZWS5WTLTO8,i ordered 4 of these for my grandkids for christmas gifts since i got a good deal on them .. they all love to do these bracelet making stuff... and they go through tons of these bands and they love trading colors so with all these colors they have plenty to trade and plenty to keep and then with all the charms and and even having the extra hooks i think it is great i have bought plenty of bands over the past year and this should keep them busy for a good while ... and then i will be looking again for another good deal... and i am sure i will come across one...
R30BF026YQFZ4C,"grandson loves playing with this, however he does like throwing it in the floor so it would be nice to have a strap so you could adhere it to the walker or high chair if hes not using it on the floor."
R1YJC0EA7O1MY7,lots of fun
R1ADO9NK8YCMBV,son loved it!
R2DD4VWLAUG069,good
R3B1XPG2C692FT,this was one of my husbands contributions to our registry.
R3B1XPG2C692FT,hes a scientist and really likes these.
R3B1XPG2C692FT,"one bummer... since the cubes are 6 sided obviously you cant make an actual periodic table unless you order multiple packs of the blocks, i suppose.baby likes these too."
R3B1XPG2C692FT,good for teething on and making towers to tumble.
R3CZK0QU1X59VZ,"bought for my son to keep in his backpack for school, one to keep in the car and one for home."
R3CZK0QU1X59VZ,worked out good and he loves them.
R31KXGFO2LBXAR,crayola is still good quality stuff.
R29IPTSBCZYKKM,the product was alright...completely see through tho...they might wanna disclose that to future people
RN2WUL2HZ08JL,we are currently working on letter sounds and recognition with our four year old and the leapfrog word whammer go along perfectly with that.
RN2WUL2HZ08JL,"i feel its very reasonably priced, has been very durable and proven to be tons of fun."
RN2WUL2HZ08JL,i even find my 8 year old playing on it as well!
RN2WUL2HZ08JL,highly recommended for preschoolers that are learning to read.i was sent this product in exchange for a honest review.
RN2WUL2HZ08JL,the opinions above are my own.
R301NFJG16WLID,"for the price, it was very good."
R301NFJG16WLID,the only complaint i have is that i received nine pieces instead of ten.
R1WJ5A1NDCY2WI,"showed up with 16 napkins, 8 hats and 6 cups."
R1WJ5A1NDCY2WI,definitely not the 16 pack described.
R26DLJJI95QLA8,fulfilled my expectations.
R26DLJJI95QLA8,100 recomended
R3JCYY85OY1MKD,perfect size and design for 35 year old
R2RKJVJRAVSCWR,"the item was described as new but the item was opened and the cards, money, etc were not in bags and all over the box."
RDUZQLPJMV3QT,fun family game.
RDUZQLPJMV3QT,love it because even my 9yr old and 5 yr old who cant read yet can play together

R2CP0IFGFDBXRC,perfect for my little brothers bday party
R2ZASEKHH2HLW,this was a gift for a 7 year old boy and he was so excited.
R2ZASEKHH2HLW,"suddenly, the family smelled burning rubber followed followed by smoke."
R2ZASEKHH2HLW,this was very traumatic for the little guy.
R2ZASEKHH2HLW,really no stars but had to to post one so as to record this review.
R2FXG4ZKC9ASF3,i was given this doll for my daughter as part of a promotional campaign.
R2FXG4ZKC9ASF3,"the packaging of the product was secure, but not so secure that you needed a pair of scissors to open it."
R2FXG4ZKC9ASF3,my daughter loved the doll and loved the small cat it came with.
R2FXG4ZKC9ASF3,my only criticism is that the hat would not stay snugly on her head.
R2FXG4ZKC9ASF3,otherwise its a nice doll and well made.
R34O9PXXI9I6A4,got this to play while camping with hubby.
R34O9PXXI9I6A4,"he loves the fact that the letters stay put when one turns the board for the next person to read.turns very easily by the way.the negative on this is ........its so darn big on the &34ends&34, that one has to move their letter rack way out of the way to turn the board."
R34O9PXXI9I6A4,kinda bulky in other words.
R3H5FAO0OVH7PO,marvel mashems squishy toys mystery 6packi first want to say that i went through and read some of the other comments on this and a few said that they think that this is way over priced for what you get.
R3H5FAO0OVH7PO,which honestly it is not because if you were to do up to your local store and check out the pricing on these they run about $4 a piece.
R3H5FAO0OVH7PO,"and second to the ones saying they are disappointed about getting the same characters that is just something you take a chance with when buying these and what makes them really fun always trying to get the ones that you dont have.i honestly love this bundle because you do get 6 packs and yes a chance of getting the same ones but its always fun for the kids opening them seeing which character they have gotten this time.also these are great not only for them to play with because they are squishy and bouncy, but they are also nice for collecting."
R3H5FAO0OVH7PO,my kids love getting different mystery packs and keeping them put up in their little cases.i received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
R3VKE2IXA36OA0,"talk about grippy, sand,clay, grass and even wood."
R3VKE2IXA36OA0,but if you want to keep the knobbies wouldnt use em on pavement or concrete.
R3GFPHTDRL6BIE,sand was dryer and doesnt set as well as others.
RP52YHBTG2VAA,it didnt come with anchors and the water didnt go all the way to the end.
R4JDSJ5K62D3Y,my four year old loved decorating her mirror!
R4JDSJ5K62D3Y,very cute.
R1HXCRY7AQ9Z6S,excellent puzzle.
R1HXCRY7AQ9Z6S,"i enjoyed working on it, i hope you will get more of nene thomas puzzles."

R9DBQWMYU4KBK,perfect.
RXW4E6IIWOXPV,perfect
R1TCH25NRGQJ1S,just ok. my kids got bored with this after a few months.
R1TCH25NRGQJ1S,the parts dont stay on to well.
R37HSNY0TPV71J,i have not open it yet because this is a gift for my niece.
R37HSNY0TPV71J,i really think she will love it and i can give a further review on the quality once she receives it.
R2MVOPQYXF5S7N,not necessary but nice to have if your kids use a turn table or switch tracks in their track configurations.
R2MVOPQYXF5S7N,allows the kids to complete loops coming off the turntable that might not otherwise hook up without these.
R2MVOPQYXF5S7N,saves some frustration.
RO4SKMRODRNP1,granddaughter loved this!
R1VXO80YLJNMT5,"the dolls worked great, great product, great price.."
R353D93B8ET02G,buyer beware!
R353D93B8ET02G,the item i received was a stuffed elmo.
R353D93B8ET02G,"however, it is not made by ""gund"" as described in the item description."
R353D93B8ET02G,i do not wish to waste money returning it and will donate to charity.
R35HTXR3ZLZFX2,a okay
RAOSANHFXLP2M,funeducational gift
R32E6JM340Q4WW,these are much smaller than i anticipated and made rather cheaply.
R19JT53LFFBU7F,good
R256O0600ATADL,classic!
R1VVEEJ0BPHJPW,great
RZ4XGJPY64SB9,"this is a fun little magnifier, use it to see how horrid your nails look, or to examine a bug in minute detail, or for its intended purpose as a currency inspector."
RZ4XGJPY64SB9,"worth the meager 3 dollar price tag, but it takes a good two weeks to ship as it comes from china."
R2X61XD4MGPVW0,my daughter loves these!
R2X61XD4MGPVW0,hard to find locally and we live in a hockey town.
R2X61XD4MGPVW0,great price on the black version!
R2X61XD4MGPVW0,quite stable for rolling around the ice arena before practice and games.
RL4O6816NSVSD,another great modelmodel not a toy....but this one is a bit more sturdy then the tie fighters...but still wouldnt play with it it was fun to build and go pew pew a few times but then went up on the shelf with the rest of my star wars models.
R2CTPJHF6NZKNK,perfect condition.
R2X87LWIYBTCCH,ok
R2FCLC4PMNCFV7,cute  very small.

R1DZQJ2L8OL3MO,this is a great product!
R1DZQJ2L8OL3MO,great for handprints.
R1DZQJ2L8OL3MO,"it stays moist if kept in the sealed container, but becomes hard if you leave it out."
RJIT1N02HCCQK,over the last few years ive bought 3 of these nooks.
RJIT1N02HCCQK,they are a lot of fun and easy to fly.
RJIT1N02HCCQK,you will wear it out having fun with it before it breaks.
RJIT1N02HCCQK,this is one of the top three low cost minis that syma makes....in my humble opinion.
RJIT1N02HCCQK,"only advise is really watch out for how much you pay, if youre not careful you could be buying from a seller that charges double the price."
R1H19X8J5OA3IQ,i bought this treasure chest for my 4 year old grandson to play with at the pool.
R1H19X8J5OA3IQ,he likes putting the coins in the chest but the plastic coins that come with it are great for children to use at the pool to dive after.
R7AWMGES6DYYR,great piece.
R7AWMGES6DYYR,fun to assemble.
R7AWMGES6DYYR,looks awesome with my collection.
R1MEFDF4CZTKUV,only wish the floor side was a little bit deeper.
R1MEFDF4CZTKUV,"this shape is great because you can turn it on the side with the opening on top and make it a game to toss the balls, which will inevitably be tossed out, back into the tent."
R1MEFDF4CZTKUV,its neat that it folds up into a small flat to put away.
R1MEFDF4CZTKUV,i ordered 200 balls which is about all it can hold without spilling out.
R1MEFDF4CZTKUV,i bought a mesh drawstring laundry bag at dollar store to store the balls.. hang in closet or where ever.
R1MEFDF4CZTKUV,my 212 yr old granddaughter loves this ball pittent combo.
RO3W8AL5C4TOO,"i""m very pleased with the item."
RO3W8AL5C4TOO,it looks nice in my car.

R1KXZBQO5THKNX,she seemed happy with it.
R1KXZBQO5THKNX,my daughter was eager to get this for her friend after seeing the advertisements on television.
RNQJ1TLQ8HN0V,one of the best party games ive ever played.
RNQJ1TLQ8HN0V,each game is so different and relies on different strategies to complete based on reads of the other players.
RNQJ1TLQ8HN0V,"it takes a little bit of time to play, particularly if you have a lot of seasoned veterans, but is simple enough to pick up as a newbie in a very short period of time.an absolute must for any tabletop gamer!"
R38O4WS1PJL2JO,fun cute little dolls.
R1L0WN7VNRIPJY,the definitive saber figurine!
R1L0WN7VNRIPJY,"highly detailed, accurate, very sturdy, a unique battlescarred base, and it all fits together perfectly."
R1L0WN7VNRIPJY,i couldnt recommend this highly enough to those looking for saber figurines.
R17KRE3TAHAHCH,i didnt read the description well enough.
R17KRE3TAHAHCH,i thought this was a play set.
R17KRE3TAHAHCH,its just a storage container.
R17KRE3TAHAHCH,a lot of money for a tin box and two shopkins.
RTR7BWL8UIKML,"i ordered this helicopter because i love the lights and when i got it, it didnt have one under the nose!"
RTR7BWL8UIKML,now this was the first one i ordered and sent it back.
RTR7BWL8UIKML,went to another sealer and they told me that had what i was looking for and they too send me the wrong one!
RTR7BWL8UIKML,!

R1RTBPDNXO53PZ,bookbag was super cute!
R1RTBPDNXO53PZ,my daughter loved it.
R1RTBPDNXO53PZ,after 2 weeks of school...the bottom literally fell out.
R1RTBPDNXO53PZ,my daughter is only in 3rd grade so she wasnt carrying a large amount of books.
R1RTBPDNXO53PZ,so 2 weeks in to the school year im purchasing another bookbag.
R36OXHCX6G1MPV,everything was fine!

R38IYSM4HMDZGG,this is a great set!
R38IYSM4HMDZGG,my 7 year old was very happy!
R392S80KFW47ZT,"i really want to give this set 5 stars, only because i love the skull shores ghouls so much."
R392S80KFW47ZT,the package i received was a disaster.
R392S80KFW47ZT,"the box itself was damaged, and every single doll except for ghoulia had problems."
R392S80KFW47ZT,"cleo and frankie had the greasiest, stickiest, glue hair i have ever seen in mh dolls."
R392S80KFW47ZT,it took a lot of elbow grease and tlc to fix their hair.
R392S80KFW47ZT,"clawdeen also had greasy hair which i had to fix, and several black smears on her face and neck which i had to remove with acetone."
R392S80KFW47ZT,"draculauras hair was also a mess, but nothing that a wash and restyle couldnt fix."
R392S80KFW47ZT,"in the end, i ended up with a great set of dolls, but it took a lot of work to get there."
R392S80KFW47ZT,"not sure if this is an issue across the board with this particular set, or if i was just the unlucky receiver of this particular box."
ROSUJIY26JXH3,works as describe.
ROSUJIY26JXH3,makes spaghetti like hair growing from the minion.
ROSUJIY26JXH3,my son loves it.

R2VAERJT9UG4Q7,great for the price
R2JFFVNUQIFY7J,my son loves closing these hes just learning how they open.
R2JFFVNUQIFY7J,"the toy is very solid and stands up to his using his feet on it, standing on it, throwing it around, etc."
R2JFFVNUQIFY7J,i dont know how long hell continue to play with it but for now it gets a lot of attention from my 1 year old.
RVB5H25407L2I,"arrived before estimated delivery date, just as advertised."
R29IJ7JGUXYZ30,"amazing cube, if you have mastered the 4x4 you need this."
R2DFQUAPK69Y1F,great item at a great price and fast shipping!

R8GDXLI18H1NG,happy customer.
R8GDXLI18H1NG,jm
R1QN5E2PKCU9BU,these are not 1000mah!
R1QN5E2PKCU9BU,i compared the size to my 850 mah battery and it is the same physical size.
R1QN5E2PKCU9BU,i cycled it and only got 800mah out of it.
RH87YAJK7GAGG,the puzzle pieces were not precisely cut and several had the picture lifting on the edges.i ordered this as a gift for a relative that loves barns.
RH87YAJK7GAGG,i will order only ravensburger puzzles in the future.
R12Z7T8XU2WX5P,these were perfect for the phantom 2 and worked very well.
RQ2N7IEPVO5Y,looks like it should cost $200.
RQ2N7IEPVO5Y,"nice wood, and the magnetic latch holds tight."
R2JBMX79UACWTQ,the yellow hoe broke with in the 1st 12 hrs of my kids using it.
R2JBMX79UACWTQ,and the red rake bends and will be the next thing broken.
R2JBMX79UACWTQ,my kids loved them but got so disapointed when everything started to break.
R2JBMX79UACWTQ,i would not buy if you have kids that like to dig and will put it go good use.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,pure junk!
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,the canvas is made up with lines not the drawn ones that are hard to paint over they are like stitched lines in the plastic fabric.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,so it leaves a jagged streak under the paint making small areas and corners hard to get a straight edge.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,it also comes with tiny tiny paint pot supplies so you will need to go to a craft store to get more before you paint.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,i started painting and the paint included has a thicker and glossy shine.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,the cloth canvas comes through so even with thick paint you need to go over it a few times.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,"the paint i used from home, as close to the color that came most of all the black is very lackluster compared to the paint it came in."
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,the canvas is very hard to read and there is lettering at the bottom right hand side making it look tacky see photo the brushes are actually great and it came with a free sticker.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,but it basically was a cheap made in china dollar store style set.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,the writingspelling on the box is wrong... if you buy this please do yourself a major solid and buy paint from a craft store prior.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,stick to one style paint so you wont get the flat to lackluster mess mix i created tonight.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,its not letting my upload my photo.
R24FEXJQO1C4V7,"but yes, there is lettering on the end crease where people will see after you are done painting."
R1Q6PELKWLOMKC,great
RLU4D227OK1LV,they were very small and cheaply made.
RLU4D227OK1LV,im pretty sure not even one pair made it out of the party still together.
RLU4D227OK1LV,"i didnt expect much, but was still entirely disappointed."
R3ECX5HNH9DX4K,good

R1PS2DWVCGAHW9,my son loves it!
R1PS2DWVCGAHW9,so far so good!
R19M8T8F4FPXVB,its a great costume for my kid.
R19M8T8F4FPXVB,flimsy as are all the other ones like this.
R19M8T8F4FPXVB,i ordered a little large to allow for a jacket to fit under and it will.
R19M8T8F4FPXVB,if i get a good halloween out of it and a few weeks of play afterwards ill be happy with it.
R3SKK6NJHXHX9,"a very fun and simplistic game for four players.when explaining the game, it often comes off as daunting to newer players particularly inexperienced tabletop gamers, but playing through a quick few rounds is often more than sufficient enough to fully acclimate someone into the game experience."
R2ISB6ZQ73KACH,so cute and fit great!!!
R2ISB6ZQ73KACH,our cat is always stealing my daughters barbie shoes... definitely will be ordering more!
R3O4M1SAZEAUQS,very cool gift!!

R1IO3VKPLZJ9SK,cute stuff
RWKY9SNWE06A7,the price is very nice.
RWKY9SNWE06A7,it definitely need a fill water tool to fill water.
RWKY9SNWE06A7,we tried to fill water on tap.
RWKY9SNWE06A7,it is hard to open the mouth big or it was broken.
R1WWDKFG8RUK5V,kids love it.
R5RSV348BHXF1,"i did not receive a case i only received 6 boxes, so i was very disappointed."
R5RSV348BHXF1,had some problems getting a credit for the remainder of the boxes.
RJDPAO8PNIRWI,great to play with the glider castle.
RJDPAO8PNIRWI,they role well down the ramps

R20HF393MHH8AA,very high quality at a reasonable price
RW5SBJCBWMCZ1,handy for storing paper with the markers.
RW5SBJCBWMCZ1,agree with other buyers that the markets are a little difficult to snap inget out for a 4.5 year old.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,i had a chance to try out this product as a bzzagent to give a review.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,it was fun and easy.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,my 6 years old daughter could do it all by herself and was very excited to do it and of course eat chocolate.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,setup and process was not complicated at all.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,the most thing i like is melting the tray.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,just put hot water in the melting tray not too hot.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,i heated one cup of water in the microwave for a min.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,chocolate melted within 5 min.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,and just put chocolate into molds and put it in the freezer.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,but dont forget to put oil first because chocolate will stuck in moldsi failed at the first time so kids scooped up with a little spoon.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,but with oil it worked well.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,and the instruction says to put chocolate in the freezer for 15 min.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,but it didnt hardened enough within 15 min.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,at least a few hours would be needed.
R14U6RNRCLW19S,overall it was fun especially my daughter loved it and good to spend time with kids.

R30T7ZAWG1088U,so soft.
R30T7ZAWG1088U,this product made my day
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,i was so excited to get this!
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"i thought it would be great fun, and i couldnt wait to try it!"
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"i wish i could write a more comprehensive review, but all i can do is relate my experience.so heres what happened it arrived, and i immediately opened it up and figured out what i had to do."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"i put the 4 aa batteries into the controller, and plugged in the helicopter to charge."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"a short while later, it was ready to go!even though the instructions said it could be flown indoors, i went outside its a nice day here, no wind."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,the jump jet took off beautifully!
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"it went up in the air, i touched the &34transform&34 button to convert it to airplane mode, and it flew around the yard nicely!"
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"i had a little trouble controlling the altitude, though, and i was about to crash into the garden fence."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"i put it back into helicopter mode, and it went, hmmm, i guess &34a little uncontrolled&34 is the best way to say it."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"anyway, it rose up in the air, because i wanted to get it out of the crash zone fence, basketball hoop, cars, house, etc.. unfortunately, it didnt go straight up, it also went across the yard and near a tall locust tree i swear, i was trying for straight up!."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"it hovered there a bit, maybe ten feet from the tree, about 70 feet up its a big tree."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,so then i tried to move it away from the tree.
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,oops.
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,into the tree it went!
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"and stuck there.i flew it for all of about three minutes, and now it is stuck 60 feet up."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"i tried all the controls to get it free  and while it was still responding to the controls, i could not get it to shake itself free from the tree."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,so now im waiting for some good winds to blow it out of the tree.overall the jump jet was easy to figure out and get started.
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,supereasy!
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,charging and getting started flying was a breeze  five stars for that!
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"as for the flying, well, the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use, but the helicopter mode is a touch unstable."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"granted, im probably not the most talented pilot."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"i refer the reader to my review of the parrot drone, which i crashed, repeatedlyi would love to give this five stars, because it was three minutes of great fun!"
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"but all things considered, ill just go with four stars based on the instability."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"if and when it comes down from the tree hopefully uninjured from wind  rain  the fall ill try it again, and perhaps update my review."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"for now ill just say, try it in a big open area until you get the hang of it."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,i thought my yard was big enough since it is supposedly able to be flown indoors!?!?!??
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"?, but apparently not.good luck!update two and a half months later, this thing is still stuck up in the tree!"
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"we even tried shooting it down with a potato cannon, but we werent accurate enough."
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,my hope for successful and still functional retrieval is waning.
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"we shall see.. i refer the reader to my review of the parrot drone, which i crashed, repeatedly i would love to give this five stars, because it was three minutes of great fun!"
R2GW72NE0GSDX5,"but all things considered, ill just go with four stars based on the instability."

R3FKMFBYRYD5CE,these toys are a must have for any little daniel tiger fan.

R2H3P5YU10M7U0,definitely worth what i paid for them.
R18JRGNOHP6J7Q,these are the absolute best!
R18JRGNOHP6J7Q,i wear a womans 7 to 7.5 and these fit beautifully.
R18JRGNOHP6J7Q,i think if youre more than a size 10 you might have problems fitting into these.
R18JRGNOHP6J7Q,i get so many compliments when wearing them.
R18JRGNOHP6J7Q,i would definitely buy again.
R3I15UKOKDA4DL,bought this for my little sisters birthday after i decided to get back into playing since she is so excited about playing.
R3I15UKOKDA4DL,happy to know that everything in the box was 100 legitimate and not a single item was missing.
R3I15UKOKDA4DL,just know that getting an ex or mega ex is not guarantied in elite trainer boxes.
R3I15UKOKDA4DL,"my sister opened all the packs and the best she got were some holos and reverse holos, while i bought the ancient origins box and got 1 ex  so its a bit obvious she was disappointed."
R3I15UKOKDA4DL,it only raises the chance that you will get one.
R3I15UKOKDA4DL,if you want a guaranty then buy the booster boxes that run you about $100 on amazon and about $150 on pokemons official store site pokemoncenter.com.
R3NBJWW96IQAJL,thank you
R3P1WTK08FY43O,disappointed in the pool as the top ring appears to be defective as it wont hold air.
RSMVI4CNQFOQ,took to universal studios and they work well at both parks for the harry potter interactive areas.
RSMVI4CNQFOQ,these are the same ones you can buy at universal studios.
R11ZBUIQ07I13F,be aware this item is just what the girl is wearing on her forearms.
R11ZBUIQ07I13F,"this item does not come with the hoodie or anything else in the picture.ever the badger, i needed a ridiculous costume for halloween."
R11ZBUIQ07I13F,"i am a man, 58&34 and about 145 lbs."
R11ZBUIQ07I13F,they fit me perfect!
R11ZBUIQ07I13F,"dressing up as a brony for halloween, this item put the finishing touches and an amazing costume as rainbow dash."
R11ZBUIQ07I13F,would pony up again.
R11ZBUIQ07I13F,1010.
R3M657S2FHM3IB,thank you
R2CVR13T8IT44K,this wouldnt have been my first choice for a pinata but my son picked a difficult birthday theme and this was the only way to get a matching pinata.
R2CVR13T8IT44K,"it was sturdy, held a lot of treats, and was easy to fill."
R2CVR13T8IT44K,i gave it a 4 only because tapingglueing on a cup up balloon doesnt look as nice as getting a pinata that is already made to match the theme.
R2XEW6N7TNO5AU,nice size.
R2XEW6N7TNO5AU,stayed inflated for over a week
R2H1O93QHAZ3IB,my 4 yr old son loved them.the only thing is that they are really slimy and once the water dries out they go back to the original size but its fun waiting for them to hatch.
R2K995CKSKHFEB,better than what was expected.
R2K995CKSKHFEB,i got a ton of laughs with it!
R7Z5TWCZ75A6Z,i think i could buy authentic major league baseballs for less than this!
R7Z5TWCZ75A6Z,way too expensive

R22OB94YJ90519,"makes me happy, too."
RREL26SPHA96Y,cute.
RREL26SPHA96Y,my daughter and the neighbor both loved their ostrich pets.my only comment and the reason for only 3 stars was how much of the feather material seems to slowly drop off and away from these as they are played with.
RREL26SPHA96Y,"not an extreme amount, but you can tell each time the kids have taken these out."
RBOGJIHVQT1VP,not good quality

R1JVNANPAHDEAS,this is such a fun toy.
R1JVNANPAHDEAS,keeps my 2 year old very busy.
R2ET3Q1AFC9YCP,we bought this floatie for our 4 month old when for when we go to fl in a couple months.
R2ET3Q1AFC9YCP,at 4 months she is too small for it 13 lbs.
R2ET3Q1AFC9YCP,"i wanted to give a size comparison, since i have seen some people say their 4 month old does just fine with it."
R2ET3Q1AFC9YCP,"i also know per the manufacturers guidelines, she is supposed to be too small, but i wanted to try it out for fun anyway!"
R2ET3Q1AFC9YCP,"she is too small for it because when we put her in, the water comes up too high on her chest and she cant fully support herself yet, so i have to hold her up."
R2ET3Q1AFC9YCP,i gave it 4 stars because the octopus attachment is hard to keep inflated while you are trying to plug in the stopper.
R2ET3Q1AFC9YCP,for some reason the air escapes very quickly from it.
R2ET3Q1AFC9YCP,"well we have not been able to use it much, i do have high hopes for the product."
R1WIERXXZA6CND,"the stars are amazing and light up as needed, of course you need to add light to it in order for them to glow."
R1WIERXXZA6CND,"the sticker to past them included is not great, i would buy putty without a doubt if you want them to really stick."
R1WIERXXZA6CND,"with putty, they even stick to popcorn sealings!"
R2HZL1GBAMU0WV,thanks
R3CEZMFN643596,the idea is great.

R3PV3HRLK6KL3P,cute costume.
R3PV3HRLK6KL3P,my 7 year old daughter is looking forward to wearing it for halloween.
R3PV3HRLK6KL3P,my daughter is about 47 inches tall and 44 pounds and typically wears a size 7 in clothes with a long torsoshort legsaverage build.
R3PV3HRLK6KL3P,"unfortunately the halloween costume sizing is a little strange since the size choices are generally a small size 46 or medium size 810. i picked the medium realizing it would likely be too big, but figured too big is better than too small."
R3PV3HRLK6KL3P,"when it arrived, it was about 2 inches too long in the arms and 4 inches in the legs."
R3PV3HRLK6KL3P,but i had no trouble adding a quick hem to shorten them.
R3PV3HRLK6KL3P,"it isnt fitted like leggings for her, but thats okay for us."
R3PV3HRLK6KL3P,"surprisingly, i had to cut the elastic waist in a few places so that it wasnt too tight around my daughters waist, but it was an easy fix."
R3PV3HRLK6KL3P,"with a few minutes of working on it, it fits her great and shes ready for trick or treating!"

R3SVC1TVZWJE2J,"although i dont have any experience with magic, i do have extensive experience with heroscape  hasbros now discontinued game that has been reborn as this game.for the most part the game is similar to heroscape  the modular 3d terrain for instance is identical to the pieces provided with the prior game."
R3SVC1TVZWJE2J,"one major difference though is that while the entire board in heroscape was created with modular 3d tile, in planeswalkers the majority of the board is a flat, cardboard hex map with a handful of the 3d pieces added for elevation purposes."
R3SVC1TVZWJE2J,"while not as impressive as the original game, the setuptakedown of the new game is vastly better.planeswalkers also uses leaders and a hand of cards to enhance gameplay that differ from heroscape."
R3SVC1TVZWJE2J,"in general, i like both of these additions, though they dont give as much flexibility in playing combinations of heroes as the original game this may come with expansion in the future though.the flow of the games is very comparable  move, use abilities, attack if within range."
R3SVC1TVZWJE2J,movement and lineofsight between elevations is also very similar.in my plays so far it has been a fairly quick play  less than 30 minutes in a 2player game.
R3SVC1TVZWJE2J,combined with the quick setup it makes this a good filler type game.
R3SVC1TVZWJE2J,"i suspect it could slow down substantially with multiple players, though there is a very real danger of players ganging up on another and taking them out very quickly.the only other missing component from heroscape is that the miniatures were fully painted in that game  perhaps that is why that line was discontinued!i cant comment on the connection to magic the gathering  the inclusion of the hand of cards is certainly from that game and i assume that the heroes and other characters are directly out of that game also.overall, this game is just ok. not the worst, but not the most interesting either."
R262UFPGWE6L5B,its a good card for a defenderwall deck
R5C0TG88QV4AY,battery was not oe type.
R5C0TG88QV4AY,i returned it and at this point am not sure i even got my refund.

R27CUIX5BMLMT1,do not waste your money!!!
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,"i received mine in the mail, charged the batteries, took it out for a spin."
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,the quadcopter does fly great and is very easy to operate.
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,i bought this copter because i wanted to shoot cool videos with it.
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,the first time i tried to shoot a video i removed the sd card and plugged it into my computer.
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,i found that the sd was corrupt and had nothing on it.
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,"i used another sd card that i knew worked because i used it with my gopro, this sd also was corrupt."
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,i returned the copter.
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,the next one i got i started flying and tried taking video right away.
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,i was able to shoot video and uploaded them onto my phone from the sd card.
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,a week later i tried to view the videos and the sd card was corrupt.
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,i tried to load them on my computer and the sd card was blank.
R27CUIX5BMLMT1,this product is junk!
R1VD0R1VQP4CCR,love it
R3KJJ3SU5C18XB,such a cute lego set.
R3KJJ3SU5C18XB,my boys love it and it was easy to put together.
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,this ufo is an enjoyable remote controlled toy!
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,it comes with a detailed set of instructions that make it clear to prepare the toy and use it for the first time or repeated usage if you forget something!.
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,"it comes precharged, but you will have to place two double a batteries in the remote these are not included with the toy."
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,the screwdriver that comes with the instructions is handy for removing the screw that holds the battery cover in place.
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,"the charging cable is also easy to useinstall as needed, but again because it is precharged you wont need this right away."
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,the remote is easy to use and offers a variety of speed settings based on your pull  allowing for hovering mode or for you to send it soaring!
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,it is easy to operate and has a great range so you dont have to be right next to itunderneath it.
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,"it also appears to be very durable im not very good at landing so it hit the ground quite a few times, rather hard, and you could not see any damage on it."
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,this would make a great birthday or christmas gift for a child or an adult!
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,its fun for all ages!
R1E8RTI2BRNKEM,i received this product as a sample from the seller in exchange for my honest evaluation and review.
R2DVQ823UFHSEO,i ordered this as a test of whether or not id like the revoltech mini style.
R2DVQ823UFHSEO,and i do.
R2DVQ823UFHSEO,"the joints dont ratchet like the larger revoltech series, so kinnikuman can be moved smoothly from one pose to another as he battles his way to intergalactic wrestling superiority and all the gyudon he can eat!"
R39GJDGMZGXQIB,these were easter egg surprises in lieu of candy.

R1EHMATTXDHUJR,this is the favorite leaptv game so far!
R1EHMATTXDHUJR,my kids have absolutely loved creating their own world and working together to create a magical place.
R1EHMATTXDHUJR,i love that again the difficulty of the learning material adjusts depending on which user profile is being used.
R1EHMATTXDHUJR,"also, it is a good step to make the kids get out of the animated world of movies that they are used to and allow them to create their own."
RKZ2ZOQ2ADR80,great figure.
RKZ2ZOQ2ADR80,"all the poses are appropriate for the character, and the hand in pocket pose is especially neat."
R38LE2O2JF4A1S,it came with a yellow substance on it.
R38LE2O2JF4A1S,we tried cleaning it off and putting batteries in it.
R38LE2O2JF4A1S,the car worked but the sirens were on all the time.
R38LE2O2JF4A1S,that was really annoying.
R38LE2O2JF4A1S,so we returned the car.
R2U49J8NKI5C1U,please ignore original review.
R2U49J8NKI5C1U,this backpack did not make it past the first week of school before the strap already tore from the bag and the only thing in it was a notebook and empty binder!
R2U49J8NKI5C1U,what a waste!!!!
R2U49J8NKI5C1U,"for all the more i paid for this backpack, this is such a great deal!"
R2U49J8NKI5C1U,bought this for my daughter who is in the 7th grade for school.
R2U49J8NKI5C1U,"we just received it, so cant say much for durability, but it looks pretty sturdy."
R2U49J8NKI5C1U,"you cannot fit a lot of largeheavy books, but it will hold a decent amount."
R2U49J8NKI5C1U,its very cute and nicely made.
R2U49J8NKI5C1U,she loves it.

RCR7OEV663DSK,loved the easy way to fill.
RCR7OEV663DSK,"just remove the top cover, fill with water and you are ready to go."
RCR7OEV663DSK,"great powerful stream of water, great packaging, very easy to use so why didnt i give it 5 stars?"
RCR7OEV663DSK,"well, my gun leaks."
RCR7OEV663DSK,i purchased this to have ready for my cat who is determined to stalk my cardinals and hummingbirds.
RCR7OEV663DSK,"i wanted to leave my loaded gun on the counter for quick use but no matter how i arranged it, it leaked."
RCR7OEV663DSK,i am disappointed because i have it arranged in a large plastic tub by the door to catch the drips.
RCR7OEV663DSK,"wish it didnt leak, otherwise it is a great choice."
R37JLSQRA4JSP6,loses air faster than expected.

R2Y50B1WCPKLUB,this rubber duck tips over when placed in water
R25HGT3FD9NXA2,the lighting is bad as there is something within the game blocking it.
R25HGT3FD9NXA2,there is a large smudge under the screen which cannot be felt or removed.
R25HGT3FD9NXA2,this item appears to be used which was not disclosed.
R25HGT3FD9NXA2,i am not pleased at all with the quality of this game for the exhorbitant price of $229!
R25HGT3FD9NXA2,i missed my first game so much i took a chance.i am very pleased with the two books.
R3OWO4HR0G5XG4,thank you!
R1AI7E0CR1H5IK,i love that the balloons fill up so easily and quickly.i love that i do not have to tie every single one of the water balloons as that gets very boring and i get tired very quick.
R1AI7E0CR1H5IK,"i love that so many come in the kit.i love that the filling wands are very long and flexible.the water balloons provided lots of fun on a friday afternoon for my family.my son has a birthday during summer months ,and i will definitely be using this balloons because they will be totally perfect for my childs summer birthday birthday party.the filing wand easily attached to my water hose without much effort on my part.the water balloons easily detach from the wand.i love balloon monsoon water balloons self tying kit.i have receive this product in exchange of my honest and unbiased review but all opinions are completely my own based on my experience with the product."

RDM072WI8YI4E,cute and quality little toys
R2XBKM458M8B31,very fun and easy to use.
R2XBKM458M8B31,i got this for my 12 year old nephew to use when he visited.
R2XBKM458M8B31,it was fun for the whole family.
R2XBKM458M8B31,on the first launch we were surprised to see how high up in the air the bottle went.
R2XBKM458M8B31,it was fun experimenting with the amount of water and air pressure to use for an optimum launch.
R2XBKM458M8B31,we used clear packaging tape to attach two glow sticks on each side of the liter bottle for night launches.
R1GVBP4IU3B6EC,my 9 year old son was given this for his birthday.
R1GVBP4IU3B6EC,he loves it!
R1GVBP4IU3B6EC,it definitely runs small.
R1GVBP4IU3B6EC,he wears asize 10 normally and we ended up returning that size and got the largest!

R29F8AAMGFKOXK,my seven year old loved this.
R29F8AAMGFKOXK,good assortment
RFA3IF7QSQAJ4,added another level of fun to my sons party.
R48BZPPIEV48K,we received this as a promotion from airhogs and my husband and son spent all weekend playing with this helicopter and truck!
R48BZPPIEV48K,the battery charge last a good while in the copter and after what i estimate to be 15 hours of solid play time i havent replaced them yet.
R48BZPPIEV48K,those of you with kids know nothing is more annoying than having to replace batteries non stop is.
R48BZPPIEV48K,both the car and helicopter where easy to maneuver by my 8yo and he has really gotten to where he can manipulate the copter all over.
R48BZPPIEV48K,"there are two minor things i would change, first is the copter occasionally catches on the hatch doors and goes flying off, second is that a set of replacement blades would be great."
R48BZPPIEV48K,"after pinging of several pieces of furniture and the hatch doors the blades got nicked up, so far it hasnt effected the flying at all but im not sure how much more it will take before it does."
R48BZPPIEV48K,over all a great toy for kids of all ages!
R1FFEOP23KFWCX,i was so disappointed by this order.
R1FFEOP23KFWCX,"i was under the impression that there would be 8 different animals, instead we got 4 of 2 different animals, turtle and crab."
R1FFEOP23KFWCX,we wanted a bunch of different ones and i would have ordered something different had i known!
R3KCOYK2SGOS3,awesome gorilla!bigger and better than expected.
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,this &34play space&34 bar is an ok toy but not a show stopper.
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,"the look of it is great, the sounds are subtle vs. blaring like most kid toys, and its easy to use."
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,"its base is stable with regard to tipping, but it does slide on carpet."
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,my husband said the assembly instructions were terrible and he ended up relying on the picture from the box!
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,it took about 20 minutes total.my 1yo likes to stand against it when doing other things like watching tv or playing with a toy in one hand.
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,i havent seen her engage in the music buttonskeys very much.
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,"in fact, she plays with the roller toys more than the sound part."
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,"the unit appears to have an autooff feature, because we frequently have to turn it off and back on again so it will make sound."
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,good for saving those 4 cbatteries?
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,"not sure, but it is a little frustrating to have to redo it a few times each day especially since the switch isnt in the most convenient location."
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,"as of now, im lukewarm on it."
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,"it looks cool, she likes standing against it, but the playing part has been limited in the 2 weeks weve had it."
R22AAIC2XK8QUC,"if things change and she starts going crazy for it, ill update!"
R40ML4AHW8M6Q,"this is a nice, fun set of balls for toddler aged kids."
R40ML4AHW8M6Q,"i dont really like to play in the house, but these things minimize the damage."
R40ML4AHW8M6Q,"seem to be pretty solidly constructed, i dont foresee them wearing out really quickly."
R40ML4AHW8M6Q,"a lot of fun with the boy, four sports to choose from."

R3MIVZH4KNQE7L,this toy arrived quickly and was well packaged.
R3MIVZH4KNQE7L,"i ordered it to play toss with my 3 yr old grand daughter, and it does improve her ability to catch it."
RG1B5NBETMKC3,broke within 2 weeks.
RPJU2DJTSGT1E,missing 3 parts.
RPJU2DJTSGT1E,waiting for them to arrive.
RPJU2DJTSGT1E,lego ships them and to are at no cost to purchaser.

R2PYWT29WHLFFQ,thank you
R2RNHF163LIJP4,when opened the tunnel was wet and mildewed.
R2RNHF163LIJP4,"bleach soaking removed the mildew but it took hours to soak, rinse and dry."
R2RNHF163LIJP4,i do not believe a childs toy should be packaged in a way that permits contamination not recommended
R30PRRPB6XL6Y5,beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful
R39QB2G7NW3PC,great baloons!
R2UMT5NK9B8X3P,the wheels are plastic.
R2UMT5NK9B8X3P,they are loud when riding on the cement.
R2UMT5NK9B8X3P,you have zero or no control on the front wheel when pushing the bike.
R2UMT5NK9B8X3P,"if you are looking to buy for a child to bike by himself, this is probably ok. but if you are looking to push it around, then i dont recommend."
R2UMT5NK9B8X3P,very frustrating when trying to maneuver the wheel.
R19VPLALY9ULE1,probably worst star wars spaceship we have.
R19VPLALY9ULE1,"my boys love almost everything lego, but this one literally falls apart when you try to open up the sides to play with it so you cant play with it."
R19VPLALY9ULE1,the thing is incredibly fragileflimsy.
R2TXY8C2GWBG8V,"one set of stairs would not fit into holes, but no problem as company sent another second floorwithin a couple of days and the stairs fit perfectly.otherwise the doll house is well built and easy to install."
R2TXY8C2GWBG8V,my 4 year granddaughter loved it.

R18T8SFBDXAKSY,"i used the cover to prevent additional ""help"" after hours."
R18T8SFBDXAKSY,"photo taken prior to our ""off limits"" discussion."
R17Z615FVN9053,the puzzles are made of good quality and arrived in a good time frame
R3V2U1Y1F51DY0,scribble with these pens and find all the hidden surprises!
R3V2U1Y1F51DY0,this is a fun set that teaches discovery and looking for mysteries.
R3V2U1Y1F51DY0,"all melissa and doug toys teach kids something, and this set is no exception."
R3JZ1DE7OV0MRJ,awesome!
R32H8E7XBC0LDG,my daughter loves these!
R32H8E7XBC0LDG,these are awesome quality and can be put in the dishwasher with no worries of them breaking.
R32H8E7XBC0LDG,very strong plastic and i have no concerns of her breaking them.
R32H8E7XBC0LDG,she is able to pour the pitcher without the lid coming off too.
R32H8E7XBC0LDG,"the cups are a perfect size for a childs teaset, about 2inx2in, i am thinking maybe 2.5 in."
R32H8E7XBC0LDG,"i didnt want to get the porcelain ones for fear of her breaking them, so this is ideal for a 5 year old."
R2TU5NULJGYPR7,very fun.
RH2MP2GCZ75WE,in the tool box
R3RTE6M6PXJ0XE,in the tool box
RNT14OM70H7JI,we got these to use as goody bags for my daughters pink paris themed birthday party.
RNT14OM70H7JI,"the pink design was only on one side, the other side was all white which was a bit dissapointing."
RNT14OM70H7JI,"but all in all, very cute and a great price."
R2A878F29QV8IB,my daughter loves it
R3TEDTZBO41WCF,"this game can be fun if you have friends that like to nerd it out and argue over ambiguous definitions of words in the ruleson the cards, but it can be fairly confusing keeping track of which actionsabilities take effect at what time... for example, certain minions ability say if they get ""destroyed"" then something happens, but the rules dont explicitly state what qualifies as ""destroyed"" is it any time they go to the discard pile per another cards action, or when a base scores, is it only when the action explicitly says ""destroy this minion"", or does it also include when they ""go back into the owners hand"" per another action cardminion ability?"
R3TEDTZBO41WCF,"its fun to see how different pairs of decks mesh, but some overpower others, and different combinations of rules make some cards completely useless."
R3TEDTZBO41WCF,"players who havent played smash up before are in for some confusion the first couple rounds, but if youre not in it for competition but just to see what happens, itll work out."
R2BYTT5GPA0OYZ,seems to hold a charge fairly well
R21AKMOAPQP73S,excellent
RZZ9I60PJGZPM,very cute n plushy.
RZZ9I60PJGZPM,must buy for this price

R1XTFBNCGFYL4B,we started her with the colored fish one then the number and the alphabets.
R1XTFBNCGFYL4B,shes 2 now and shes still playing with them.

R1MWR4G9FPHNEY,purchased this for my son last christmas.
R1MWR4G9FPHNEY,he plays with it all the time.
R1MWR4G9FPHNEY,i recommend purchasing extra batteries for it.
R1MWR4G9FPHNEY,i believe the remote and the hexbug take the same battery.
R1MWR4G9FPHNEY,my son is 5 and really enjoys it.
R5OCEGEZPMP5T,my nieces love this book i bought one for each and will be buying more.
R5OCEGEZPMP5T,the story is fantastic and the drawings are so unique.
R5OCEGEZPMP5T,a must for any childs library.
R1TL32XXOGZYAL,hilariously offensive again.
R19Q1U7IZQRO5Y,very cute and comfortable
R1VYC4J882T9S8,i just love it so much!
R39T0LPHWMNUUL,these are expensive but worth the money.
R39T0LPHWMNUUL,"the coffee maker makes ""coffee"" and you can put water in the blender and mixer."
R39T0LPHWMNUUL,they are sturdy and have held up.
R39T0LPHWMNUUL,"the toaster doesnt seem to want to ""toast"" you cant push the lever down anymore, but everything else works perfectly."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,here is a toy that inspires mixed feelings.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"on the one hand, it can be addictive for short periods of time."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"on the other hand, the game is the same thing over and over."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,we played it and liked it.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,winning is a matter of 100 chance.assembly is easy.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,out of the box there are a few parts.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,one portion is the upper tier of a cake.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,pinkie pie is on a post that gets pushed into the lower tier of the cake.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"after pinkie pie is pushed into the upper tier, a lid covers pinkie pie."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"lastly, there are twelve decorations."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,each person inserts a decoration into the cake until pinkie pie pops out.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,the winner is the person who made pinkie pie pop out.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"remove all the decorations, reset pinkie pie, and repeat.on the plus side, this game is fast."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"from start to finish, the game is over in less than a minute."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,i doubt there are many children with an attention span of less than a minute.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,resetting the game is relatively quick as well.
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"if a couple of players are enthusiastic, they can keep track of the number of times each person wins."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"also a plus, pinkie pie is the central character."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"if the game gets to be too boring, leave pinkie pie popped up and keep the cake decorations on, and set the whole thing on a shelf as a decoration."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"whats to lose here?on the down side, the game can get old quickly."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"on the other hand, you play for twenty minutes, get popping pinkie pie out of your system, and move on to another game."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"some people might see the simplicity of the game as a downside, but in the 35 age range, simplicity is generally a good thing."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"however, even older children, all the way to grandparents, can find sufficient enjoyment in this game to make it worth playing for short periods remember, a period is a nonzero duration of time.this game is attractive, easy to play, and fast."
R2J0NND7X5PORJ,"it should be easy to explain to most children in the target age range, and even grandparents should find the game interesting for short periods.enjoy!enjoy!"
R3L377HWPIR2Y8,very cool gift for a special young boy.
R3L377HWPIR2Y8,they get to decorate their own monster trucks!!

R2ARN96N4AU5WD,like that is has its own box to keep all the cards in and not lose any.
R2ARN96N4AU5WD,we had fun and laughed while playing this game.
R2ARN96N4AU5WD,i did receive this card game complimentary for my honest thoughts and unbiased review.
R2WXSGQZKQ3D0S,"only 10 to 15 mins of power, still better than the original battery the car came with 58mins."
RB8FS3W77LYZ9,"i purchased all 3 of the aurora world dreamy eyes dinosaurs for my 1yearold son, but i ended up returning them for a different set that was machine washable."
RB8FS3W77LYZ9,"that said, these guys were terrificreally vibrant colors, soft and cuddly, and really adorable."
RB8FS3W77LYZ9,these were a great size for a baby or toddler.
RB8FS3W77LYZ9,"recently my other kid has messed up some unwashable stuffed animals by throwing up on them, so i have recent motivation for buying machine washable toys."
R66UHZRG1B4IG,love it

R3TIXZ1YFZL979,really good singleplayer card drafting game.
R3TIXZ1YFZL979,"has a bit of a lengthy setup phase, but the game plays really well over and over and has a pretty deep strategy with the deckdrafting phase at the start of the game."
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,these bags were perfect for what i needed them for.
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,the are true to size and as advertised.
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,i used them as favor bags for a childs birthday party.
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,"i filled them with a snack a juice and small bag of chips, toys, and candy fruit snacks and others."
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,the bag was very roomy and seemed to be of decent quality.
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,the kids have reused and carry around their toys in them.
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,"they fill them with action figures, cans of play dough, legos, and more."
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,it is a nice bag to allow them to fill when traveling or playing over someone.
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,they are not tempted to bring large toys and love carrying around the colorful bag.
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,the colors are as described.
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,the only complaint i could say are that some arrived wrinkled.
R3JDV4AIY6PX4S,"i am guessing i could have steamed the wrinkles out, but i did not give that a try."
R2ZIG9XZ25AZ7Y,bought more for as a display item since finding an actual one either fell apart at the slightest movement or cost more than $300.
R2ZIG9XZ25AZ7Y,however playing yahtzee with this is pretty cool to and fun with my kids.
R2ZIG9XZ25AZ7Y,still use it as a display but it gets played with once a week.

R2SB2HFS8L5AEJ,super cute!
R2SB2HFS8L5AEJ,i bought them to go with the bus
R3B93SOVLY9ORH,the costume was very good quality.
R3B93SOVLY9ORH,pants are a bit long but outfit a big hit.
R3JLHE86N463LG,"this is quite possibly the worse train set ever designed.due to the way the carts connect to each other, it is completely impossible for the train to go up and down the &34slope&34 without completely falling apart.also the train engine is a little too large for the curve section of the track.if you love your children, do not buy this."
R1M1MUBGXT40IF,this was a huge hit with my child.
R1M1MUBGXT40IF,"the item was shipped quickly, received in perfeect condition."
R1M1MUBGXT40IF,"the block of sand that the ""bones"" are hidden inside can get messy when being excavated...so i recommend putting down newspaper or some other type of barrier we put ours inside a larger cardboard box for easier cleanup."
R1M1MUBGXT40IF,"this was so much fun for me and my child, that we purchased other smithsonian kits."
RV3FPCNQ2RIEL,"i mean, its a giant flip flop you guys."
RV3FPCNQ2RIEL,its exactly what i was expecting.
RV3FPCNQ2RIEL,"its pretty large which is perfect, and the construction seems solid."
RV3FPCNQ2RIEL,"after two full days of use and abuse with some drinking involved, this thing was still going strong with no leaks or anything."
RV3FPCNQ2RIEL,"the cupholder was very handy and a nice, useful addition."
RV3FPCNQ2RIEL,"the toe strap thingy functions pretty nicely as a headrest, and even allows the float to be worn as a very fashion forward swim garment if you put your legs through it."
RV3FPCNQ2RIEL,everyone else threw their inflatables away after the weekend but you better believe i took this home to use again.
RV3FPCNQ2RIEL,if you get this everyone will be jealous of you.
RV3FPCNQ2RIEL,everyone.
R3OBZXOIU2W1JK,buyer beware.
R3OBZXOIU2W1JK,"this is not the fullsized, decentquality constructed game you remember."
R3OBZXOIU2W1JK,it is 3 inches tall and party favor quality.
R3OBZXOIU2W1JK,"inadequate size and quality was reason enough to return the product, but wait...the game also came prefilled with its own turbid water sealed inside."
R3OBZXOIU2W1JK,no refill port with that goofy plastic plug of yesteryear.
R3OBZXOIU2W1JK,"typically, a $5 item is not worth the time and effort to go through a return process, but this one was."
R3OBZXOIU2W1JK,i dont mind paying a little extra for the convenience factor but this price was insulting... but wait again... the item is nonreturnable from this seller.
R3OBZXOIU2W1JK,"curious, i wonder why."
R3OBZXOIU2W1JK,"amazon should pull this product.now please excuse me, i must go yell at some children to get off of my lawn."
R2QPBCR5C290Z7,"fast and safe, thank you"
RWAMLAOVZN40L,bought this for my siblings and they love it.
RWAMLAOVZN40L,im glad they do.
RWAMLAOVZN40L,"great value too, i saw this same thing in target for 15 bucks!"
R322L3NK5F78VG,this was received as a gift.my daughter loves it so i give it two starts for concept.
R322L3NK5F78VG,but these should definitely be used on a cookie tray or something.
R322L3NK5F78VG,once they get wet they stick to each other....or anything else!
R322L3NK5F78VG,that includes the broom you try to sweep them up with.
R322L3NK5F78VG,and &34wet&34 includes a humid night.
R322L3NK5F78VG,i am peeling beados off the bottom of my feet right now because they rolled off her desk.
R322L3NK5F78VG,from my perspective they are the worst gift she has ever received.
R322L3NK5F78VG,do not do these in a carpeted room.
R322L3NK5F78VG,the lint will stick to the beads if they fall.
R322L3NK5F78VG,ironing the other beados was not a problem for me.
R322L3NK5F78VG,these are a disaster!
R1PT1F6J9IF8BY,"a little smaller than i was hoping, but thats why you need to double check the specs!"
R4DACJXTHWCT,i love it works great.
R2L2M7DG38US2B,my three year old is obsessed with play doh and loves this set!
R2L2M7DG38US2B,there are so many cookie cutters and such a great deal!
RLT9IR249VAYX,excellent rubiks cube.
RLT9IR249VAYX,the reason i left off a star is that it is rather expensive.
R1PDAQKID6EM46,fun for the whole family.
R3TKCKGKSYYLKR,these crosses works out great for our craft project.
R3TKCKGKSYYLKR,very reasonably priced.
R390OXEF99MNGW,in the tool box
R2BK817CLAIMQI,nice for treat bags
R3HBJ12OLY8S66,bought this for me 15 month son.
R3HBJ12OLY8S66,he loves it.
R3HBJ12OLY8S66,comes with all the stuff needed to play at bbq.
R3HBJ12OLY8S66,it does offer the feature to be placed at two different heights so you can get a few years out of it before your child becomes too old for it.
R32S2TPKZ319BH,"great quality, the only bummer is that some had chains that were long enough to be a necklace, but the majority only had key chain length chains."
R2GGJSOYMMX7SL,great great great.
R2GGJSOYMMX7SL,i gotta get more.
R2GGJSOYMMX7SL,they are cool.
R2GGJSOYMMX7SL,ive been waiting my whole life for this
R375RYYOMURW7L,love it
R2S8C99UT7HOOW,it is a quick game that demands teamwork.
R2S8C99UT7HOOW,it has some replay value.
R2S8C99UT7HOOW,"the more people, the more difficult."
R2AOTQR6DPOFBJ,it is okay.
R2AOTQR6DPOFBJ,the plastic screws are somewhat loose and come off easily.
R2AOTQR6DPOFBJ,i think the middle screws should be metal.
R166EPHW19ZP7,videoidfcec8e55b13ac4fd405d71cc1f4e793fmy boys love this and my four year old will set and play with it forever!
R166EPHW19ZP7,its very sturdy and is perfect for little hands to use.
R166EPHW19ZP7,the tools easily fit into place and it wipes clean easily.i was sent this product in exchange for a honest review.
R166EPHW19ZP7,the opinions above are my own.
R1ZOA0XUYYW7CC,had lots of fun playing this game
R283SCN7TWBZ3H,my 6 year old loves these.
R283SCN7TWBZ3H,really enjoys building w them.
RNUZI4YAEZ4DY,a little on the small side but very adorable.
RNUZI4YAEZ4DY,paint is nicely done.
RNUZI4YAEZ4DY,we collect banks for our grandsons.
RNUZI4YAEZ4DY,some of them have arrived with very sloppy paint jobs.
RNUZI4YAEZ4DY,not this one!
RNUZI4YAEZ4DY,cute cute cute!
R1M3UYRN9S2ASG,"so cute, and so soft!"
R1M3UYRN9S2ASG,we love jellycats!
R127MYJPNBGV5S,"fun for awhile, but kind of messy for little ones."
R1J0AFXJJM3RYP,too small for my 5 year old.....was disappointed.
R1J0AFXJJM3RYP,it was his birthday.
R1XOG1EGPJ3H4Q,"these were very expensive for what we received, not worth the price, and the lager items would never for on cupcakes."
R1XOG1EGPJ3H4Q,"none of the items had picks, so they would not stand up on the cupcakes."
RPFULFIWCUTYU,this is fun and keeps kids and adults entertained.
R2R0TYBR2EDNCC,great product but the blocks are larger than other sets.
R2JL3DU8X1FXV,"i love lego for a long time, not because how beautiful when it finished, just because i really enjoy the process."
RX10T6M0PDOZ5,theyre so cute!
RX10T6M0PDOZ5,a perfect edition to my collection!
RX10T6M0PDOZ5,they also came about 2 weeks ahead of schedule!
R1QGRJ9IFDCZRJ,speedy delivery.
R1QGRJ9IFDCZRJ,my boyfriend and i played this last night and we loved it!
R1QGRJ9IFDCZRJ,its so much more fun than any of the other trivial pursuit games.
R1QGRJ9IFDCZRJ,"its more like a party game, with much easier and fun questions than the older goes."
R1QGRJ9IFDCZRJ,i almost beat my bf at this game!
R1QVQX59JSZXCA,very useful
R1A459AU4OOJ61,perfect costume and it fit as expected.
R1A459AU4OOJ61,the size small was good for a child of about 41 pounds
RW7Y0Z0C0DAD8,flimsy but fun for smaller kiddos.
R20WLWNK32FHFP,worked as desired
RPHJPJRXPBO7R,my daughter loves these!
RPHJPJRXPBO7R,"anything mini is fun, and if its edible, bonus!"
RPHJPJRXPBO7R,will it feed your family at four?
RPHJPJRXPBO7R,nope.
RPHJPJRXPBO7R,great activity for a rainy day?
RPHJPJRXPBO7R,yep.
RPHJPJRXPBO7R,"have fun, childhood is short!"
R3IVF3Z67SW7X4,the ladybug eggs arrived dead even though they were ordered to be rushed which cost extra in mailing fees.
R3IVF3Z67SW7X4,a ladybug land is not very exciting to a 5 year old without ladybugs.
R15U6WMPDTO0TL,this is going to take some work
RW6OVO5LPB64O,the grandkids love it!
R1EOI3D8267FSI,breaks the first time is falls
R36SKVJXZ0I98A,the syma helicopter is very easy to fly!
R36SKVJXZ0I98A,i was surprised at the fact i could keep it in the air without losing control or hitting a wall!
R36SKVJXZ0I98A,i have mastered landing it on my remote control helicopter landing pad!can be flown indoors or outdoors.
R36SKVJXZ0I98A,"when flying outdoors the wind may effect your flying as this helicopter is very light.has red and blue lights that flash which allows you to fly at night, pair it with a remote control helicopter landing pad and you have the perfect set up for night flying.flying time has ranged from 7 to 15 minutes for me, flying time is less outside depending on the breeze.very easy to control, although i have yet to master what every button on the remote does!"
R36SKVJXZ0I98A,"i just press the buttons, push the joys stick in every which direction and go!"
R36SKVJXZ0I98A,flies like a dream for me!i received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review.
RLKVB53813M58,exactly what i needed.
RLKVB53813M58,i wanted more but i got all they had.
RLKVB53813M58,now ill have to pay more shipping.
R2XAMXKA0W4VOT,really cute bear.
R2XAMXKA0W4VOT,tha shipiment was perfect.
R2XAMXKA0W4VOT,it arived before the expected date.
R1MFDNFLK17KYG,wonderful toy from the movie...
R3E6A4X87Q9GX2,my little girl loved this dress!
R3E6A4X87Q9GX2,"its very well made, the fabric is great quality and the fit is perfect!"
R1RDUQM7M7GR9K,i bought this for our trip for boys to use in the car.
R1RDUQM7M7GR9K,they used it twice and the big doodle board broke.
R1RDUQM7M7GR9K,i would not recommend this item to my friends.
R30RP2PNIET8U,these are not kelly doll shoes.
R30RP2PNIET8U,"they are cheap, fake knock offs that do not fit kelly dolls."
R30RP2PNIET8U,a big waste of money.
R30RP2PNIET8U,"if you really, really work hard you can sometimes get one of the shoes onto the older models of kelly dolls."
R30RP2PNIET8U,even then you are in danger of the shoe splitting in the back and coming off the doll.
R30RP2PNIET8U,they definitely do not fit the new chelsea that came after kelly.
R30RP2PNIET8U,these are poorly made and there is lots of left over plastic tags here and there on the shoes that would have been removed in a more quality oriented manufacturing process.
R30ITGP8GM2THJ,hours of fun!
R30ITGP8GM2THJ,!
R1MZQBHLTJOSBU,unbelievable product.
R1MZQBHLTJOSBU,fantastic.
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"our soontobe2yearold is also a soontobebigsister and loves babies, so we got this for her for her birthday."
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"we opened it up to check it out, but its not quite her birthday yet, so she has yet to play with it."
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,here are a few observations  the packaging is not frustration free.
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,at all.
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"the size of a very small baby, yet it looks alert and it is somehow holding its head upthis doll has some features that are ""preemie"" and others that are 36 months."
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"thats fine, thoughi cant think of any little kids that would hold these anachronisms against it."
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"my wife and i agree that the baby is very lifelike without being too ""creepy"" type ""uncanny valley"" into your favorite search engine."
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"all the pink implies this is a girl, but if you take the diaper off, it is genderless."
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,the overall weight and weight distribution seems about right for a human of that size.
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"the plastic is somewhat soft, though much harder than real skin would be."
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"there is a chemical smell from the plastic that i found unpleasant, but it is slight and i expect it will offgasdisappear quickly."
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,i gave it to our 7 and 9 year old girls to play with for a while and they thought it was very cute and fun to pretend with.
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,im excited for our little ones birthdayi think shell love it.
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"update attached is a picture of our 2 day old, 8 pound and a few ounces baby next to the doll as a size comparison."
R2AB3IAZJAO1L6,"also, it should be noted that the 2 year old likes the doll and i think its a very good size for her."
R5FVAUQMO7560,doesnt hold up well.
RWAC8V9H2OB2N,old game but a lot of fun
R2GRB5OM4YCCM,"enjoyed the movie as a former wildland firefighter, and now both my son and i can enjoy cabbie.hes one of the lesserknown characters in the movie planes fire & rescue he has maybe two lines, total but of all the character toys, i believe he has the most functions."
R2GRB5OM4YCCM,"his propellers move, his back hatch opens, and you can loadunload three smokejumpers more if the smaller ones are upside down.if youre interested to read more about smokejumpers, read murray taylors book &34jumping fire&34, a firsthand account."
R11MFJ1TWPQ5JJ,now a world traveller
R24WX4LRGB0B35,"it is nice, however, if your kids keep touchning it, like mine did, it broke in matter of weeks.not as sturdy as i would have wanted it to be."
R24WX4LRGB0B35,"otherwise, i like it."
R12ZA5J4FVRT8U,beautiful marbles.
R1Z3N733LBUDZI,much smaller than expected  intended to use in sand box but theyre way too small for that.
R35JO6K6NLE8N2,"corolle is a great brand on their dolls, but unfortunately this product doesnt seem to be as high of quality."
R35JO6K6NLE8N2,"it does seem somewhat sturdy, decent size, and about what i would expect for the cost."
R35JO6K6NLE8N2,it is just not to the quality i would have expected from corolle.
RVPTC4SYO09QQ,thank you
R1FB4Y5L64CRH3,we had the base game for several months and with just two of us playing it was fast and getting kind of predictable after some properties were bought.
R1FB4Y5L64CRH3,this harbor expansion really made it lots more fun.
R1FB4Y5L64CRH3,"i guess the variation we play is not according to the rules 552, but it offers different options every game."
R1FB4Y5L64CRH3,"if you accumulate the right combination of properties and get lucky on the roll of the dice, you can rake in lots of money quickly and sweep to a great victory!"
R1FB4Y5L64CRH3,"it is one of our favorites,"
R2194P8X9P4CMZ,gotta love grammy when she buys an awesome lego set for the grand child
R1RE8LG2H3G0XN,so adorable!!!
R1RE8LG2H3G0XN,!
R2QDNDGI5BK9DQ,my grandson loves this puzzle
R12A31P8ZWS2QP,great collectible.
R2NML8AK2WYXVI,the kid loved it
R7F7FEGUY7IIK,hilarious game to play and even more cards.
R3F9SGQF0QNC6J,just as described.. a big hit with the children.. some on the erasers fall out of top when used.
RS41K1MEKC0IY,i was excited about this product and still am when it works.
RS41K1MEKC0IY,i received to ozobots and only the black one would work.
RS41K1MEKC0IY,the white one would have worked if i could manage to turn it on and then if i managed to turn it off.
RS41K1MEKC0IY,the area you push to turn on the unit was not aligned correctly so you could press for hours and it would come on.
RS41K1MEKC0IY,if you did get it on you couldnt get it off so it just ran out the charge.
RS41K1MEKC0IY,i sent an email to see about a fix or a replacement but never heard back from the manufacture and nothing on the site talks about hardware issue just software problems.
RS41K1MEKC0IY,so i give them two stars for one working unit and one not and no response or help.
RS41K1MEKC0IY,fyi this problem existed straight out of the box.
R2O1SJ7AGMND23,okay
R322D80NJC9W0H,it is terrific for training toddlers to swim with confidence.
R1T2ATQRRR4ASG,good product
R3TOPIH60MUWO1,great product!
R2CGL2UKKRB0FF,my kindergartner loves her new nap mat.
R2CGL2UKKRB0FF,most mats are only 58&34 thick and have a thin mil plastic covering.
R2CGL2UKKRB0FF,the thin mil plastic tears easily and generally has to be taped several times to get through the year.
R2CGL2UKKRB0FF,this one seems much more durable.
R2CGL2UKKRB0FF,"well see if it can last the year, but from the feel of the plastic, if it doesnt last out the year nothing will.i also love the extra thickness of this mat."
R2CGL2UKKRB0FF,i didnt want my little girl to feel like she was sleeping against the floor like you do with those 58&34 mats.
R2CGL2UKKRB0FF,"the way the measuring works is if it says it is a 1&34 mat, it is actually only 58&34 of foam."
R2CGL2UKKRB0FF,"if it advertises 2&34 like this one, you get 112&34 of foam thickness."
R2CGL2UKKRB0FF,"that makes it pretty much like lumber measurements, so its good to know before you buy.while this will take up twice the storage space of the thinner mats, it is much higher quality and will provide better support and comfort for your child.hint, you can use a kingsize pillow case to slip over the mat as a covering, and it is usually roomy enough to allow the child to use it as a sleeping bag."
R11C2DPK9R8QQN,so disappointed most every one of these did not light up... the ones that did light up did not light up all the way!!!
R11C2DPK9R8QQN,do not waste your money
R2IP7VYKHD2U54,"thanatos is one of my favorite characters, but lasted little in the series, i liked mainly by wearing armor."
R2IP7VYKHD2U54,"the figure of thanatos is heavy, the large number of parts and a little purple color, which in truth is gray."
R17P1UHC49V1LR,my granddaughter loves it!my granddaughter loves it!
R2KAD4T8LCISJO,great
R27EVOJMJIWTAT,excelent
R14N4HOXS77KZY,the frozen ice skate castle was a huge hit with my granddaughter 4 yrs old.
R14N4HOXS77KZY,we couldnt quite get the hang of the skating snow flakes but it didnt seem to take away from the fun.
R14N4HOXS77KZY,i would purchase this again if i had the need.
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,i like almost everything about this game.
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,"the activities are learningoriented and work on more than just colors, shapes and the normal preschool stuff.basically, you take a picture of a card with a pup, and that is your character in the game."
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,you drive him around with your finger or the stylus and he finds people to help.
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,"when you tap the people that you help, they give you an activity that helps with learning shapes, numbers and colors."
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,the nice thing is it also works on fine motor skills.
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,"for example, one of the games requires you to fill the fountain up with water."
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,"its a counting game, but you also have to move the stylus in a circle."
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,it also works on fine motor as you have to drive the pup around.i wasnt a fan of the cards.
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,"i dont think my threeyearold gets them, and i think he would get frustrated."
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,"luckily, they have a digital card picker, and you can use your stylus to choose the card you need for the game."
R3N4WD79GOBSWP,"i think this would have been a great game without cards to store.overall, it is a fun game, and my threeyearold enjoys it"
R3L15AN7SAWCXI,"got it on time, no issues."
R30YQ8SVJ797JF,"1st of all, i guess i didnt read this properly, but for some reason i thought it was big enough to stand in."
R30YQ8SVJ797JF,"not very happy with it, 2nd of all, over priced."
R30YQ8SVJ797JF,"and lastly, every single rod was bent."
R30YQ8SVJ797JF,i also had to tape the rods to the connecting ends at every corner because theyd slide out.
R30YQ8SVJ797JF,"if i could go back & keep my self from buying this, i would"
R3G3C8EV3GM6LV,"so, so, so much fun."
R3G3C8EV3GM6LV,these were are quick way to get some fun going at the park
R17SSMVU1MKICH,"for the price, this works just fine."
R17SSMVU1MKICH,its pretty flimsy but serves its purpose.
R17SSMVU1MKICH,turned it into a reading room for my niece and nephew and they loved it.
R17SSMVU1MKICH,hes six and its a little small for him  shes 18 months so it seems huge to her.
R3TBM2H9FM8U14,ordered 3. all showed up with one side already burnt out.
R3TBM2H9FM8U14,dont bother.
R1HRSCK83CAA7L,"only 3 out of the 12 worked, and only for a short while."
R1HRSCK83CAA7L,had to return all of them.
RO04VDM25N58I,very soft and cuddly.
RO04VDM25N58I,my grandson loves it.
RDBR4SRWXVMNT,just what i wanted.
RDBR4SRWXVMNT,the size and replica of the plane is great.
R1MR9JGFGLZNXE,just got a chance to use these this past weekend.
R1MR9JGFGLZNXE,"while some did not fill up, it was a very small  and i was very pleased with not having to fill up some by hand and then try to tie off those little boogers.... ill definitely be reordering these."
R3M3NNWSSM90TU,cousin loves it!!
R3M3NNWSSM90TU,!
R2B7VJH1SGW8Q8,"love these sleeves, will buy again,"
R1R0HQW9WB9LHS,it was a gift he loved them!
R1R0HQW9WB9LHS,!
R3DYCABDJUP54T,the gift recipient has had a barrel of laughs with it.
R30L6YMHZPZFCB,it is really fun!
R2ADGWMKGIWNNP,this creepy cloth gives a really cool effect to your decorations.
R2ADGWMKGIWNNP,"i really like how it looks when its in your window with silhouettes cut out of black construction paper, you can make pumpkins with scary faces, bats, a full moon, spiders stuff to keep it easy for you and the kids and if you want to have some extra fun you can do a witch on a broomstick flying past a moon or something more complex.it also looks really good to decorate an office or school setting i posted a picture of it hanging in our office with a crow sitting on top."
R2ADGWMKGIWNNP,we havent finished decorating but you can see the creepy cloth best here when its not covered up.
R2ADGWMKGIWNNP,it just adds that little extra something to the background so youre not just decorating a while wall or door.
R2ADGWMKGIWNNP,really makes a difference!
R2ADGWMKGIWNNP,i definitely recommend getting a few of these for a creepy setting for your other halloween decorations!
R3RYT7V7FU4D8M,excelente
RZ1HCD4RHQI7U,great!
RZ1HCD4RHQI7U,as described!
R3H438O2T6I1DJ,this was clearly the best a bracket i found on any site.
R3H438O2T6I1DJ,it was welded and heavy duty.
R3H438O2T6I1DJ,the 4x6 and 4x4s slid easily into place with only one being a really snug fit treated wood was still wet from the treatment and was swelled.
R3H438O2T6I1DJ,i used 14 galvanized wood threaded bolts and washers on each bracket.
R3H438O2T6I1DJ,predrilling the holes with a drill bit smaller than the galvanized threads allows for easier assembly and minimizes wood cracking.
R3H438O2T6I1DJ,"my daughters now have a three swing swing set that is as big, if not bigger than the metal framed swings you find at most parks."
R3H438O2T6I1DJ,they will never outgrow this mammoth of a swing set!
R328U4TMALV2YU,i bought them fit a nerf bow.
R328U4TMALV2YU,one was ruined in the package.
R328U4TMALV2YU,another had the blue part of the arrow fall off within 5 minutes.
R328U4TMALV2YU,very disappointing.
R2WH007NSBDB8B,she is adorable .
R2CIX43YU01YLJ,perfect
R1JV6QNDC8RTLG,its very safe and good my daughter really love it.
R1JV6QNDC8RTLG,she cant put the doll down
R2UMNK1SRCL4CG,excellent helicopter.
R2UMNK1SRCL4CG,great for 9 year old.
R2UMNK1SRCL4CG,this is the 2nd one weve purchased.
R2UMNK1SRCL4CG,the first one lasted about a year until the battery stopped holding a charge.
R1ELOKZ7KY7VOO,like most small lego sets.
R1ELOKZ7KY7VOO,my son enjoyed putting it together.
R1ELOKZ7KY7VOO,likes to combine pieces with other sets.
R8XJCH0HBHLZE,i was worried about receiving something cheap if i ordered online.
R8XJCH0HBHLZE,not the case!
R8XJCH0HBHLZE,"this little simba is darling, soft, and well made."
R8XJCH0HBHLZE,its paw is asked as an official disney plush animal.
R8XJCH0HBHLZE,i couldnt have found better in a store.
R8XJCH0HBHLZE,my daughter adores it!
R8XJCH0HBHLZE,i highly recommend.
R13Y6B0VAJBQ3W,"this is a very cute, wellmade cuddly for little ones."
RIZQB5X02JPKU,these guys dont stay bent and arent good quality
R1I5LE6IAQD8I9,thanks.
R3YN4MXZIPZSR,"my first lab has a wellknown history for good microscopes, especially for kids, in a decent price range."
R3YN4MXZIPZSR,this one is definitely a very beginner microscope and has a lot more of a toy feel than many other &34first&34 microscopes&34 but is lighter and easier for a kid to move.
R3YN4MXZIPZSR,it does have dual lights above and below that allow for easy viewing of slides  this user experience was that solid objects were not permeated by the light.
R3YN4MXZIPZSR,"its battery powered, using 3 aaa batteries not included."
R3YN4MXZIPZSR,"the eyepiece offers 10x magnification and the wheel allows for 40x, 100x, and 400x magnification."
R3YN4MXZIPZSR,"the eyepiece and tubing is smaller for littler eyes, but might prove a little problematic for bigger eyes that are helping the little ones focus.im not sure how they get to 40 accessories, but it does come with brine shrimp eggs specimen vial 1 yeast specimen vial 3 empty specimen vials graduated cylinder 8 blank slides hatchery specimen slicer prepared slides 8 slide labels & 8 cover slips plastic transfer pipet magnifying glass plastic forcepsfor very young kids, adults purchasing this will need to also purchase some additional slides for them to view."
R3YN4MXZIPZSR,"however, its a decent microscope that will teach kids the basics of how to use one, and can provide a lot of cool opportunities for looking at the world in a very different way."
R3RDQO7R9KDNH5,love it
RHUQ20RQSQOXV,ok
R31CF9C86MYBWB,just what i wanted.
R2XBTEFEF2WIRG,shipped quickly.easy to applyproblem is they dont stick as well as i would like.
R2XBTEFEF2WIRG,slowly peeling off the walls and door.
R2XBTEFEF2WIRG,followed the directions to the &34t&34 and still not 100 effective.
R1VUYIFDA5AYXN,grandsons love it
R1YTE18T5FSVFZ,we had this toy and our son loved it for several months but then it broke when an older child played with it.
R1YTE18T5FSVFZ,our friends bought us a new one and within one week it came apart again.
REWJGG7NRPQQ0,works great on my activity table for the lego challenge

R9QX96LQB3B1J,poorly made game!
R9QX96LQB3B1J,"the puppie pegs would not stay in the cars, neither would the little dog faces."

RTTWHFXZ95AJ5,"we always seem to have one laying out on the table, and when friends and family drop by they cant resist collaborating on putting together the different collections of things from beer caps, old magazine, to candy and bumper stickers."
RTTWHFXZ95AJ5,the vintage collections bring back a lot of good memories for the older folks who work on them with us.

R2KW5W8E9NQN7Q,"this is our second set for our two boys, 6 and 4 years old!"
R2KW5W8E9NQN7Q,"they love them, because they are big enough to stand and push them around more like run around the yard, or beach."
R2KW5W8E9NQN7Q,the are also pretty durable.
R2KW5W8E9NQN7Q,i believe our old ones lasted 3 years before the wheels started to come off and not stay on.
R2KW5W8E9NQN7Q,thats three years of beaches and backyards!
R2KW5W8E9NQN7Q,and we love the new colors!my only issue and why i gave 4 stars is the attachment for the back.
R2KW5W8E9NQN7Q,"its not permanently attached, and sometimes comes off when you dont want it to.these are a pretty good deal!"
R1YEGB9NIFVOV1,they do the job.

R3THYOL1798RM,useless for use by my daughter now.
R3THYOL1798RM,"i called fisherprice and they said since it was made by a company under license to them, they would contact me directly within 3 days."
R3THYOL1798RM,no one ever called.

R3ME69LEZZ9ORU,a
R3DY61U6FXG5Q9,this game is great!
R3DY61U6FXG5Q9,i seriously enjoy playing this game.
R3DY61U6FXG5Q9,but i have to give it a 2 star rating because this particular generation of the game is almost unplayable.
R3DY61U6FXG5Q9,the difference between the orange and the yellow is extremely slight.
R3DY61U6FXG5Q9,"im mildly colorblind, and i have to have the 0 for the yellow and orange side by side on the table just so i can identify the color of the cards in my hand."
R3DY61U6FXG5Q9,my spouse is not at all colorblind and she can barely tell the color difference.
R3DY61U6FXG5Q9,"the red and green is also not noticeably different to a typical colorblind person, but i can tell the difference.i have purchased 3 previous generations of this game, none of which have suffered from this problem."
R3DY61U6FXG5Q9,"i really, really have no idea what the printersdesigners were thinking making the colors so similar."
R23RE0S6POXVGM,"nice, smooth movement."
R23RE0S6POXVGM,has held up good..
R11C31FKM6C9RP,our family plays a lot of board games.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,we have one designated evening each week that is a mandatory family game night.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,no one is allowed to miss it.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,one of our favorite games is jenga!
R11C31FKM6C9RP,"when i saw the baxbo tummple, i decided i needed to see how it compared."
R11C31FKM6C9RP,it is so much better!!
R11C31FKM6C9RP,!the first thing i noticed when opening was the quality of the box it is stored in.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,the box is very thickheavy and holds all of the pieces perfectly.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,it also has the directions printed in the lid so there is no concerns of losing them.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,the instructions seemed minimal but once you play a few times you realize that they are as thorough as they need to be.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,the only issue i see that might arise in the future is what to do if there is a tie.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,there is no information provided for that scenario.the game itself is simple.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,rolling the dice will tell you which side you need to place the dice.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,"each time the structure falls, the person who made the blocks fall must put them in a pile in front of them."
R11C31FKM6C9RP,"at the end of the game, the person with the most &34negative points&34 aka the most blocks, loses!"
R11C31FKM6C9RP,my youngest son is our avid jenga player.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,i will update once he plays this with us to let you know a childs perspective.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,his older brother and i played this several times to see what we thought of it as this will be a christmas gift for the youngest.i purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest review of the product.
R11C31FKM6C9RP,i am selective in what i test and review and will always give an honest opinion.
R3N9HK4VX13T3B,my grand daughter loves it.
R2OD7OF38RGT9B,the kids love this toy.

RCA0I78Q1E23I,"i must say, he enjoys this very much, and his parents are pleased with it as well."
RCA0I78Q1E23I,"very wellmade, durable, etc."
RJDIWMOZT0EGZ,overpriced and underwritten.
RJDIWMOZT0EGZ,please dont waste your time on this.
RJDIWMOZT0EGZ,it isnt even really fantasy since the company is trying to create their own ip by using their own made up races.
R3QQNB9BHUBFGI,its a swapping head for the normal swapping style barbie dolls.
R3QQNB9BHUBFGI,not a styling head!

R2GDS92T21HI0,my daughter is enjoying the coat for her doll.
R3H8YKY1Y2IO5M,"this is the second puzz 3d ive built, and the tabs didnt line up correctly, even after i tore it apart when the eye didnt line up with the smile."
R3H8YKY1Y2IO5M,"the part 7s and 1s that build the head were not cut correctly, as were several other parts."
R3H8YKY1Y2IO5M,"as many have mentioned, the tabs bend too easily then youre stuck trying to make it work later."
R3H8YKY1Y2IO5M,"the 91 piece is listed as ""easy"" but i managed to need scissors and tape to make it work."
R3H8YKY1Y2IO5M,disappointed in this product.
R3VH9ZEDSBZMY3,what an awesome lego set.

R10DJ9A2UL36OL,always awesome
RM4CR35YMR7XU,"great for any age, our 4 yo granddaughter likes t. can be a small frustration when the magnets cling when she doesnt want them to, but this helps her understand physics of magnets."
R3K5G3NDNMJSGR,"i recieved early, and i love the contain of the product, thanks, please consider to open a store in this country."
R3CLP5VVTTPABW,we have mostly played the transform blaze and lane racing.
R3CLP5VVTTPABW,"i think in this particular game, my kids are learning about science and physics without even realizing it."
R3CLP5VVTTPABW,there is less overt education and more exploration and experimentation.
R3CLP5VVTTPABW,they love playing this one together and racing against each other.
R3CLP5VVTTPABW,"the most ""video game"" feel of all the leaptv games we have."
R250HX141ZEQRO,these dice are fantastic.
R250HX141ZEQRO,ive used the chessex brand of dice for most of my years rpging at the tabletop.
R250HX141ZEQRO,"the quality of chessex dice is bar none and if you need to as i did, you can simply call or email chessex for a replacement die if you have a defective one."
R250HX141ZEQRO,i had a d10 without the gold imprint on one side of my die and it was quickly replaced.
R250HX141ZEQRO,"as the customer service response was immediate to a product defect, i still rate these five stars and recommend anyone to purchase game die for any game needs from chessex.in addition, youll find that the sheer variety they have to offer is huge."
R250HX141ZEQRO,dont settle for white dice with black pips!!
R250HX141ZEQRO,!

R11LE5W14GGBF,amazing i love it
R308XZZY597XKQ,i love the game but the box sent to us had missing strategic dominoes and duplicates of a lot of other dominoes so the game could not be played with the equipment provided.
R308XZZY597XKQ,poor quality control..
R1RJ05K4LJF0HP,"this is a very cute keychain and item, but its kind of cheap because in the next 6 months of owning it, it broke into three, and all of the buns ripped."

R3G84OZOVC5TK7,"poor quality, a lot money for the product."
RVGMJX8678L8N,"im a big fan of nerf toys, and was hoping for excellence here."
RVGMJX8678L8N,"it got close, but suffered a few flaws.first of all, this thing launches nerf mega darts like a champion, at least when it feeds properly."
RVGMJX8678L8N,"range is phenomenal, and the whistling darts are hilarious."
RVGMJX8678L8N,"each pump action rotates the cylinder and cocks it, just like a pumpaction shotgun, though i was not able to hold the trigger down and continuously pump it to fire as fast as possible not a big deal, just a fact.unfortunately, as i said, it suffers feed problems occasionally, and ive had darts jam in the barrel and muck the entire thing up."
RVGMJX8678L8N,"but when its running solidly, its incredibly fun."
RVGMJX8678L8N,i had my daughters 18yearold boyfriend in a cringing in a corner and screaming like a baby.
RVGMJX8678L8N,"big fun.however, once youve exhausted your ammo and its time to reload, youd better find some good cover its a real pain to get the darts back in the chamber."
RVGMJX8678L8N,"it doesnt open, so you need to jam them into the exposed chambers and then rotate the cylinder to expose more."
RVGMJX8678L8N,"if youre in a nerfordie situation, youd better have someone covering your back or be carrying a backup nerf, because youre going to be hurting.when its loaded and feeding smoothly though, its a gas."
RVGMJX8678L8N,and now my entire family is terrified.
RVGMJX8678L8N,awesome.

R2WADEJ5DQMQVS,sounds too good to be true right?
R2WADEJ5DQMQVS,exactly.
R2WADEJ5DQMQVS,"has no jam door, so to unjam the blaster you need to take it apart which can be tricky."

R3N71LBQXK3Y0N,my four year old absolutely loves playing with this set.
R3N71LBQXK3Y0N,i would give it five stars but for the back hinge always coming apart.
R3N71LBQXK3Y0N,the toy is meant to be played with open or closed and the hinge to do that just is not sturdy enough and comes apart pretty easily with normal  not rough play.
R3N71LBQXK3Y0N,"getting it back together requires a little muscle and im afraid eventually its just not going to stay together ever the hinge is plastic on plastic.other than that he loves it, and the details are great."

R3RZS0NM8PF32T,"however, i have dozens more of o gauge rail cars and locomotives i will eventually weather and spray."
R3RZS0NM8PF32T,i just went ahead and bought a quart of lacquer and a small bottle of gloss reducereliminator from the local auto paint supply store and shoot it through my little detail sprayer.
R3RZS0NM8PF32T,i can also control how dull it gets by how much of the deglosser i add.
R3RZS0NM8PF32T,i got a lifetime supply of dull lacquer now for just the cost of a few of these cans.
R18L3EKPY1E6KC,got it quick and in excellent condition!

RR07RJ3WKD9GT,young kids love driving games.
RR07RJ3WKD9GT,"there is something bout the thrill of doing something grownup that has that appeal.my five yearold twins thoroughly enjoy this game, and i secretly enjoy it because the girls are learning important stem skills without even realizing it!i also enjoy that there is a two player mode on the game, so that the girls can play together.it is fun to see them experiment with cause and effect when constructing their super duper stunt track, and they are motivated to keep playing so that they earn more track pieces.this is a fun game, far beyond the recommended ages of 35. i predict a lot of replay at our house!disclosure we were given a copy of this game to facilitate my review."
RR07RJ3WKD9GT,"however, all opinions are my own."
R24YYS3C6CDO2V,just right.
R3IWU35JYVBXB1,over half of these did not light up... waste of money!!

R1Y9WOSD06BGO0,"i dont think its the worst thing in the world its certainly not 100 quality, but i like it is double sided and its a heavy duty pin."

R2HDT64DCMIODG,made really well.
R2HDT64DCMIODG,i am confident my daughter will be able to use this for the entire school year without it falling apart.
R2HDT64DCMIODG,she loves the 3d image of the characters.
R2HDT64DCMIODG,"perfect size to fit her lunch box, sneakers for gym and much, much more."
R2HDT64DCMIODG,im very happy with this purchase.
R120CJXHO7RR0F,"sometimes this product doesnt really pick up where the pen is so it is frustrating for my 3 year old to use, but mostly it is ok. she just doesnt reach for it very often."
R1DKGKWQQ32V6V,the stickers are a nice touch.
R1DKGKWQQ32V6V,wish it was completely stamped like a real license plate.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,this package arrived just in time for my sons 11th birthday and my 9 year old also enjoyed his big brother getting this gift.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,i have broken down the following pros and cons of the toys as i experienced them.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,"pros  the colors of the bots are bright and immediately attracted both of my boys to them  the ""spinning"" action of the toys has made my living room a fight to the death ring."
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,it is their favorite attack method  the controls are easy to learn  the additional weapons are interchangeable between the bots.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,"so each bot can have 1 blue and 1 yellow weapon which eliminated an almost argument about which weapon was ""superior"" and who got it!"
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,this was greatly appreciated  the battery life has been longer than i had expected.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,i spent a little extra and bought the extended life batteries so i am not sure if that made the difference but it was worth noting.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,i havent had to change the batteries since i put them in on august 24th and they have played with them every day.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,cons  the robots seem to have a cheap feel to them.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,they have lasted a weeks worth of play with no breakage but when i first opened the box the feel of the toys was disappointing  they are small bots.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,not tiny but were smaller than what i expected when i saw the package online.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,i included two photos to show the packaging and then with the bots standing with the remote controls to try and show their size  they require 10 aaa batteries to start with.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,"i only had aa batteries on hand so i had to make an emergency trip to town to get the much needed batteries  the additional weapons didnt really seem to make much impact on the ""fighting""."
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,they seemed to be just for decoration and didnt really offer an advantage to having them on.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,they were very hard to get out of the packaging.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,it took both me and my husband to get the robots out of the packaging.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,"because they felt so fragile and cheap, we were afraid we would break them if we pulled too hard so it took some time to get them out."
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,make sure to have your scissors handy!
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,my boys biggest complaint was that the robots walked very slow.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,"the spinning action that they loved so much doesnt last very long so when that attack was no longer available they were unable to ""run away""."
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,overall i gave this 4 stars because of the amount of batteries required and the difficulty i experience with the packaging as well.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,both of my boys have really enjoyed these bots and it is another way for them compete with each other.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,"fifty dollars does seem quite pricy for this toy because i still believe the materials are a little cheap and i am unsure if they will still be functioning in a month or two however, i was lucky enough to receive this item free in a bzzkit."
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,my bzzagent name is jeleki.
RAIL3PJ7K94WV,i would recommend this product to anyone with boys who love robots and love to compete with each other and wants a toy that will be played with more than once.
R1TFG5GKU1CSRL,"cheap, bent when i recieved it"

RXGKLA928VS99,"yes, girls are just as inquisitive as boys."
RXGKLA928VS99,she is always full of questions wanting to know how things work.
RXGKLA928VS99,this simple toolkit is just the thing to keep her happy for hours.
RXGKLA928VS99,"she seemed a little disappointed there werent any electronic gizmos included, but i on the other hand felt it was more important to learn from hands on reading, writing, and working to solve problems and investigate."
RXGKLA928VS99,i enjoyed working with her to show her how to use the simple detective tools.
RXGKLA928VS99,this is a nice beginner kit to help spark a childs imagination.
RBVI9FCLQWY3C,one battery did not fit the copter.
RBVI9FCLQWY3C,dron stopped working before i could use all of the batteries.

R10JXENQ2RQO20,this is one of the funniest games weve ever played.
R10JXENQ2RQO20,"as big fans of cards against humanity, were definitely open to games that others may consider taboo due to strong language, irreverent themes and images, etc."
R10JXENQ2RQO20,"if youre one of those people, but still want to check this game out, i highly recommend you order the ""clean"" version of this game instead."
R10JXENQ2RQO20,"regardless of which version you get, its a lot of fun."
R10JXENQ2RQO20,"it takes a little bit to figure out the rules, but once you get them, its easy."
R10JXENQ2RQO20,"its a game of luck combined with strategy, and its a ton of fun."
R10JXENQ2RQO20,we played with 3 and 4 people so far and im going to order another set so we can play with a larger group.

R1HRKULLVNKPDA,"the package came with 3 attachments, each having balloons and black rubber rings to hold them on already assembled."
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,no instructions.
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,"the item is for one time use unless you buy a refill pack, which would be very time consuming to do."
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,"however, that aside we were ready to have a blast."
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,that feeling was short lived!
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,i attached the first one to the hose and only half the balloons would fill.
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,the others fell off with pretty much no water.
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,the biggest balloon got to about 2.5 inches big.
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,i thought ok maybe i did something wrong.
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,"as i was trying to put the non filled back on the spout, the 1015 that did fill deflated water."
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,imagine the disappointment of my 3 year old!!
R1HRKULLVNKPDA,we decided to give the second spout a try.

R32Y0GPHUQMLCD,"sticking the double stick tape to each star is a bit time consuming, but not a product flaw."
R32Y0GPHUQMLCD,each star is a pretty decent size and our son loves having them in his room!

R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,this is a great value for what youre paying.
R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,"essentially, this game is based on another very good game called heroscape."
R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,"youll build an arena out of the little pieces in this box, create an army, and do battle with one of the prepainted planeswalker minis.i picked this game up as a former mtg player."
R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,i was hugely involved in the game from ice age through darksteel.
R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,i invested thousands of dollars in the game until it finally became apparent that i couldnt afford to continue to be competitive in the game.
R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,"what i love about this is that there is a little of what i like about mtg  the deckbuilding, the spellcasting and the strategy  but not so much of what i dont like  the cost.the game itself is solid if not spectacular."
R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,"it accomodates up to 5 relatively seamlessly, and its easy to set up the game as a 2 vs. 2 if you like the team approach, or to just make it a freeforall."
R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,"the biggest problem to me with the game, enough to lower it two full stars, is that the game feels like it is missing some essential element that will be added through expansions."
R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,"its difficult to identify exactly what it is, but i cant shake the feeling that they took something essential out and going to release it as a big box expansion in the next few months.as it is, its a solid game that feels unfinished."
R1JYTH1KH4TVXX,ill eagerly look forward to the i&34m assuming forthcoming expansion.

RRUPHL91MP1C9,very good quality
R3OT87J41WYWEB,"this pendant is larger than id expected, and thus makes it look that much ""cheaper"" when looking at it."
R3OT87J41WYWEB,"for the price its okay maybe for a kid who is a fan of the show, but i cant say that id ever wear this out in public."

RUZWD9C3V65OL,"this game serves its purpose, but its nothing like in the picture."
RUZWD9C3V65OL,the moving piece is cheap and battery operated  definitely does not give the authentic satanic demonsummoning experience i thought i was paying for.
RUZWD9C3V65OL,"however, the board looks sturdy and glowinthedark, so thats a plus."
RUZWD9C3V65OL,definitely can not have the lights on when im calling to the spirits of the dead

R4FAGHJCUI8KI,my boys love it
R3STI571SAZPXA,right out of the box it turns nicely.
R3STI571SAZPXA,from time to time it will pop and explode but only if you are being forceful with it.
R3STI571SAZPXA,if it does that it is mainly human error.
R3STI571SAZPXA,i am afraid to take it apart and lube it.
R3STI571SAZPXA,i do not plan on ever moding it.
R3STI571SAZPXA,i will probably never be able to put it back together again.
R3STI571SAZPXA,but it might be my favorite cube i have and it was a decent price.
R3STI571SAZPXA,good job shengshou.

REH2K0SDFSMT0,the process of embossing the bracelets was very simple and fun.
REH2K0SDFSMT0,the colors and patterns were very colorful and there was a great variety of emoticons and lettersnumbers.
REH2K0SDFSMT0,the instructions were very detailed.
REH2K0SDFSMT0,"the only trouble was putting the text cool bracelet studio together, this would require an adult to help just to make sure it is done correctly and there isnt and embossing while setting up the bracelet to begin."
REH2K0SDFSMT0,very fun product for children and very nice that it can be personalized.
REH2K0SDFSMT0,packaging was great as well and all items were included.
R2BYXBKEUOH36Y,what a fun game!
R2BYXBKEUOH36Y,my daughter came home from summer camp ranting and raving about dutch blitz.
R2BYXBKEUOH36Y,"i though i had heard of just about every card based game that existed, but had never heard of this one."
R2BYXBKEUOH36Y,"the price was affordable, so i ordered the game."
R2BYXBKEUOH36Y,"when it arrived, she tore into the pack and gathered the family."
R2BYXBKEUOH36Y,we played all night!
R2BYXBKEUOH36Y,"it really is a fun, family game."

R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,"we have 3 kids a 8, 6 and 4 year old."
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,we have received quite a few different air hogs toys and was always disappointed of the quality.
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,"but, this one has outdone all of them."
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,it is by far the sturdyest and my kids have enjoyed it the most.
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,i had the opportunity to sample this through bzz agent.
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,they played with it non stop for 2 days.
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,my daughter loved it as well.
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,i was actually very surprised that it still worked after 2 days since in the past the air hog toys never really lasted in our home.
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,we have had the toy now for almost 2 weeks and my kids still pick it up and play with it.
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,i would actually even buy this as a present for a birthday party.
R3MPQ9R6NYRJ13,i give it a thugs up!
R5FCHEZV5K573,love it!
R2NEA6BJ95CQW3,"knock off versionive bought pop guns before with the same design look, but this one is a cheap knock off version."
R2NEA6BJ95CQW3,it arrived well package but doesnt work at all.
R2NEA6BJ95CQW3,"the string inside is too long, the cork is broken and the string isnt a good one, even if the pop would work, it would last about 5 mintues."
R2NEA6BJ95CQW3,im upset because &34this item is not eligible for returns&34 so they send you broken stuff without the opportunity for refund.
R2NEA6BJ95CQW3,what a waste.
R1OXW8O6AC7AOI,ever wanted and assassin to protect your office well here you have itlook great and having it on the top of the desk make him look ready for a leap of faithmust have for an ac fan.
R3NWRFUQ3E68EF,really love it .. plus my son love it.
R36426EF5S1INH,"its an amazing game, although i bought it used but its super clean."
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,"if you like speedbased puzzles, this game is for you."
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,"if you dont, you still might like it."
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,"this is not usually my cup of tea, but i really enjoyed playing this."
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,you get a card with a blank space that needs to be filled with 3 easy or 4 hard tetrislike pieces.
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,you roll a custom die to pick which set of pieces you have to use and have a minute sandtimer to get the puzzle completed.
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,"each board has 6 possible sets of pieces that will complete it.you collect gems for being the first and second person to finish up to 4 players, but all players who do complete theirs also get a draw a random gem from the bag."
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,"in this sense, there is quite a bit of randomness to the scoring, which serious gamers wont like."
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,but you could tweak the rules a bit for that if you really wanted and just assign gems based on firsttolast.
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,"however, the randomness does help offset anyone from crushing everyone else by possibly sticking them with lowpoint gems.the game is wellproduced and the box insert fits everything perfectly."
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,"the weirdest part of the components is the bag, which is way too big for its use."
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,"yes, youre supposed to reach in and grab a gem, but the back could be half the size and anyones hand could still fit in it."
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,its actually kind of annoying how big the gem bag is.
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,but that doesnt affect the game play.
RIKYO9E2BJJFK,its straight forward and fun!
R34HCOUXLKUZ8T,love it
RCIFDKXRYBXDY,came earlier than expected and my son loved the product
R3FCKGLWSAM5K9,"amazing quality first of all, these cards are amazing proxies but dont try to use em in ""official duels"" unless a judge is okay with it, if you have the real thing to show and look amazing in your binder!"
R12PMQRZ9RS811,this didnt work so well for me.
R12PMQRZ9RS811,it didnt fit onto anything i can use to get water into it.

R3V5RC64GTQ4C8,very excited to get the river expansion which is the reason i bought this.

R2CNSMORLSKFCI,best toy for all ages of kids.
R2CNSMORLSKFCI,i think my husband likes it more than my kids  i recommend you get the higher pieces of them.
R2CNSMORLSKFCI,if you start with the 48 its not enough to make fun things.
R2CNSMORLSKFCI,these are the best.
R3FDKK2P74HY7Y,one of our most enjoyed purchases out of our recent amazon orders.
R3FDKK2P74HY7Y,our kids love being able to jump in and out of the wagon while we are at the zoo or library.
R3FDKK2P74HY7Y,fantastic product that folds up into a convenient size for travel.
R3FDKK2P74HY7Y,"we were originally looking into getting a plastic one from step 2 or radio flyer, but i am glad my wife talked me into this one."
R3FDKK2P74HY7Y,it is the only one that could stay in our van all of the time.
R3FDKK2P74HY7Y,thanks!

R156XD70JUCY6O,our grandson loved this.
R156XD70JUCY6O,shipping was timely and good.
RX8FU73QMY9FK,my toddler started watching chuggington on tv and this was perfect for him to play with.
RX8FU73QMY9FK,the very first thing i noticed about these chuggington trains is that it is very securely packaged.
RX8FU73QMY9FK,each one was individually packaged and all 6 of them are separated by a piece of tissue paper in a box.
RX8FU73QMY9FK,"each one has an id card with their picture, name, and number on it except for one."
RX8FU73QMY9FK,its okay if you misplace the cards or dont know all their names because the names are printed underneath each train.
RX8FU73QMY9FK,they can all connect to one another.
RX8FU73QMY9FK,there are 3 trains that have movable parts to keep the kids busy.
RX8FU73QMY9FK,my toddler and his older siblings were able to play with these trains on the other brand train tracks we already have.
RX8FU73QMY9FK,"it works fine without a train track, as well."
RX8FU73QMY9FK,they enjoyed playing with these chuggington trains and asked if i can get more for them.
RX8FU73QMY9FK,its a great toy if they want more of it!
RX8FU73QMY9FK,i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
R1XHQW6C9HBMMR,very cute plastic penguin.
R1XHQW6C9HBMMR,excellent quality.
R1XHQW6C9HBMMR,my daughter can t get enough of these animals.
R17M6Y35NTBAIK,"my son loves to swing, but i noticed a crack forming from the seat drain hole only a month or two after id bought it."
R17M6Y35NTBAIK,the crack has now extended up pretty far and so i will be looking for a swing by a different manufacturer as this one seems to have a quality control issue.
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,i received this cool baker free to review as part of a bzzagent campaign.
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,"my two girls, ages 6 and 8, could not wait to receive this cool baker in the mail."
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,it was very easy for my 8 year old to put together by herself.
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,"it does not come with chocolate, but luckily i had a couple different kinds on hand."
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,the instructions have you fill a three sectioned container with hot tap water in order to melt the chocolate.
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,"i was skeptical this would work, however, it melted the chocolate very easily."
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,"the only problem with this is that the sections are pretty small, so there is very little melted chocolate to work with at one time."
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,"we were, however, able to make 13 pieces of chocolate candy, depending on the molding size chosen, each time."
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,this kit also comes with little gift bags and tags to put your creations in.
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,i thought this was a great addition to the set.
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,my girls have used this baking set several times and loved it!!
R7VK8QOHDI6TD,"i thought the plastic parts were a little flimsy, but for the price i think it is a great gift for those little bakers in your life."
RBIOCOEQVUBIH,its a good card for a defenderwall deck
R2HCLLASIJVYL0,love this game!
R2HCLLASIJVYL0,its a classic with enough to keep you entertained but not so heavy that new gamers cant play
R395FX4M2PR984,i ordered these for my 3 year old sons birthday party as party favors.
R395FX4M2PR984,they were a huge hit & the perfect fit for a 3 year old!
R2L5SP8NGBLZJY,this is a very cute tool set.
R2L5SP8NGBLZJY,my son was so excited when he saw it he especially loves the belt.
R2L5SP8NGBLZJY,it makes him feel just like daddy and he loves to walk around the house fixing things.
R2L5SP8NGBLZJY,i definitely recommend it for any child who likes tools!
R2S5D4IZDDWIU2,my granddaughter loves this.
REK5GZRPM73WH,product didnt include the grandma.... very disappointing.
R43T3IKJF5BXG,"my daughter ordered this figure and was happy to see that is was authentic, its in great condition and a great addition to her collection."
R43T3IKJF5BXG,for an exclusive and authentic figma the price was amazing and almost unbelievable.
R3LF369D8JSF8Y,if i could give less than 1 star i would.
R3LF369D8JSF8Y,my son got this mower yesterday and bubbles will not come out unless you are on carpet or grass.
R3LF369D8JSF8Y,it doesnt get enough traction on hard floors and what bubbles you get isnt much
RBWRDLMG6C3TH,bought two.
RBWRDLMG6C3TH,havent even opened the second one as the first has held up for two summers at the lake stored away in winter with tons of kids using it.
RBWRDLMG6C3TH,"holds air, fits two adults comfortably or three kids."
RBWRDLMG6C3TH,"would give it five stars, but no beer holder!"
R2DYRFLEK2SOLP,great details!
R2WIYRWLD7LN3T,my son received this as a gift.
R2WIYRWLD7LN3T,"it has the potential of being a five star product, however, one of the plastic pieces arrived broken and defective so it couldnt connect the top of the structure to the bottom."
R2WIYRWLD7LN3T,we ended up gluing it together.
R2WIYRWLD7LN3T,the light box was pretty cool for the first 15 minutes it lasted.
R2WIYRWLD7LN3T,it broke almost instantly and would no longer light up.
R2WIYRWLD7LN3T,so the concept iwas pretty neat.
R2WIYRWLD7LN3T,"it was the first 3d puzzle we ever received and we will certainly buy more, however we do not recommend this product."
R2EUTCDKD0EMOO,this is a cute helmet for younger boys.
R2EUTCDKD0EMOO,"my 2 yr old grandson has not put it on yet, but im hoping he will before long."
RR2J3WP8O5OTP,got this as a present for my mom who loves otters.
RR2J3WP8O5OTP,"it is cute, soft, and seems to be sturdily made."
RR2J3WP8O5OTP,my mom loves him and named him oscar!
RR2J3WP8O5OTP,lol my only complaint is that his mouth is turned downward so his facial expression isnt very happy.
RR2J3WP8O5OTP,he looks like hes frowning so it makes him a little less cute.
RR2J3WP8O5OTP,otherwise good buy.
R2UCOIDCHUT1N5,"in a crash the props still pop off, instead of snapping a blade."
R2UCOIDCHUT1N5,"the guards eat a bit of batt., but not much notable difference."
R2UCOIDCHUT1N5,"i will say if nothing else, it provides a smoother flight, rather than the wild spasms."
R2UCOIDCHUT1N5,honestly just buy a pack of props instead.
R2UCOIDCHUT1N5,the quad itself is tough enough.
R23EAYQB3L34WX,"great price, fast delivery, happy grandson"
R2SLYNAUOSLK0N,"my niece will love it, but honestly this could be at the dollar store kinda quality.a little overpriced."
R1CKWV0N4MORS,this thing is pretty awesome a lot cheaper then buying it from the store and no its not a toy dont build and play with it you just put it up and look at it...sometimes ill take it down and just play with it and go pew pew pew but thats about it...its not a toy...
RAIS3M6N9FA2G,"it works great, but be prepared to peel a little after a week or two, as it burns a bit, but does the job."
RJ39CGDXPRYLW,"i think this game is a little young for the age description, but its amazing at teaching children about taking turns, and how to play a game like a good sport.its amazing how much my daughter loves this game and how minimal it actually is."
RJ39CGDXPRYLW,definitely would repurchase if the game itself were to deteriorate.
RQ3F58AHDRLOZ,it is as cute and easy to install.
R8N05H38DTZBG,my 4 yr old granddaughters love it vant get enought of playing princesses.
R8N05H38DTZBG,for now the horse and buggy are not connected.
R8N05H38DTZBG,"the ""straps""do not stay connected."
R8N05H38DTZBG,"we have put them away so the wont get lost, until the girls are a little older."
R8N05H38DTZBG,they dont seem to mind.
R31K04J8SSS2U9,had to return because the 1 balloon looks phallic.
R31K04J8SSS2U9,"more appropriate for a bachlorette party, not a one year olds birthday."

R158ZV3QPNCZ4P,great

R18DS3C73O3DJE,this train was super easy to put together and very educational.
R18DS3C73O3DJE,my son loved every second from start to finish and has played with it daily since it came  i will include the awesome video experience!
R18DS3C73O3DJE,i did get this at a discount to give my honest review and out of the mouth of my son he says it deserves 6 stars!!
R18DS3C73O3DJE,!

R1Y6UFKQ0SBLY1,awesome
R2WYJ7TT1HIO39,its good for the price.. just weird on how it connects to the bed with the straps.
R2WYJ7TT1HIO39,can easily come off.
R18V1UMP6GS8J3,poor quality.
R18V1UMP6GS8J3,toys fell apart and there is no way to put them back together.
R18V1UMP6GS8J3,the heads fell off!
R18V1UMP6GS8J3,seems like it could be a choking hazard for sure.
R22V0W8GBFERS2,my lo loves them!!!

R34K59XKUZVDWH,"also, the plastic brush holder falls out of the book well before the books life is over."
R34K59XKUZVDWH,so i end up digging through my purse for the brush or losing it.
R34K59XKUZVDWH,"wish theyd make that pet a bit sturdier.overall, i love these and highly recommend!"
R254MN3TL0GHM1,love the price of this compared to the takara versions.
R254MN3TL0GHM1,only problem was that the guns of frenzy are loose when but into his back but all you need to do is add some future shine to it and you have some great figs for less then half the price of the originals!
R7U7Q2CWK9RU6,my grandson loved his daniel tiger outfit and put it on immediately.
R7U7Q2CWK9RU6,a little long and baggy on a 4 year old but is probably perfect for a 5 year old or small 6 year old.
R24CYYQ6E83QB8,"way over priced for what you get, $2.00 is more like it."
R24CYYQ6E83QB8,too much trouble to return.
R24CYYQ6E83QB8,some have broken off sections while others are warped.
R24CYYQ6E83QB8,"they are not giant, just regular size."
R24CYYQ6E83QB8,buy some better product if you can find one.
R2VGIZ5YURRFL4,"cute toy that teaches shapes, colors, numbers and coordination."
R2VGIZ5YURRFL4,"i took away a star because i used to equate the melissa & doug brand with high quality, safe toys, but the quality of this toy is soso."
R2VGIZ5YURRFL4,"although the pieces dont seem like theyll fall apart, they feel flimsy and arent well made."
R2VGIZ5YURRFL4,it also wouldve been nice if the shapes had a rattle or crinkly paper in them to add another dimension of play the handle of the fishing rod has a cheap squeaker in it.
R2VGIZ5YURRFL4,"however, for the price point, its fine."
R2VGIZ5YURRFL4,"fyi, my 10 month old prefers the lamaze fish bowl over this one."
R2KJSYHPSSAT7M,"the wild west galloping horse from lord howard was a hit with my nephew!it came simply packaged, which meant it was easy for a 3 year old to rip into.it had very good instructions on the back as to how to &34train&34 your horse.it also came with a battery so there was no having to wait to play!the horse and cowboy unit are both well made."
R2KJSYHPSSAT7M,we did have some trouble getting the training wheel to work.
R2KJSYHPSSAT7M,the suction cup wouldnt stick to much.
R2KJSYHPSSAT7M,"that was okay though because just watching the horse gallop was plenty enough fun for us.the horse makes a very realistic &34clomp, clomp&34 sound when it walks."
R2KJSYHPSSAT7M,"it pretty much turns in one giant circle, so i think that it would be quite difficult to have an actual race with two horses."
R2KJSYHPSSAT7M,"my nephew loved saying, &34its gonna crash!&34we truly had a ball watching this horse run."
R2KJSYHPSSAT7M,i received this product at a discount for my honest review.
R18JQAUIKPRWVC,i opened and got this keldeo ex card from a bw boundaries crossed booster pack.
R18JQAUIKPRWVC,i was so glad to get this card because keldeo is one of my favorite water type pok&eacutemon and one of my favorite gen 5 pok&eacutemon.
R18JQAUIKPRWVC,"the legendary trasures and boundaries crossed keldeo ex card are the same card, but just a different set.the drawing of keldeo on this card is spectacular and beautiful, and the pok&eacutemon ex cards are famous for their rarity and beautiful card art."
R18JQAUIKPRWVC,"its attacks arent all that great, but this card is worth finding and getting!"
RSMU870VAOQWU,the items arrived after the event for which i ordered them.
RSMU870VAOQWU,they were extremely small photo props which i never have nor ever will use.
RSMU870VAOQWU,"the only items which i got any use from were the dowel rodswooden sticks, which i used for another decoration i created."
RSMU870VAOQWU,i was very disappointed in this item purchased.
RLZ3KT1XVD9RO,good and cute
R1OTKD0KWH5P4X,beautiful doll.
R1OTKD0KWH5P4X,my daughter loves it and plays with it often.
R3CWPLW0Z34W6O,sadly very disappointed.
R3CWPLW0Z34W6O,the box that it was shipped in wasnt sealed.
R3CWPLW0Z34W6O,it looked like it had been opened.
R3CWPLW0Z34W6O,the tassel was a giant mess and the kettle part was broken.
R3CWPLW0Z34W6O,"also, it does not hold 16oz."
R3CWPLW0Z34W6O,so whoever said you can get 3 cups out of it flat out lied.
R3CWPLW0Z34W6O,the decorative box was also damaged.
R3CWPLW0Z34W6O,i do not recommend this product.
RP7FZC3RMCVA9,fun

R3BWS74RG4WMHS,this was everything he expected!
R180CBAE03DQFH,"loved this booster pack, i just had to pay more than i wanted to"
R21L66CGLGLK4X,this is was my new favorite toy.
R21L66CGLGLK4X,very stable and powerful.
R21L66CGLGLK4X,but... two power failures have caused it to fall from the sky before battery was exhausted.
R21L66CGLGLK4X,"the last one happened 25 above asphalt, after only 4 minutes of flying."
R21L66CGLGLK4X,i need to order a new body and landing gear.
R21L66CGLGLK4X,then figure out how to completely rebuild it.
R3HYNKELC3QJ63,it is way too small for my two year old toddler.
R3HYNKELC3QJ63,sometimes the balls stick when she is driving the toy around the house.
R7VBMBM9721K9,its a great deck box.... a bit larger than the competion plus it has a nice divider for the side deck.
RWR3M6VBFK6JW,my son loves it.
RWR3M6VBFK6JW,i can actually get him to get out of the car seat now lol .
RWR3M6VBFK6JW,he used to want to sit and play with the buckles .
RWR3M6VBFK6JW,now i just show him this and he is out

R1QGOPLPDBQS41,if i had not promised them to him i would have kept them for myself!
R1QGOPLPDBQS41,!
R2JYQW4JK54GYL,it worked for a day and a half then started making all kinds of weird noises and wouldnt move properly.
R2JYQW4JK54GYL,once they have sat for a long time the originals have issues with the springs in the base.
R2JYQW4JK54GYL,my boyfriend took it apart and fixed it three times.
R2JYQW4JK54GYL,i finally threw it out and got them a newer one.
R2JYQW4JK54GYL,the new ones make a homer simpson sounding voice sometimes though so it may scare kids if they arent expecting it at least thats what happened with mine.
R290KMSMJXFURO,i have been fascinated with fitness trackers since they started becoming popular and im fortunate to say that ive been able to try many of them in the market.
R290KMSMJXFURO,"and today, im happy to bring you a review of a rather unique one from oregon scientific.its very simply called the ""activity tracker"" and its got a lot of the same features that other fitness wearables do."
R290KMSMJXFURO,"so, i will just start with the basics."
R290KMSMJXFURO,the activity tracker from oregon scientific comes in either pink or black rubber bands.
R290KMSMJXFURO,it will track your movement through internal sensors and will analyze your sleeping wellness based off of how much you move during your sleep cycles.
R290KMSMJXFURO,these are pretty standard options with fitness wearables.
R290KMSMJXFURO,what is special about this activity tracker is that it will also track your heart rate and send notifications from your phone to your wrist.
R290KMSMJXFURO,this function is typically something you only see on more advanced wearables and smart watches.my first impressions of this device were generally good.
R290KMSMJXFURO,it was comfortable and connected easily with my iphone.
R290KMSMJXFURO,"it does require an app for connection, but thats true of most fitness wearables."
R290KMSMJXFURO,one thing i noticed right away was the digital display.
R290KMSMJXFURO,a display is one of my must haves with fitness wearables.
R290KMSMJXFURO,this one shows activity and notifications.
R290KMSMJXFURO,"plus it measures steps, calories burned, distance traveled, active minutes, inactive minutes and actual sleep time.unfortunately, i had some issues with the activity tracker functioning properly 100 of the time i was testing it."
R290KMSMJXFURO,"first of all, the battery seemed to drain unfashionably fast."
R290KMSMJXFURO,the specs state that you should charge it at least once per week.
R290KMSMJXFURO,i had to charge mine once a day.
R290KMSMJXFURO,"also, the activity tracker is rated as water resistant up to 1 meter and its protected against accidental splashes, but i washed my hands at one point while i was testing it and after i dried it off, the tracker locked up and wouldnt reset until the battery completely drained and i recharged it.based off of my experiences with oregon scientifics products, i believe that my activity tracker may have been defective, but i felt that i needed to note these issues.i did really enjoy the ios app interface."
R290KMSMJXFURO,it was very easy to read and the tracker synced flawlessly with my phone whenever the app was opened.
R290KMSMJXFURO,it has very easy to read icons and a progress ataglance view.
R290KMSMJXFURO,one thing i would have liked to see was an easier way to enter sleep mode.
R290KMSMJXFURO,"in order to enter sleep mode on this tracker, you have to open the app."
R290KMSMJXFURO,"there are many trackers that have similar option, but only require that you tap a button on the device to enable it."
R290KMSMJXFURO,id love to see this option incorporated into future versions of this tracker.you get a lot with this feature packed wearable.
R290KMSMJXFURO,"for a fraction of the cost of some of the fitness bands out there, you can do a lot more.&34this product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review."
R290KMSMJXFURO,i am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews.
R290KMSMJXFURO,"please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&34completely drained and i recharged it.based off of my experiences with oregon scientifics products, i believe that my activity tracker may have been defective, but i felt that i needed to note these issues.i did really enjoy the ios app interface."

R3IDRLEQQUYIAK,"my granddaughter loves everything ""flash"" and loves the costume."
R3IDRLEQQUYIAK,it fits perfectly and she wears a size 5.
RMPP1VO7GNJ8,excellent
R2VFHM1DRJ0SGT,its not bad but not that high quality it came all folded up and isnt its regular shape but its still cool
R1LK5791WL7BJ6,"great product,amazing price!"
R6S18OZG4SNQK,we go over these everyday and my kids are able to say a lot of these when asked.
R3GG51DX57GBOB,"overall, we loved this product."
R3GG51DX57GBOB,"both of my children boy, age 8 and girl, age 6 have lots of fun playing with these."
R3GG51DX57GBOB,it would be more fun if the robots moved forward and backward.
R3GG51DX57GBOB,"one of the arms on one of the robots is squeaky according to 8. also, one of the body stickers was not affixed well."
R3GG51DX57GBOB,i received this for free from bzzagent.
R3GG51DX57GBOB,i dont know that id pay $50 for it...
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,this is a great racing game that is super easy for little kids.
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,we have a wii u and my older kids play mariokart and the little kids are sad they cant play as well.
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,"once we got this game, they felt like they could do it and do it well!"
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,"this game is for slightly younger kids, so we were hoping this would work well for my 3 year old."
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,"she still struggles to learn her letters and numbers, but i think these games are something that she will grow into and will reinforce concepts she learns at preschool which she starts in a few weeks."
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,this game was really easy and she played it fairly well.
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,"you race the car on a track, avoiding obstacles and trying to collect golden tires."
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,there are various questions that you have to answer that have to do with physics.
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,"the words they use are a little advanced but once they play it several times, they get use to it."
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,hopefully this will actually help them build vocabulary for when they learn physical science concepts in school.
R2N4SZW9CMFHUD,overall a very fun game!
RF6KLW6KM4AZ5,"excellent kit with current configuration, as near as i can tell!"
R27VQOS1LECA5I,crook !!
R27VQOS1LECA5I,"!do not buy from him, before pretending to make nice then blocks the email, you can not contact him, steals money !!"
R27VQOS1LECA5I,"i will have my money back of course, but youre just a worm revolting!"
R27VQOS1LECA5I,know this!
R3ETJQ5QPYTF83,we love playing this game with our daughter!
R18SBV8ALZ9QBN,i cannot believe it is this big of a box with so few legos.
R18SBV8ALZ9QBN,it barely covers the bottom of the box.
R18SBV8ALZ9QBN,"great product and great quality, but for $80 i expect a whole lot more."
R18SBV8ALZ9QBN,"if it cost only $20 i would have been find with it, but $80????"
R18SBV8ALZ9QBN,really disappointed because this was for the students in my classroom.
R18SBV8ALZ9QBN,there is enough legos for maybe 2 kids to play with them and believe me there are a whole lot more than just 2 kids in my classroom that want to play with them.
RQWQAGEPJ0APR,great!
RQWQAGEPJ0APR,thanks so much and god bless!
R33HX18BNAC5LR,"looks like the original, very nice and arrived on time or early."
R1ZNW2OMBO9HE5,my 3year old granddaughter loves this!
R1G2R6FYIMBGZH,"i had the chance to try this out, as an expecting father this toy promises to help with motor skills, learning the alphabet and just being fun."
R1G2R6FYIMBGZH,it comes with a school buss and letters and you put the letters in the little spot and each letter causes different things to happen.
R1G2R6FYIMBGZH,"the bus makes a lot of fun noises and is really fun to play with, i say that as a 35 year old guy, i am sure my kid will love this."
R1G2R6FYIMBGZH,"overall i would recommend this, great quality, lots of ""little"" pieces as each letter is separate so you want to watch closely but in the end i really do like it."
R25IWW20MPS0XI,i bought these with the snow sparkle princess dress clothes.
R25IWW20MPS0XI,they are pretty and fit my daughters american girl perfectly.
R25IWW20MPS0XI,shipping was fast and item was exactly as shown.
R2SBS5BLARAF06,the dress was exactly as shown and made very well.
R2SBS5BLARAF06,it fit perfectly...
R1RPO8GTWUKROI,"we gave this to our 3 year old, and he is doing great with it."
R1RPO8GTWUKROI,he loves being able to chose which character he is going to play as.
R1RPO8GTWUKROI,"the interactive nature of the game asking for the child to find a letter card, and then have the child photograph it, is a really engaging platform."
R1RPO8GTWUKROI,"since he is only 3 i find it helpful to lay all the cards out for him in alphabetical order, instead of into several color coded piles as designed."
R1RPO8GTWUKROI,"after guiding him through the first time, he is able to play it independently."
R1RPO8GTWUKROI,the cards come in a tin storage case.
R3FC07PHOUI9DB,the quality of these plastic animals is wonderful.
R3QCHH7L95AAI9,my daughter loved this chair and i think it is highquality.
R3QCHH7L95AAI9,it also looks cute and there was no assembly which i like.
R3QCHH7L95AAI9,the chair also comes with its own bag.
R2DBIHS70R7HUP,nice
R2RZOY9FX7JGM9,these balloons worked great.
R2RZOY9FX7JGM9,we used them for a water balloon toss at a party and filled a few hundred the morning of the party.
R2RZOY9FX7JGM9,we used a pump designed for filling water balloons because that always works better than the faucet and its more fun.
R2RZOY9FX7JGM9,enjoy!
R2NCBXC29IJRLF,we started our lego collection with this set.
R2NCBXC29IJRLF,it is large enough for each of our four older kids to have something to build.
R2NCBXC29IJRLF,there are a variety of potential configurations and options.
R2NCBXC29IJRLF,it was exactly the price range and number of blocks we were looking for.
R1W0FSF9621TXO,nice

RG8K1S4FQ4ZM4,in time for my boys birthday.
RG8K1S4FQ4ZM4,i love it.
R37U059L32AGS0,"purchased these a couple weeks ago for my 6 12 year old son, and he loves them."
R37U059L32AGS0,most toys get played with for a few minutes to an hour and then start collecting dust.
R37U059L32AGS0,"so far he is playing with these every day, usually for well over an hour."
R37U059L32AGS0,"he is having a lot of fun building all the items in the handout that comes with the set, as well as designing his own structures."
R37U059L32AGS0,"with legos and other building toys he get very invested in keeping the items built intact and doesnt want to take apart and reuse the parts, with the magformers he enjoys finding new ways to destroy the build and then see how fast he can recreate.great toy, will definitely get some more down the road."
RLPRF09XFN73H,just what i expected
R2FDUKE7O2GK1R,this is a great game

R4CYAP50XKGNE,easy to handle and not flimsy seller was perfect in description price and delivery
R3BEQPQYOD0Q1U,this is one of those different types of toys your kids will enjoy...whether using the app or not.
R3BEQPQYOD0Q1U,my kids never heard of or seen these before but were instantly intrigued.
R3BEQPQYOD0Q1U,i delayed use the app for a day just so the quicktoboredom factor was delayed.
R3BEQPQYOD0Q1U,it added fun note having their own ipad was key factor and a lot giggles.price is good but i would still wait to get it when it goes under $15.
R1RRTJIMKB6EO9,this toy is great!
R1RRTJIMKB6EO9,the expected delivery time was in 1 to 2 months but came within 2 weeks of the order!
R1RRTJIMKB6EO9,"i am very satisfied with this product, the only thing i do not like about it is the hood fits kinda weird on the black haired one, but i just cut it off and now looks fine."
R1RRTJIMKB6EO9,they are about 3.75 inches and each have a silver lightsaber blade is removable but stays in pretty well.
R1RRTJIMKB6EO9,the body is very articulate and the molding is amazing!
R1RRTJIMKB6EO9,overall great product!

RIPGWVUVVWA4J,for 5 dollars this is a huge score.
RIPGWVUVVWA4J,lots of very detailed characters.
RIPGWVUVVWA4J,yeah you have to assemble them but thats easy.
RIPGWVUVVWA4J,not sure why another viewer found it difficult unless you have arthritis or something.
RIPGWVUVVWA4J,usually one lego person is $4 on its own.
RIPGWVUVVWA4J,i was missing a leg and a head so i just combined what i had.
RIPGWVUVVWA4J,19 people for 5 bucks is still a steal.
R16Z86Z7WFAK12,"we had lots of fun with this game, although not everyone has the mind to play it."
RLF4H5XUDOAZ6,it was a great deal
RZ7LHL33ZTNG0,"great game, but ours came without the decoder."
R1RSUP0W834H44,"if you like tacocats, goats, explosions, regular cats, cards, laughing, family time, rainbows, saying ""nope!"
R1RSUP0W834H44,""", etc... this is the game for you!"
R2KR8DG80A8I0L,its cute.
R2KR8DG80A8I0L,a little small for the cost but still acceptable.
R2JLD9MKXCTAGL,daughter wanted to play with but batteries were dead.
R2JLD9MKXCTAGL,i feel that if you buy something it should not come with dead batteries therefore making kid sad that she cannot play with.
R2R0BTQP49CM88,this figure is awesome.
R2R0BTQP49CM88,the detail and just about everything else is amazing.
R2R0BTQP49CM88,the seller toynk toys were great to work with as well.

R2M4860TG3DX08,one of the ears s clips were backwards.
R2M4860TG3DX08,"theyre really soft if thats what you wanted, but they dont stay as triangles for the cat like look."

R1ZPE6IS3OBEDD,lasted great were the perfect size would buy again!
R1SYJDYAODLAUI,the aircraft engineer kit is ideal for a 57 year old child.
R1SYJDYAODLAUI,out biggest problem has been to stretch out what there is in the box  there is a lot to play with.
R1SYJDYAODLAUI,this is a great problem to have.the storybook is a good touch.
R1SYJDYAODLAUI,"if you follow along with this and youll probably have to guide your child, youll be assembling the kit as you go."
R1SYJDYAODLAUI,it can take some time.
R1SYJDYAODLAUI,what i like best about this product is the fact that even nonreading children can use the instructions in the story to build the model.
R1SYJDYAODLAUI,"while the story may be somewhat tedious for grown ups, this is nothing new.the only concern ive got is that the price is a little high."
R1SYJDYAODLAUI,great toy!
R4AKCCA5XQ6TT,"great cube, easy to turn, great value."
RLT693DMVYMPC,"i bought this for new baby ""jack,"" son of my friends."
RLT693DMVYMPC,every child should have a jackinthebox.
RLT693DMVYMPC,theres something really funny about watching a childs surprise and wonder when the clown pops up.
RLT693DMVYMPC,its a childs first exposure to magic.
RLT693DMVYMPC,the little jack comes from no where in their eyes.
R3THI4U59JV3S9,good
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,this is fantastic!
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,its been a huge hit this summer.
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,its perfect for someone who wants a bouncy house and a water slide but doesnt want to take up a lot of space or put in a crazy amount of effort to store the thing.
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,we actually leave it out on our lawn now and well put it away at the end of the summer.
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,but its very easy to fold up and put away.
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,"im 411 and i can put it away by myself without any help, once its dry."
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,just let it dry for a few hours or even overnight and then put it away in a giant plastic bin from lowes or home depot.
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,we put it on grass so didnt bother with a tarp underneath it and no pops or tears.
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,3 kids can jump comfortable in the bouncy part.
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,"ive had 2 sitting at the top of the slide, no problem and about 5 or 6 kids hanging out in the pool area."
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,so you can really have about 10 kids playing on this thing at once.
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,its the best!!
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,"and when not using the water on the slide, its still fun to use as a dry slide and bouncy so its perfect all year round!"
R3RB7Z0KRWD07O,i can even fit this in my basement in the winter months!

R29ES6CQEGTRM5,frozen wasnt one of our favorites.
R29ES6CQEGTRM5,not sure if its the game or that my boys havent really gotten into the frozen movie.
R29ES6CQEGTRM5,the game can be played in single or two player mode.
R29ES6CQEGTRM5,"while it does provide fun, my boys arent quick to pick it up."
R29ES6CQEGTRM5,the game is a tad on the short side and the difficulty levels arent adjustable.

R16DCJT7DKUTW8,"this was a impulse buy and money wasted its basically a piece of junk, dont waste your money buy a couple of lottery tickets instead.edit 101615 to clarify my review.very simply this is not a good product its very hard to mount to a smartphone, i also worried about scratching or damaging a very expensive phone with this, and once on it doesnt work well at all, i use the smart tools app on android it does the same function and does it in a superior way no attachments needed and no risk of damage to your phone.so yes save your money and buy lottery tickets or anything other than this"

R2MSET9E8F0DL0,i received a very nice set of morphun junior blocks.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,it came in a nice sturdy casetub container so i didnt have to buy one!
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,"it came in a set with 300 different pieces that included some square, triangle, wheels, and other pieces."
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,it had about 7 different colors.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,"it also included 5 double sided sheets of instructions for different patterns to build animals, people, cars, etc.. my son turned 4 in may so i got them out for us to build with."
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,i started with the hardest pattern to try one of the bulldozers.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,it took me a second to figure out how to get the pieces linked together.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,it took my son a few tries to figure it out.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,he still has some trouble.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,the box recommends it is for children ages 3. i dont know that he could have done it age 3. he still cant follow the pattern yet.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,i did help him with getting the pieces lined right and he was able to push them down.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,i believe in time he will be able to do some of the easier patterns.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,overall they are great blocks.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,he enjoyed just putting them together and making his own creation.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,i would recommend them for any kids that like to build and out things together.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,i did notice that sone patterns call for x number of pieces in a certain shape.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,i wasnt able to find enough in the same color so we had to mix some of the colors.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,you can see it in some of my pictures.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,it doesnt really bother me but did make it a ltitle harder for my son when he tried to match the colors in the picture.
R2MSET9E8F0DL0,i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

R3Q9DP0JEQXET3,"the only backpack my picky son wanted and i found it here, thankfully."
R3Q9DP0JEQXET3,i was nervous about the quality but its perfect.
R3Q9DP0JEQXET3,"comes with 3 pockets, one in the pack may be best for a laptop."
R3Q9DP0JEQXET3,the front zipper is the smallest section but has many little pockets inside.
R3Q9DP0JEQXET3,the only thing i would have to say that bugs me is the arm straps are so stiff but it doesnt bother my son so its okay
R1I0G7JAZT8FTS,turned out to be the perfect touch for my sons painting birthday party.

R37Y4Q4HSW8MD6,i was a little worried when getting this game that it would be too hard for my 3 year old who loves frozen.
R37Y4Q4HSW8MD6,but it wasnt too badshe is not very familiar with her letters and numbers but she can tell that a letter is a letter and a number is a number.
R37Y4Q4HSW8MD6,"i played this with her and she loved the different games, and that you just answer a few questions and then get to play."
R37Y4Q4HSW8MD6,we especially loved the sledding with olaf and jewelry making.
R37Y4Q4HSW8MD6,"its also nice that some of the games are body interactive, to get your child moving but its also easier for the little ones to do than using the controller but sometimes they motion is a little too sensitive and causes them to get an answer wrong unnessarily."
R37Y4Q4HSW8MD6,this game also seemed slightly similar to disney princesses.
R37Y4Q4HSW8MD6,but it is really fun and perfect for all frozen lovers!
R1P66L1GGWA8FD,this held up well at our family reunion.
R1P66L1GGWA8FD,the kids were playing with it as well
R3M0DBQGVB63KD,i bought this wagon for almost 12 grand and i was extremely disappointed.
R3M0DBQGVB63KD,it was just a kids red wagon!
R3M0DBQGVB63KD,for that price i expected it to have jet propulsion or a time machine or a least a dvd player!!!
R3M0DBQGVB63KD,"that is that last time i spend a penny over 10,000.00 for a wagon."

RV8CFFA5PPWIZ,also makes a great gift.
R3IAHQOYN27V4Z,my boys absolutely love this game.
R3IAHQOYN27V4Z,"they received it as a gift when they were 4 and a year later, its still one of their favorite games."
R3IAHQOYN27V4Z,its a pain to put the ice back in after they play and its too difficult for small kids to do on their own.
R3IAHQOYN27V4Z,"but, its an easy game for small kids to play."
R3H4LN3ZSBWPW6,makes lego kits a lot more fun.

R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"last year i had a different type of plane, a ""revell control fireshot."""
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"i had my 2.5yearold daughter trying to fly it, which resulted in several crashes."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,finally i took the control away from her and promptly got the plane stuck high up in a large spruce tree.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,i believe it later blew out of the tree during a storm but went into a huge swampy area of shoulderhigh crabgrass.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,it was a real bummer.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,anyway i was glad to get this plane as a replacement.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"it is in about the same class as far as weight, power, and price, but has the interesting vertical takeoff feature."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,i find that the vertical takeoff and inflight switchover work just as claimed.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"i prefer this function over the socalled ""multiterrain"" feature of the revell, which was almost entirely advertising hype."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"like the revell, this air hogs model is totally helpless in even the slightest wind."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,typically i find the plane is pointed back towards me yet keeps getting farther and farther away as it loses its fight against the breeze.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,i guess i cant expect any better from anything this small and light.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"if the wind blows it too far away, or too close to large buildings, or if it just climbs up too high to see clearly, i simply cut the throttle completely and it comes spiraling down."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"then about 25 feet from impact i give it full power again and it pulls out of the dive, having reverted to helicopter mode automatically."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"battery life in the air seems acceptable, enough to get into trouble several times."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,honestly the plane does not fly very fast and would probably get boring pretty soon if it did not get into some trouble.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"this plane charges off the remote control unit, which uses 4 aa batteries."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"using eneloop nimh rechargeables, i found the plane charges up from dead out in about 35 minutes."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"maybe it might charge a bit faster if you used the alkaline batteries the instructions recommend, as those have somewhat higher voltage."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,a little touch i really like is that the battery compartment in the controlcharger doesnot need a screwdriver to open.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"there is a little button you can push in with the pointed bullet of a rifle cartridge, or with a pen point if you happen to have a pen."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,the only thing i dislike about this plane is it seems to be very fragile.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"the wing appears pretty fragile, but i found with my revell that this black material that looks like styrofoam is actually many times tougher than styrofoam would be, so i think now the wing is not the weakest part."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,it is the propellers that scare me most.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,the propeller shafts are extremely long and thin.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"there is some odd mechanism mounted to each propeller, almost like a variable pitch mechanism, which has some really tiny linkage parts."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"the propellers are also very exposed, and would hit the ground hard if you tried to land the plane without using the hover mode."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,there are also some exposed electrical wires that look pretty delicate.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"all i can say is, i think i will not be letting my daughter control this one."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"as another reviewer wrote, 14 years old would be a good age for flying this."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,maybe 10 at the youngest.
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"id take away more stars for this issue, except i did crash the plane a few times now and so far it did not break."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,"under calm conditions this plane is great fun, and quite amazing in its function."
R1NS1YDJ8Y4LBX,i would just caution against putting $50 into this if the intended pilot is not a very mature and careful person.
R370IYYV5THK99,poor quality.the pictures are pealing off the cubes.
R370IYYV5THK99,have not even used it!cute size for little hands though.

RZC2EU495OPDS,the package did not come with all of the pieces listed in the product info.
RZC2EU495OPDS,i did not receive a charge cord or the extra blades.

RGX74Q0XVJY1Q,exceeded my expectations.
RAYGDXDVH1SY8,"if youve sat through the credits of the original &quotcars&quot movie, then youll recall the funny scene that ran while they were rolling in which radiator springs residents are watching carrelated spoofs of popular disneypixar films at the radiator springs drivein theatre toy car story based on &quottoy story&quot, monster trucks inc. based on &quotmonsters inc.&quot, and this one based on 1998s &quota bugs life&quot."
RAYGDXDVH1SY8,"in the short clip, it briefly shows all of the nonspeaking clown cars that are being released as 2015 super chase models circus cab, circus van, circus sedan, circus pickup, and circus forklift &amp circus gt, along with &quota bugs life&quot character p.t."
RAYGDXDVH1SY8,"flea designed as a &quotnimbly co. noseeum lx&quot, and &quota bugs life&quot protagonist flik designed as a &quotspecial aphid gt&quot."
RAYGDXDVH1SY8,"there was a mattel &quotmovie moments&quot 2 pack with those two characters released years ago... now heres the rest of the group!we really like the looks of this glossy white sedan, splattered with dirt and an orange matte finish roof  his wide front tapers on the sides to a slimmer back end."
RAYGDXDVH1SY8,"just as with all of mattel 155 scale models weve collected for our grandsons, these are amazingly durable little cars that have withstood more races and crashes than i can count in our home over the years!"
RAYGDXDVH1SY8,"mattel came out with a super chase line of &quotcars&quot years ago, &quotsuper&quot chase, we assume, because theyre super rare  production limited to no more than 4000 worldwide."
RAYGDXDVH1SY8,"wed already rounded up the previous ones for our older grandson 2011s frosty, flash long ge, memo rojas &amp russian racer vitaly petrov, 2012s hiroaki, takeshi &amp yukio, and 2014s &quot95&quot fans luigi &amp guido, &quotciao&quot francesco bernoulli, trike feldman, and carateka, and well be collecting all of these new super chase models for our middle grandson now.due to the limited production, they come with hefty price tags, so our purchasing strategy has been to do a lot of shoppingmonitoring of prices before opening our wallet."
RAYGDXDVH1SY8,"were keeping our fingers crossed that these will increase in value over the years, providing the grandkids with an option to either hang on to these collectors models for their own kids, or sell them for a lot more than were paying right now."
RAYGDXDVH1SY8,"2816  after a final check of amazons lowest price  $24.95  we were just able to pick one of these neat guys up on ebay for $17.95 with free shipping, so just be sure to shop around.to do a lot of shoppingmonitoring of prices before opening our wallet."

R37SVO76D384Q0,enough said.
R3SADPVWP7568V,nice gift for the os fan in your life
R184MO3Z9FIXPE,the lunch box is too small for an older elementary or middle school lunch.
R184MO3Z9FIXPE,"the sandwich compartment is fine for a bagged sandwich, but held neither a reusable sandwich container nor a divided vegetable and dip divided container."
R184MO3Z9FIXPE,the top section will hold either a drink box or a canned beverage but not a water bottle.
R184MO3Z9FIXPE,"it would be full with a drink, yogurt, napkin and eating utensils."
R3VP723M9018GM,it broke the moment i opened it.

R2DA3A6SEBY5PR,good price for this water table.
R2DA3A6SEBY5PR,not happy with the slide and water wheel parts as this is easily knocked over while their playing.
R2DA3A6SEBY5PR,other than that its sturdy and the kids seem to really likei it.
R3OP4SX6R7XV3H,very nice

RIMW8GRUBV70D,the bottom rips very easily on these and your baby will fall through!!!
RIMW8GRUBV70D,do not buy!!!
RIMW8GRUBV70D,this product was named one of the top 10 most dangerous toys!!!
RIMW8GRUBV70D,"the companies that make these just ignore the problems, rename their companies, and continue to sell this dangerous product!"
RIMW8GRUBV70D,ive seen this on several youtube videos and im absolutely horrified by their lack of morals and concern for their customers!
RIMW8GRUBV70D,please dont buy this dangerous toy!!
RIMW8GRUBV70D,!

RWCHH2XGV6GL0,bad material.
RWCHH2XGV6GL0,"buy one from a different user, theyre much better."
RKKDLTQJGQ765,really sturdy and durable raft.
RKKDLTQJGQ765,use the cup holder but use the ice chest to hold a waterproof bag with other things.
RKKDLTQJGQ765,hasnt faded over the summer

R1EDTBPFKTKH21,"this gun should be renamed ""darteater"" it jams constantly and shreds darts in the process!"
RQ31KY4VIQYMA,i bought these for an event hoping to bring water balloons to it.
RQ31KY4VIQYMA,"instructions should state the balloons are for ""immediate use only""."
RQ31KY4VIQYMA,only an hour or two after filling most of the balloons emptied.
RQ31KY4VIQYMA,the rubber ring which closes the balloon is simply not tight enough to keep water in the balloons for a significant period of time.
RQ31KY4VIQYMA,complete waste of money in my case.
RQ31KY4VIQYMA,probably fine for a neighborhood water balloon fight where you use the balloons right away.
R90TVNX5NSQJS,thank you
R2NP7W5BANUNYY,so cute kids love this
R2404ZLVOMFI43,cute activity!
R2404ZLVOMFI43,my two year old learned to cut with the activities.

RKWKVY9WOZC9H,"i have 2 daughters that love frozen, so this game was of course a hit."
RKWKVY9WOZC9H,they get a chance to play in the world of arendelle with their favorite characters.
RKWKVY9WOZC9H,the learning portion of the game adjusts to the ability of each of them easily through their different leap tv profiles  so they are able to enjoy the game together.
R2D8MOPGSCJB51,fun game
R7R79CDFQBLWR,small

R2JC7JI38DTSZN,my 5 year old daughter loved this backpack.
R2JC7JI38DTSZN,she keeps all of her disney princesses in it.
R2JC7JI38DTSZN,it also makes it easy for her to carry her dolls to mimis house.
R2JC7JI38DTSZN,"she has used it so much, its starting to rip a little."
R2JC7JI38DTSZN,not sure if its because she can be rough on toys or the durability of the product.
R2JC7JI38DTSZN,the velcro is starting to go as well.
R2S6Z7KOYL02B7,love the mint color and the details.very cute and fluffy!
R1YP6EBWE9WW59,"comfortable, tough, cheap cant beat it for the money."

R2ABXGB49YRUJZ,i bought this for my friends daughter who is really into frozen.
R2ABXGB49YRUJZ,i looked for this art kit everywhere including walmart.
R2ABXGB49YRUJZ,they do not carry it.
R2ABXGB49YRUJZ,the apron and arm sleeves are so adorable.
R2ABXGB49YRUJZ,the art sets are organized and comes with variety of colors for a fun art project.
R2ABXGB49YRUJZ,i gave this this to the daughter she loved it so much!
R2ABXGB49YRUJZ,i received this item at a discount rate in exchange for my honest review.
R2ABXGB49YRUJZ,i would definitely pay for this at full price considering the value of this kit.highly recommend for frozen little fans!

R1L2X594U774U,these balloons came in record time.
R1L2X594U774U,they were part of an activity with the grandchildren.
R1L2X594U774U,first they had a water balloon fight.
R1L2X594U774U,my 9 year old granddaughters filled the balloons.
R1L2X594U774U,"after the water fight, there were still balloons left."
R1L2X594U774U,"so they blew them up, stufffed them in their clothes and tried to break balloons by running into each other."
R1L2X594U774U,i will definitely buy these again.

R3AH0405XT2HT9,this is one of the best gunpla ive built so far.
R3AH0405XT2HT9,this is my 5th master grade and im in love with this kit.
R3AH0405XT2HT9,the gold actually looks good and posing with this kit is a dream!
R3AH0405XT2HT9,it can almost do any pose you want it to do.
R3AH0405XT2HT9,i guess the only negative i have to mention about this kit is that it doesnt have much accessories.
R3AH0405XT2HT9,"it has a rifle, a bazooka and 2 beam sabersthose sword handles look like lightsabers from starwars."
R3AH0405XT2HT9,i also would mention the gate placement.
R3AH0405XT2HT9,"its good for the most part but there are a few in the gold parts where the nubs are noticeable only if you look closely and since the gold parts are not entirely ""gold"", the nubs do show."
R3AH0405XT2HT9,the good outweight the bad as the mobile suit overall is a great kit.
R3AH0405XT2HT9,"awesome articulation, great proportions, and attention seeking aesthetics makes this kit a must buy!"
RDKVXDAJUNFYC,this backpack is so adorable!
RDKVXDAJUNFYC,its different and cuddly.
RDKVXDAJUNFYC,its washed well so far and weve had it almost 4 months.
R2YSA33GEBXAPQ,its a good card for a noncombat damage deck
R2RJFCTBXF1V8L,"if you like rummy andor quiddler youll love this game, which is a mix of the two."
R2RJFCTBXF1V8L,definitely recommended to those who enjoy a good card game.
RE7Z2GV7HOG04,great fun but when you attache the bubbles to the machine its easy to over twist and split the fish a little.
RE7Z2GV7HOG04,not a huge deal.
R28G1ZJB5H8RTR,arrived doa.
R16A21762FDBGZ,"first off the only reason i dont give this a 5 star is because its quite small for the price but the only reason its a bit pricy is because its a deadpool item, but other than that i like coming back home and putting my spare change into deadpools back so good buy regardless"
R2ZUZM3JDWK4QC,didnt fit properly right from the beginning.
R2ZUZM3JDWK4QC,the leads were too short to reach the block and had to be spliced right from the beginning.
R2ZUZM3JDWK4QC,waste of money in my opinion.
R2ZUZM3JDWK4QC,"we are in northern minnesota, doesnt get hot enough to really be necessary up here."
R2ZUZM3JDWK4QC,maybe okay in hotter climates.
R2ZUZM3JDWK4QC,"just goes to prove my theory ""stuff doesnt have to work, it just has to sell"""
RHCRTV3U5V2UP,bought this for my one year old nephew and he loves it!
R25F75YGUBULDL,"cool little toy except that the controller sticks and makes it nearly impossible to precisely control it, which inevitably sends it spinning off towards a wall which ensues in a 5 minute search for one or more of the propellers."
R3PNMXVIWYBQ8,made the party a blast.
R1EMDKVDID676V,great
R2Y61NZ0LAQKFT,"toys were cheap, whistles didnt work well but the kids seemed to enjoy it."

R3H96R0RVZ1676,i have bought 3 pairs over the past year or so and two of them have broken.
R3H96R0RVZ1676,the strap on the last pair broke after just a few uses.

R3M6K239G1L26B,loved it and i loved because he could use his building creative abilities
R3SAGD4DPE3ETK,a bit thin and probably need to carpet tape it to stay in place.
R3SAGD4DPE3ETK,not exactly what i was expecting and with the photo showing kids playing on it it is not what i was expecting.
R23Y5K14A6SUCF,my daughter loves this.
R23Y5K14A6SUCF,price wasnt too bad considering the prices of most of these.

RIIVFTCX2OC6U,these are fun little dominos to play with.
RIIVFTCX2OC6U,some have small holes in them from the wood having holes but they still work to stand up and knock them all over when your done!
RIIVFTCX2OC6U,"great toy, cant wait for my daughter to get a little older so she can play with them!"
RIIVFTCX2OC6U,i might have to get some more to add to the collection!
RU7Y9574JAJ22,"once you get bitten by the rc bug, its essential to follow thru with more alloy."
RU7Y9574JAJ22,"these fit nicely, different colors available too.do the math, $4.00 plastic x 5 sets  $20.00 plus labor of removing old and replace with new plastic or $16.00 alloy x 1 set  $16.00 and only having to replace plastics one time."
RU7Y9574JAJ22,clearly a nobrainer!
R1FJB20SR6KHON,good study playhouse.

R27RP9OYSFH7WB,"im not a fan of toys that make noise in general, but on the plus side, this kitchen has a volume control so you can turn it out to loud or quiet."
R27RP9OYSFH7WB,if you can tolerate a bit of noise then your two year old will love this.
RFS1J7JNS5WFO,concept is great and it looks great.
RFS1J7JNS5WFO,easy to fill up.
RFS1J7JNS5WFO,the only issue was when the kids pulled the strings it never came open.
RFS1J7JNS5WFO,we had to go back and open it up ourselves to let the candy fall out.

R2TNIAW5TDDYVP,then along comes jurassic world a definite viewing for anyone that loves the old movies.back in the day i purchased a much smaller version of this at over 200 dollars.
R2TNIAW5TDDYVP,it was all shiny plastic and i still have it to this day.that is why when i looked at this i am amazed at how much more realistic this dino looks compared to my old one.
R2TNIAW5TDDYVP,the skin and features looks amazing.
R2TNIAW5TDDYVP,i love technology and how far we have came in realism.

RD2GSATL5ETGV,it can record videos as well.
RD2GSATL5ETGV,my child just turned 4 and knows how to operate it with out problems.
R3LSIPAF8IEWLO,"this was purchased as a gift for our 3 year old son, who absolutely loves it."
R3LSIPAF8IEWLO,"as parents, we love it because it is completely compatible with all of his existing duplo lego pieces."
R3LSIPAF8IEWLO,"together, it provides for his endless imagination."
R343HUD87Y8J03,my daughter loves it so much!
R343HUD87Y8J03,was easy to put together.
R2L3MQPDXPZVB0,"well constructed, safe, easy for a 3year old to use to practice balance and jumping."
R2L3MQPDXPZVB0,"my only complaint, and its a big one, is that hes too lightweight to make it squeak and so he wont use it because its too frustrating for him."
R2KTHZ9KQDPQZQ,one of my grandsons birthday presents in august and the tie broke immediately
R7S06EPPZSBG3,perfect condition.
R2GIVCSYYHI4Q9,awesome lightweight sleeping bag.
R2GIVCSYYHI4Q9,my one year old loved it.

R3T2LKGYZ6X7SI,this is the best nursery set up i have seen

R2B9RUKZU1MJ9T,dogs love it thank you
R1UBGHT89DVJ2,these are great.
R1UBGHT89DVJ2,but not typical m&d quality.
R1UBGHT89DVJ2,they break quite easy for the more active child.
RAZY4I1V21O7P,this was a gift for someone
R2PV6KO3OJDYL7,just what my grandson wanted.
R2B2PPQOT9JE08,great value.
R2B2PPQOT9JE08,size and quality of the stuffed animal certainly met my expectations.
R2HWPFWCB35405,the concept is great and my son was so excited about it.
R2HWPFWCB35405,"however, the construction is very poor and the spray nozzle broke immediately."
R2HWPFWCB35405,i was able to fix it by drilling a larger hole for a new screw but was disappointed.
R2HWPFWCB35405,"additionally, the hose is nearly impossible to attach to the water tank as you cannot get your hand inside the bottom to push it onto the spigot."
R2HWPFWCB35405,there is quite a bit of leaking as a result.
R2HWPFWCB35405,"despite all of these downfalls, my son still enjoys this toy when hes in his swimsuit doing water play."
R1FTNDSDCQDRY3,grandson loved it.
R1FTNDSDCQDRY3,wore out batteries the first weekend.

R3AR12PKZN7LAY,this game is hilarious.
R10AEHQNS70JCS,my daughterinlaw was 8 months pregnant and couldnt enjoy their pool until i gave her this float.
R10AEHQNS70JCS,"it was so comfortable she fell asleep on it many times, and only wished she could use it other places, like her bed."
R10AEHQNS70JCS,the only negative comment was that she wished it was a little bit wider.
R10AEHQNS70JCS,"she is about 5 10"" tall and very slim, but would have liked to have more space for arms and elbows on the side."
RMVWT174IWE4K,very beutyful!
R10A94AOOZEJB9,"ive maintained my status as the worst human being in the room, thanks to this expansion!"
R2I895VVZXFIW7,like a sick stickgiggle tube in a shaker format.
R2I895VVZXFIW7,"these properly giggle, with very short, fast sounds rather than the sustained vomitus sound from the longer giggle tubes."
R2I895VVZXFIW7,"lots of fun, great musical alternative to a shaker or maraca for your joke songs."
R23OILFDNUUUR1,it got here very quickly and it looks great
R2UY887KTGCG0Z,perfect for our cinco de mayo party.

R3JBJ3PVSY1GB0,piece of crap
R9YMRDXLBPO82,i have only used one sheet but it was easy to cut and thicker than i thought it would be.
RA7B7F1Y0C93N,"im very happy with this doctor set,  more so than another one i bought."
RA7B7F1Y0C93N,"the plastic is sturdier, everything works nicely, and nothing was broken."
RA7B7F1Y0C93N,"plus, the parts that light up different colors are really neat and makes playing with it lots of fun, for my little girl!"
RA7B7F1Y0C93N,she was also delighted with the stethoscope which makes heartbeat sound effects and lights up!
R2JJ5VDBL7WU6Y,the plug leaks.
R2JJ5VDBL7WU6Y,our daughter likes it but i wish it sealed better.
R1RP9TXKB7KA3H,"when i ordered ""large"" i expected a large bag, what i received was more in the smallmed range."
R1RP9TXKB7KA3H,the books and gifts that i purchased for my grandson for his birthday will not fit by any way into the bag.
R1RP9TXKB7KA3H,not one gift will fit.
R1RP9TXKB7KA3H,i was very disappointed.
R3CM12AR5869UB,the dohvinci is fun in concept but the execution is lacking.prosfun the first timecan spark creativityconsmessynot that interesting
R1JJWT5QBCOLZX,got this for my son for christmas.

RCEYP6J1AK0XX,great for a 8 year old.
R1WTB3FMI18UTE,"if youre like me, and wanting to get this out of print card set to make the game more interesting, you can get munchkin game changers."
R1WTB3FMI18UTE,it has all the cards from this set plus four more sets at a lower price than just this one by itself.
R2VCVXL144IFGC,my granddaughter loved them.
R2VCVXL144IFGC,tucked one under each arm and carried them around.

RHX4ZDD5P0VNX,love them for a mess free activity
R22LJFYFXWB41M,this is crazy addictive!
R22LJFYFXWB41M,"if the battery lasted an hour i would try to squeeze 61 minutes out of it!first off, get rc provides two additional batteries which is a great deal."
R22LJFYFXWB41M,the cockpit shell has been configured to allow easy snapon snapoff to replace the battery.
R22LJFYFXWB41M,"i have been playing with it for a few hours now and i am getting approximately 15 minutes of flight time per charge.one draw back is that the provided charge plugs directly into the drone with the battery installed, preventing any charging while the drone is in use."
R22LJFYFXWB41M,i have ordered some additional connected and will be creating an adapter that will charge the batteries independently of the drone.
R22LJFYFXWB41M,once completed i will update this post with information of my successwhen ordering you do not have a choice in color.
R22LJFYFXWB41M,it seems to be randomly selected for you.
R22LJFYFXWB41M,i received the white one which i am extremely happy with.the learning curve on these things is a bit steep if you have never flown a quad copter before.
R22LJFYFXWB41M,it is extremely agile and you can easily compensate.
R22LJFYFXWB41M,i have an x4 h107c that comes with a larger controller than the one provided that also works with this unit.
R22LJFYFXWB41M,"vice versa, the smaller controller from this unit with link to the x4 as well."
R22LJFYFXWB41M,i personally like the little one during the learning phaseone suggestion i would make if you are a beginner flier is to purchase the blade protector for this model.
R22LJFYFXWB41M,i think it is about $5 usd and has a couple benefits.
R22LJFYFXWB41M,"1, it slows the copter down a bit to allow you easier learning of the controls."
R22LJFYFXWB41M,2 it saves rotor blade when you crash it.i am going to try my best to see if i can get another color so i can have flying duels with these things.
R1WKC8WKKO0DTF,if you collect great deal.not an ideal toy for children
R21E8D0ML0Q6JB,"excelent figure looks great, best price at amazon"
RIM990TLHFAZW,super tiny.
RIM990TLHFAZW,this thing looks like a toy that comes out of the claw machines.
RIM990TLHFAZW,it is much smaller than it looks in the picture.
R1TKSQ298QFCHN,arrived as fast as taz....great!!
R1TKSQ298QFCHN,!
R2KMKKVHX7EHOC,"cute, but string breaks easily."
R3LHAGZ3CKK2M4,this is for my grandson 5th birthday i hope he likes it.
R3LHAGZ3CKK2M4,"he likes stuff from the cars movie, so i believe he will."
R3LHAGZ3CKK2M4,he is starting to want to bat things around.
R3LHAGZ3CKK2M4,item is cute and price was good.
R3LHAGZ3CKK2M4,does seem to be alittle hard on end that hit the ball.
R3LHAGZ3CKK2M4,"shipping was really fast, so recommend this for a young boy."
REW2M3GI6P11Z,love these!
REW2M3GI6P11Z,there were 4 of each color making 20 dividers total and making enough to split my cards up in their long boxes organized!
R17X9DW4AUHVG5,my son loves the cars!
R1F42ACX01I615,bad quality!
R1F42ACX01I615,they are small so that they are hard for your fingers to insert.
R1F42ACX01I615,they do not look like the same as the picture.
R384BS0NZFZHZL,very disappointed.

R2R9NTIRDD1UHZ,in the tool box

R178YTTTHCVV51,as advertised
R18WAJ8YSR4NMD,i bought this for a project to do with my little cousins 23 years younger than me.
R18WAJ8YSR4NMD,i grew up doing these with my mom and i loved it!
R18WAJ8YSR4NMD,mine were never this cool though!
R18WAJ8YSR4NMD,we just had the whole paper and then created them.
R18WAJ8YSR4NMD,this would have been amazing as a young girl!!
R18WAJ8YSR4NMD,anyways we did these together and they loved them!
R18WAJ8YSR4NMD,they wanted to watch them shrink!
R18WAJ8YSR4NMD,i would totally recommend these!
R18WAJ8YSR4NMD,!disclaimer i received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
RG2QC5ZLWYDKM,this came and i was shocked that was a 4x6 inch box.
RG2QC5ZLWYDKM,i had to go buy another gift to give to my grandson.
RG2QC5ZLWYDKM,i will keep it for a small christmas present.
R2409AV4C4P5FJ,these are the cutest little guys.
R2409AV4C4P5FJ,"i had accidently placed the order twice and couldnt get to it fast enough to cancel, but i was so glad to have so many."
R2409AV4C4P5FJ,the kids loved them!

R1GFZYBCL5Z918,its exactly what my son wanted.
R139KU5MYUOW6L,we all loved this balance bike....my grandson was so proud!!
R139KU5MYUOW6L,!
R3G7AJ4FSVO9XJ,"super cute, and the kids loved them!"
R154Q8CCLZFRLX,i love the comfort of this product but area where the seat can fold up tears fairly easily.
R154Q8CCLZFRLX,so unfortunately they wont last very long.
RY2BNRFYR55F,husband said it was hard to thrown when it got wet.
R7FF9ANOP51JH,thanks for the nice game.
R7FF9ANOP51JH,there was little but it is good if you have a large table so that the pieces can not get away.good quality and very nice game.greetings
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"the figures are amazing and very detailed, particularly the main characters, the planeswalkers."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"we were impressed that even the creatures that are basically the same have slight differences, with arms wings, whatever in different positions or something."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,we were also hugely impressed with just how much stuff there was in the box.
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,wow.
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"the art throughout in the game itself, in the instructions is simply awesome.this really should be played on a table, or another flat, hard surface."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"we tried setting it up on the floor, and it doesnt work well on carpet."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"we ended up grabbing a large whiteboard and using it instead.turn counter  with that being in the book, we couldnt both keep the marker on the turn counter and refer to the instructions at the same time."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"not a big deal, just make a copy of that page of the instructions book for use while playing.the game is for 25 players, and we started off by playing with four players in two teams."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"the choices available are to play that way, or as a twoplayer game, or a third option of a freeforall with either 3, 4, or 5 players."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"one really nice thing was that the instructions acknowledged that when playing a freeforall that players may choose to form temporary alliances and that is fine.this game is a lot more reliant on cards than others weve played, with most of the action on the battlefield being determined by the cards and how they were being played.the game is limited to 60 turns, and when we first began we thought wed never reach that, as we were already fighting by turn 3. however, we did end up going to 55 turns before the game was over, so it really can go that far.the game says it is for ages 10, which seems fairly accurate."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"my youngest child is 9, and she enjoyed the game and was able to play with a bit of handholding, but it did get a bit too long for her."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,we dont think it would have worked very well for her as a freeforall  she needed to have a teammate who helped her with the strategy.
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"the rules implied that you were to do any strategizing with everyone present, but we adapted that the other team had an 11yearold so that the teammates could go off somewhere and talk strategy without being overheard at all by the other team."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"we also decided that there were certain characters that our younger two shouldnt play red and black as they tend to freak out a bit when their untis are easily destroyed, and those characters have strategies that rely heavily on &34unit sacrifice&34 which means a lot of freaking out."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"or maybe that is a reason the youngers ones should play those characters, to learn some better sportsmanship."
R1K0MQCMYDTI15,"im not sure.bottom line, my family is hugely impressed and everyone wants more!orall  she needed to have a teammate who helped her with the strategy."

R2Z2LYP1V0Z4T0,fun lego that can be made into three different things.
R2Z2LYP1V0Z4T0,my boys love this lego set.
R1SGSMJHM245F4,not so good for younger children!
RQJ9Y0SEV311H,my granddaughter likes making her flip.
R161DLID0H5XA6,devastator is great!!!
R161DLID0H5XA6,only problem is that mine came with no instructions.
R161DLID0H5XA6,youtube reviews on how to transformif you are a transformers collector he is a must have.
R2TQL0T5GL8IQK,my son has a lot of fun with it.

R1JYFMMF5CALR7,this sky hawkeye hm1315sthese is a piece of garbage it dont work and the seller just want to sell it he dont care if the drone dont work he dont care if you try to to reach him is a waste of money
RWTFBDK8L6SGG,awesome game!
RWTFBDK8L6SGG,even better with the expansion!
R2TFGDNZRUYPN2,this game strikes me as dungeons and dragons meets the legendary series of games.
R2TFGDNZRUYPN2,"the learning curve isnt too bad if youve played pathfinder and a similar deckbuilding game but if you are new to it i would recommend watching a ""how to play pathfinder wrath of the righteous"" youtube video and be ready to invest some time into learning the game."
R2TFGDNZRUYPN2,if everyone knows how to play the game lasts for an hour or two.
R2TFGDNZRUYPN2,if youre sitting down for the first time?
R2TFGDNZRUYPN2,3 hours.
R2TFGDNZRUYPN2,once you get the rules down the gameplay is pretty straightforward.
R2TFGDNZRUYPN2,"there are a certain number of locations out there and you send your character out to find the big, bad villain and you kill and loot along the way."
R2TFGDNZRUYPN2,its a lot of fun once you get the rules down and there are enough expansions that ill find myself coming back to this game time and time again.
R1K4R6GDZQU50V,great deal.
R2O3149K8VE058,love it
R1BIWEARYE6266,its a good game system but some of the provided cards are too popculture reliant and some are uncomfortable such as voting whos the most likely to be angry if their daughter married someone of a different race.
RAKWJ0E71MBVB,i cannot say how much i appreciate the many popular culture tieins that mega bloks has made recently.
RAKWJ0E71MBVB,"however, so far, this one has to be the best.the way that they have captured the fun and excitement of terminator genisys is truly awesome."
RAKWJ0E71MBVB,my favorite feature of this awesome set is the moving joints the figures are truly able to sit in a chair or crouch down to take a shot.
RAKWJ0E71MBVB,that sort of realism in play is what makes this set so totally awesome.
RAKWJ0E71MBVB,lego has got nothin on these guys.
RAKWJ0E71MBVB,"thankfully, the two brands ar largely interchangeable.awesome set that really rocks it!"
R2GCDTNZS4UJPT,great my granddaughter loves it
R3P6QWBAEUAXEY,great must get
R25B79ZGATURYG,this is great gag gift for politicos.
R39N86M33NVRBP,"my son is a real puzzle person, and he loves this."
R39N86M33NVRBP,"didnt take much time for his to master it, but anything that takes him longer than how quickly he solve the rubiks cube a successful purchase."
R39N86M33NVRBP,bright and colorful very well made.
R3VSSV6R5JV9RU,ive never flown an rc helicopter before and this makes it very easy.
R3VSSV6R5JV9RU,ive been having a lot of fun with this.
R3VSSV6R5JV9RU,i can totally freak the cat out with it
R1UXF2W3XS32EH,my daughter love it .
R2HLHY4SYJLUUX,work well with bow easy to find after they are shot.
R2HLHY4SYJLUUX,they seem sturdy
RORM4HUKYTDPV,"these, as other reviews point out, are the short colored pencils like the size you get with a golf scorecard."
RORM4HUKYTDPV,"personally i just needed a lot of different colors for an art project im working on, and these were fairly cheap."
RORM4HUKYTDPV,theres also a pencil sharpener on the box which works pretty well.
RORM4HUKYTDPV,"overall, id definitely recommend buying these unless you can find them cheaper elsewhere."
R3OBH9J2KHOET1,its not terribly sturdy and you can really feel it jerk when the kids play in it.
R3OBH9J2KHOET1,also the swings are very slippery so we have to purchase something to put on top so the kids actually stay on the swings.
R3OBH9J2KHOET1,and last was that the top green tube was warped and already had a dip even before the children played on it.
R3OBH9J2KHOET1,"anyway, i guess we will see how long this lasts."
R3B24SX1N2BYD3,love it
R2I5NJKOWS0VKA,good price
R33B1GDKLB7FRJ,bought this and a solo for my kid  he loves them
R35C1BBPKFPM2W,"came broken, very disappointing."
RK6ZPOHZY9O5I,this worst thing i see when i pay for new thing i got used one.....when i opened box the way it was packed it looked like it was used.
RK6ZPOHZY9O5I,"as soon as i fill air in that, i saw grass coming out it it."
RK6ZPOHZY9O5I,"i fill air in night that but did not last long till morning...i have start return process of it.my son like this, hence i have reorder it, hopefully will get something good..."
R165K78IJM6RKZ,worked
R2F2KHW0J4RPMA,nice marble assortment.
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"i think its rather inefficient to immediately decry the price when you havent bought the model itself, especially considering it is a newtool kit of a rather rare subject, and ships to your local distributor here from hong kong."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"i dont know if anyone has noticed, but shipping things across the planet costs money."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"obviously the previous reviewer has never seen a hasegawa kit, some of which can run upwards of $90 msrp for a 148 scale kit, and which often lack the weaponry, intending for the modeler to spend an additional $20 buying armament kits to actually arm their models not every hasegawa is this way, but a rather surprising amount of them are."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"while i have not personally purchased the f16xl yet, ive heard a number of good things about it on cybermodeler.com, and from the images supplied of the kit in their inbox review, the xl looks to be easily as detailed and wellengineered as their other line, kinetic models, of which i own the f16mlu kit, which is easily as good as a tamiya f16 kit msrp $65.... also one of the best kits on the market if youre a viper fan... and comes with very nice touches like a turned brass pitot tube and also a staggering array of armament, which according to cybermodelers review also holds true here, despite both the mlu and xl kits representing unarmed aircraft the mlu kit i have features a tiger meet air show mlu and the xl depicted on the box was only armed in trials."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"this is in stark contrast to some other kit makers the aforementioned hasegawa which, side note, are extremely nice kits despite the high prices, keep your eyes open for deals or go to model shows and swaps for deals, i have the f2a and f22 kits by hasegawa and while the ""limited"" edition f2 lacks any jasdf weaponry, i paid $50 for the kit and it is worth it, considering only hasegawa makes a good f2a in 148 and it is a beautiful kit, and the f22 is msrp $89.99 and also a beautiful kit, though i didnt pay msrp for mine and another example of a kit doing that that i personally have would be the kinetic mirage 2000bdn, which gives one the capability to model the nuclear armed mirage n without providing an asmp missile, or academys older issue f15e which gives a modeler four sidewinders and an antisatellite missile for a ground strike craft but i digress."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"skunk models and their branch kinetic make quality kits out of good plastic, and as a model builder and a kit maker myself i can attest that the cost of making moldstooling far exceeds the cost of the plastic or resin that goes into them."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"that being said, according to cybermodeler and luckymodel.com which is based in hong kong and is a skunkkinetic distributor the msrp of this kit is $39.99."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"it still costs an additional $1530 to ship here by various means, so that should tell you your seller is counting the cost of having to have the model shipped across the planet."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,thats why these kits cost a bit extra.
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"keep an eye out for deals and shop around, but the prices i am seeing on amazon are not bad for these kits with the level of detail they contain."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"if you want to pay $15, buy a revell kit, which you wont find an xl of not in 148 anyway and then you can attempt to detail your revell kit to match the much more detailed kineticskunktamiyahasegawa kits."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"i have f16s in 148 from almost all major manufacturers academy f16c, tamiya f16cj, hasegawa f2a, kinetic f16ammlu, and revell usa and of those, the only time the revell was worth the money to me was when i was 11 and painting with a sponge."
R2LBQGXSTZ8OVQ,"now that i want my models to represent the aircraft i love, i am more willing to spend more money to have a model that is worth putting on my shelf."
R3GDRORLF967SJ,the reason why i gave only 4 stars is there was missing parts bottom part of body it holds sand
R19R7NFPVL3ETA,"cute, but they do retain a little water."
R19R7NFPVL3ETA,you have to make sure you squeeze as much water out every time you use them to avoid mold.
R2HD4S0M55FP61,not really the right color red instead of green
R1FNH4ANW3AQ07,didnt work with my identifier lyric

R2FH8CUA6LDWZD,!
R3P6EN4Z4G7XQ6,tarnished a few months later with a very metallic smell...authentic feel to it though
R3GCAQQOM2QBZ7,absolutely beautiful.
R3GCAQQOM2QBZ7,the sizes go down to such a tiny tiny matrioshka doll.
R3GCAQQOM2QBZ7,great for those who live these traditional russian nesting dolls.
R1K7GBR5BGRKBW,this one didnt win any battles.
R2C7LME3QRMTBG,arrived on time and safe
R3V9NWSA7N38Y0,ordered for my sons 9th birthday.
R3V9NWSA7N38Y0,he is a big joker fan and this is the only one he didnt have and wanted.
R3V9NWSA7N38Y0,came just in time for his party.
R38YGA9XEXR2CP,i think our grandson will love this.
R386TJ52KZ8JN1,great set of flash cards for my kids.
R386TJ52KZ8JN1,"they can see the object and the word, which makes it easier for them to remember it and say it in the future."
R33OPCLVS3SRXO,bigger than g.i.
R33OPCLVS3SRXO,joes but not as big as basic figures of like 5 inches.
R33OPCLVS3SRXO,nice to display though
R161VX711KS32P,fun game.
R161VX711KS32P,reletively small footprint makes it a great game to play solo.
R161VX711KS32P,would be tough to get it to the table in a normal gaming group but should do ok with family.
RBR1JXYBLV3N2,my daughter thinks she know the gitar..because of this product.. love to see her play with it..
R3FNLO24Z1OAQ6,"this is a ""must have"" expansion for the base game."
R3FNLO24Z1OAQ6,"i give the base game itself a 55 star value, but only give the expansion a 35 value due to the impression that whats included really should have been part of the base game."
R3FNLO24Z1OAQ6,"as others have mentioned, do not consider this a stand alone replacement for the base game."
R3FNLO24Z1OAQ6,you really want a mix of character from the base game and this expansion to have a fun game and you really do want both to maximize the fun.
R3FNLO24Z1OAQ6,which means one night is really a $40 game when it should only be only $20.
R1TH5271XXKKUI,"most helpful customer reviewspainfully cruel to those living with or caring for mental illness by gayle on august 30, 2015size one sizecolor orangei am writing to share a serious matter of importance as it relates to this costume.my younger daughter, once an honor student, athlete and musician before her illness presented during the onset of adolescence, has lived with schizoaffective disorder for the past six years, and was hospitalized as a child."
R1TH5271XXKKUI,"weve taken her to ucla and stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness."
R1TH5271XXKKUI,"if you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a mental health treatment facility, i assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel.human suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a halloween costume."
R1TH5271XXKKUI,"i doubt you would sell a stage four cancer, holocaust or slave costume."
R1TH5271XXKKUI,why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder?stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair.
R1TH5271XXKKUI,please reconsider stigmatizing our daughters very real illness by removingthis costume and other mental illness inspired costumes from your inventory.

R8FA6NJ0XNHQI,product description and photo is misleading.

RG7FEN64BJMWN,product was of good quality.
RG7FEN64BJMWN,met my expectations.
RG7FEN64BJMWN,i bought two sets to make a monkey bar of a decent length.
RG7FEN64BJMWN,it was a little too expensive in that sense.
R1Q2YADOIKO58I,kids like it.
R1Q2YADOIKO58I,just bought it for their gifts before summer.
R1Q2YADOIKO58I,hope to keep them busy and thinking.

RNZOIT2ONYHC,wow what a fun toy for little kids!
RNZOIT2ONYHC,"this horse it is very darling, and full of lights and lots of fun for your little one."
RNZOIT2ONYHC,i did receive my horse free of charge to tested and share my honest opinion.
RNZOIT2ONYHC,my niece betty that is almost 3 years old absolutely adore the horse.
RNZOIT2ONYHC,"she has lots of fun watching it move around, with all the lights and a little music with the hoof sounds which should keep repeating .destroys made with hard plastic and it looks very durable to me."
RNZOIT2ONYHC,"he uses three aa batteries there are not included, so make sure you have the batteries on hand when you get your horse."
RNZOIT2ONYHC,"the batteries i easy to install, and there is a switch for on and off on the bottom easy accessible."
RNZOIT2ONYHC,"im very happy with this horse, and i do recommend it."
R3TVVH4DPXFSRM,what a great resemblance to grandad at the shedd aquarium very pleased
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,the kids conda hair brush and hair bow set is absolutely adorable!
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,"when i received it, i was surprised with the quality of the bows."
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,they are made of quality ribbon and are just the right size for my granddaughters 18inch dolls that have hair.
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,"when my granddaughter saw them, she commented about how much they looked like her bows when she ""was a baby."""
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,"since shes nine, that really wasnt that long ago!"
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,"i think its important to note that the clips on the back of the ribbons can be a bit sharp, so i probably wouldnt use them on an infant, but they would be fine for an older childs hair."
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,"the brush is small, but a good size for my granddaughter to use when brushing her dolls heads."
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,"again, i would caution against using the brush on an infants head because of the size and stiffness of the teeth."
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,the kids conda hair brush and hair bow set is a quality item that i would recommend for use with dolls.
R3UBQRJ86N23K7,"my granddaughter has enjoyed playing with them, and thats the best review of all!"
R1DN7Y5S42FD4N,love the color and feel of it.
R1DN7Y5S42FD4N,in the spring i will add more.
R1DN7Y5S42FD4N,so glad we went this way for a playground coverage at our preschool.
R3GOGYKLXG7SI0,kids love it and its mess free
RYE4YPU5IZAJL,very cute for the cheap price
ROY01L3B7437P,"came in today and it looks good, cant wait to use it!"
R3D6RX4XLH2YOP,cute for price.
R3D6RX4XLH2YOP,"one of them was bent during shipping, but not that big of a deal and its still functional."
REGVBH04CT7J2,seven years old and she still plays with them!
R3LLCLH17YZMVI,my teething baby loves this toy!
RQARM9ITLJWJO,pathfinder is a game based on d&d 3.5 thanks to the open gaming license.
RQARM9ITLJWJO,we typically play this over current d&d.the adventure card game takes pathfinder rules and molds them into a non collectible card game format.
RQARM9ITLJWJO,"it plays differently than pathfinder, but is still enjoyable and has many elements of the more complex core game.we have the skull and shackles pathfinder card game and have enjoyed it."
RQARM9ITLJWJO,this set takes the same approach but with the wrath of the righteous arc  which we have played in the core game.
RQARM9ITLJWJO,"the monsters, npcs, weapons, and skills are modeled after that arc in the core game."
RQARM9ITLJWJO,"many times i smiled remembering a person or enemy from the game.there can be spoilers, mainly a few enemies that arent obviously enemies in the core game  but overall there is enough difference and variety that i never felt i was replaying the wrath arc in a watered down version.the game can be played solo but i felt it worked best with four people."
RQARM9ITLJWJO,"gladly this set doesnt have the cumbersome ship rules of skull and shackles and i think the balance is just right.highly recommended for pathfinder fans or non collectible card game fans dominion, etc."
RVUE96GNCVYXI,pencil pouch was smaller than anticipated.
RVUE96GNCVYXI,overpriced for items included.
RVUE96GNCVYXI,grandsons choice of theme so did not return.
R1O5JXVFP7GEFC,dont be seduced by the price.
R1O5JXVFP7GEFC,these are just so badly made.
R1O5JXVFP7GEFC,its annoying that not all the animals stand up because the legs are turned inward.
R1O5JXVFP7GEFC,its annoying that the trees and fence dont stand.
R1O5JXVFP7GEFC,"but the real reason not to buy these is that theyre simply not safe for small children because the paint is sticky and peeling, there is exposed glue at the seams.if you purchase these, you have three options."
R1O5JXVFP7GEFC,"option one give your kid a bucket of terrible toys with sticky, peeling paint, and glue gobs."
R1O5JXVFP7GEFC,option two deal with the bother of having to return them.
R1O5JXVFP7GEFC,option three throw them away.
R1O5JXVFP7GEFC,we chose option two.
R3W0HQ4CULEW6K,its extremely hard to find a good mace windu because most have really weird face sculpts.
R3W0HQ4CULEW6K,"that being said, this windu is just sick!"
R3W0HQ4CULEW6K,he looks fantastic and can be posed in really cool ways.
R3W0HQ4CULEW6K,the galactic marine too is really cool.
R3W0HQ4CULEW6K,two things i didnt quite care for is that the gun bends super easy and also the marines color design isnt like the maroon guys you see shooting down ki adi mundi on mygeeto in the third movie.
R3W0HQ4CULEW6K,this figure seems to be custom designed to match windus color scheme.
R3W0HQ4CULEW6K,"other than that, a solid purchase."
R3W0HQ4CULEW6K,"oh and the marines helmet is removable, an added little bonus!"
RSBQJHEJS5JI5,grandkids enjoyed it
R2WW3SH3082GJ0,"great product, awesome customer service!"
R1WZNDRXY8XG8D,this was a gift for a friend who pulled through for me at the last minute.
R1WZNDRXY8XG8D,"needless to say, he appreciated it very much & put it in his deck."
R3KYODCI4C0P3R,i loved this puzzle  until i finally got it done and discovered three pieces were missing.
R3KYODCI4C0P3R,"amazon was great, as usual, and is sending a replacement, but it was disappointing to have to take it apart to send it back!"
R3KYODCI4C0P3R,hopefully all the pieces will be there this time.
R3KYODCI4C0P3R,"the colors were beautiful and putting it together was challenging because of the odd shapes, but i enjoyed it."
R3KYODCI4C0P3R,hopefully i can change this to five stars at some point.
R3AD3B1KL2SXHN,not at all what i was looking for.
R3AD3B1KL2SXHN,very disappointed
R2FM63LHU5P0BR,good to know there are still toys out there today that are made to last!
R2FM63LHU5P0BR,my 3year old boy uses this more as a bulldozer and man this thing is tough!
R2FM63LHU5P0BR,"super impressed with the quality, and i love the folding seat in front, perfect for giving stuffed buddies a ride."
R3QABPQESZX065,my daughter loves it.
R1YA9QR87T69A4,my niece really enjoyed these and the mega pack comes with tons of different pieces and colors.
R1YA9QR87T69A4,this kept her entertained for a couple of hours!
R27Q6LVKHI0XV7,a hit at our sons birthday!
R27Q6LVKHI0XV7,every boy there wanted to play with this!
R2994S516YATZP,love it
R1ZT983Y3UVAOB,great wagon!
R1ZT983Y3UVAOB,folds up nicely and easily when not in use.
R1ZT983Y3UVAOB,"we had to move into an apartment while our house was being renovated and this wagon has been amazing and indispensable for moving, toting groceries, trash & recyclables, the dog, etc... it has a nice canopy if youre toting kids or animals, water bottle holders, and extra pouch for keys, your purse, and misc."
R1ZT983Y3UVAOB,and retractable posts to hang things on.
R1ZT983Y3UVAOB,its sharp looking and we love it!
R31HXT5UM58RUV,my son loves this backpack and the dogs.
R31HXT5UM58RUV,he loves to bring them everywhere.
R31HXT5UM58RUV,i would recommended this.
R31HXT5UM58RUV,especially if your child loves dogs or pirates.
R3U6FZXCPQOVBV,they where fun for what we paid
R1M9FPJ5HXGP9S,"great puzzle, tho it helps to know your cites and states."
R2AB2P5CWKV10T,my boys love it
R1689WZBQSVCIA,"you receive a random variety, but these are totally worth it."
R1689WZBQSVCIA,"very cute, only one charm was broken at the top."
R24RCO5DYI1OO6,great product to help keep score!
R2VZV2GPC0HWNQ,the balloons were great.
R2VZV2GPC0HWNQ,the doc was bigger than i expected but my daughter loved it.
R36QXT054HO6KE,"i got this for a little girl that is obsessed with mermaids, she is 4 years old."
R36QXT054HO6KE,she absolutely loves it!
R36QXT054HO6KE,i love cooperative play games being in the game arsenal as well.
RH93W7GX8CK6H,"just wanting everyone on here to pay attention, when purchasing from amazon, look for the verified purchasers that is how you separate real from fake reviewers."
RH93W7GX8CK6H,you can only trust the verified purchasers.
R2X438VR57M2DQ,given as a gift
R2F7O0S3FC8IVS,getting this for anything under $20 is a good deal as long as the shipping is free especially if its $15 or fewer nets you an automatic 25 discount on your apps!
R2F7O0S3FC8IVS,"would be 5 stars if they manage to make an option of an instant code delivered electronically instead of wasting materials for a physical card as well as packaging which was fortunately very minimal as well as having to wait on delivery on something you can immediately input into your leapfrog account, then throw away."
R2F7O0S3FC8IVS,"an option to have a physical card for a gift is understandable, but the choice would definitely be nice, though all in all, worth it nonetheless as long as shipping is free!"
R2OEOU8OCBG0OW,one floatie didnt even inflate.
R2OEOU8OCBG0OW,"the other one was fine but because i didnt have two working floaties, they obviously didnt get used at the pool."
R2OEOU8OCBG0OW,not buying from this company again and wouldnt recommend.
R2OEOU8OCBG0OW,just not worth the effort to return.
R2B01G9JJTXUEU,he is creepy.
R2B01G9JJTXUEU,the only thing i would add would be a light from below so he is easier to see in the dark but easy enough for me to get a flashlight under his face.
R2B01G9JJTXUEU,spooky!
R38UEEFSJD7R0P,"excellent,"
R2JO66RFMIRA0R,"having two 24"" butterfly habitats, i thought this would be similar altho only 15"" high and useful as a backup container."
R2JO66RFMIRA0R,"as it is, it lacks a zipper halfway down the side to get to the caterpillars or butterflies, to add leaves or to clean out the cage."
R2JO66RFMIRA0R,"thus the top must be opened and that is another disappointment.the metal frame which opens the top of the cage is not even with the top it gaps badly possibly allowing caterpillars, etc."
R2JO66RFMIRA0R,to escape i will likely only use it as a carrier when we are travelingnot as an everyday habitat.
R1HQG2FPIA4VDF,"this is not a ""voodoo man""."
R1HQG2FPIA4VDF,this is the freak of crystal cove.
R1HQG2FPIA4VDF,"who turns out to be freds dad, the mayor in season 2 of mystery inc. i wont spoil the rest."
R1HQG2FPIA4VDF,very excited lego made a scooby series.
R1HQG2FPIA4VDF,its about time!
R25DO12G0569JM,its a gift.
R25DO12G0569JM,she liked it a lot
R1AU5Y3M8NANRA,bought for a gift and they loved it!
RT160A1HSPOOO,this pack of 10 comes with 70 stickers total was a huge success for our football loving boys.
RT160A1HSPOOO,they learned so much and got to tell us their favorites and such it was a great family time.
RT160A1HSPOOO,my oldest son was really excited.
RT160A1HSPOOO,he had a ball throughout the whole experience and i think grandpa had more funny telling him about each player than putting the stickers where they go.
RT160A1HSPOOO,it was a great bonding experience.
RT160A1HSPOOO,"i recommend it for anyone who like football, wants to collect football stuff or just wants to learn about the players."
RT160A1HSPOOO,i got this at a discount for my unbiased review.
R1XKZNUFD4L0L6,my 7 year old loved it.
R1XKZNUFD4L0L6,good assortment.
R2N15ZDB6JF97C,got these to give out as a party favor for my sons first bday.
R2N15ZDB6JF97C,added thank you stickers to them and they were perfect.
R1TL6TPTLYHLFQ,this product receives 3 stars for making a decent amount of nice bubbles with less frustration in that regard than many brands.
R1TL6TPTLYHLFQ,however...received the plain white ones like everyone else more annoying was that the lids were on so tight that at first i thought they werent useable at all for children after i paid extra for fast shipping.
R1TL6TPTLYHLFQ,then i made due by prying them open individually with a knife and leaving the lid loose so they would be usable by the kids.
R1TL6TPTLYHLFQ,the other thing i didnt like is the warning label acts like this is some kind of toxic substance instead of bubbles!
R1TL6TPTLYHLFQ,wash hands if you make contact?
R1TL6TPTLYHLFQ,who doesnt get bubbles on their hands?
R1TL6TPTLYHLFQ,my 8 year old was very concerned when she read it and when her friend got it in her eye...it says 5 and up so i told her its probably ok but one had to wonder.
R3DGMM96IVL2RU,the best stress reliever!
R3J9GRIOMSD2TL,"received in box, perfect condition."
R35ETO4VG5JLRX,i was pleased with the product.
R7TEDULCJLJZ3,these crayons have a very strong and even toxic odor.
R7TEDULCJLJZ3,i do not feel confident to allow children to use them.
R48P8CSS90I1E,my grand daughter love it
R15XR4RJT1PXC5,so cute!
RRCBSATOULIZ2,just get it.
RRCBSATOULIZ2,it is such a good game.
RRCBSATOULIZ2,"if you like horror board games, and games with very involved player interactions, this is it."
RRCBSATOULIZ2,"the game board is always expanding, and you dont know which scenario you are playing till later on in the game, so with those two elements, you will usually never get the same exact game each time."
RRCBSATOULIZ2,"you will be playing a horror story, and you wont know which one."
RRCBSATOULIZ2,"when the senario is chose, the players and the bad player will not know each others goals win conditions, so it adds even more to the great and different experiences players can get each time they play this game."
RRCBSATOULIZ2,"just get it, especially at the current price."
RBFD8YPCZ039V,"i bought this for my doctor who fanatic of a daughter as a gift, and she really loved it."
RBFD8YPCZ039V,"she loves legos as well, and while these are not lego brand, they are super similar."
RBFD8YPCZ039V,this set is great.
RBFD8YPCZ039V,this was a perfect gift!
R6TAPEYA8Q9B9,i wish this came in the 3 pack that the girls pads come in!
R6TAPEYA8Q9B9,i deduct one star for that!
R6TAPEYA8Q9B9,"the stickers jam packed in there, plenty to make a small child happy."
R6TAPEYA8Q9B9,the coloring bookpad was beyond the childs ability but he still loved the objects and scrawled over the pad with lots of colors.
R6TAPEYA8Q9B9,so even for a younger boyit made the boy happythat is what counts.
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,this swimming rainbow trout is absolutely adorable.
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"when you first see this little rainbow trout out of the package and in water, it looks like a real fish, especially from a distance."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,the detail on this rainbow trout is amazing down to the little dots on his body and his cute little wiggle eyes.
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"if you didnt know it was a toy, you would think it was real, which is exactly what the man of the house thought when i gave this rainbow trout a swim in the bath tub.getting this rainbow trout ready for water is quick and easy."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,he runs on 1 aa battery which is not included.
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"the battery compartment is well protected so that water does not leak into it, something that is very common with this type of water toy."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"if you just set the rainbow trout in water and turn him on, he floats in the water and swims around like a dead fish."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"what you need to do is hold the rainbow trout under the water until hes filled up with water and then let go and watch him rise to the surface, and then hell swim normally and not look like a dead fish or a sick fish.the swimming movements that this rainbow trout makes are very nice."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"there is no clicking or mechanical noises made by this fish when its swimming, so it doesnt look or sound like a toy while its swimming."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"when it reaches the corner of the bath tub or hits a wall, the rainbow trout realizes this and starts swimming in a different direction away from the wall."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"this is way better technology than i have seen with some swimming toys that will basically try to swim up the wall, over and over again."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"the rainbow trout has little wiggle eyes that move while hes swimming and is just so adorable.when you are done playing with the rainbow fish, hold him upright with his head facing upwards and give him a good shake until you do not hear any more water."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"he holds a lot more water than i thought and i am worried about the possibility of mold growing in this toy in the long run, but only time will tell."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"it took a little under 2 minutes of shaking to empty the rainbow trout out, and then i left him on his side, in the empty bath tub to dry.the battery life of this rainbow trout is somewhat concerning."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,a twenty minute test run and the rainbow trouts battery is already needing replaced using duracell batteries which generally last a long time.
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"i cannot imagine how many batteries he would eat through during a childs bath time.at the end of the day, this rainbow trout is adorable, swims well, and knows when its time to turn and start swimming in a different direction."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"despite the battery life, im giving this product five stars, because hes one of the cutest and least mechanical swimming bath toys that i have seen to date.i was provided with this product for free in exchange for my honest reviewlittle under 2 minutes of shaking to empty the rainbow trout out, and then i left him on his side, in the empty bath tub to dry.the battery life of this rainbow trout is somewhat concerning."
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,a twenty minute test run and the rainbow trouts battery is already needing replaced using duracell batteries which generally last a long time.
R11WD4IX5HSYEV,"i cannot imagine how many batteries he would eat through during a childs bath time.at the end of the day, this rainbow trout is adorable, swims well, and knows when its time to turn and start swimming in a different direction."

R1ILWJP0Y1VJG4,yeeeah.
R1ILWJP0Y1VJG4,i may play this game every other day.
R1ILWJP0Y1VJG4,my friend introduced me to the first dc deck building game.
R1ILWJP0Y1VJG4,"forever evil is the only one that i own and i think it has a little more opposition in it, by way of the cards being destroyed or your foes being attacked."
R1ILWJP0Y1VJG4,"its quick to pick up, i just tell people all the instructions are on the cards."

R3TD2ZMDXLZPP5,"dont waste your money unless you have a tool to solder the connection, and i dont..."
R1KXDX4J8KVCX1,my grandson thought it was great.
R1KXDX4J8KVCX1,looked pretty interesting to me too.
R3AT1LIZBQALKX,my son loves these rubber wrist things for whatever reason and deadpool is his current obsession.
R3AT1LIZBQALKX,"thus, this is fantastic!"
R3AT1LIZBQALKX,"hes 12 and skinny, so it fits his wrist with some room but not much."
R3AT1LIZBQALKX,"this would be flush on an average adults wrist, id imagine."
R26EBLDAK79B4M,have a professional bubble machine.
R26EBLDAK79B4M,gazillion bubble solution works for us.
R26EBLDAK79B4M,much better than the very cheap brands.
R26EBLDAK79B4M,"we use bubbles in parades, so we need lots of bubbles coming out of the machine."
R3DTEKV1L44BUQ,just what i expected
RXI9KY9KGSTXT,not sure what edition we have but the pieces are much to thin.
RXI9KY9KGSTXT,"the hexes are next to impossible to get placed right, and the interlocking border was warped beyond use after just a few games."
RXI9KY9KGSTXT,far inferior in quality to other games we own and even other editions of catan that our friends have.
RDQLGG3097I5W,dont waste your money theres almost nothing to this.
RDQLGG3097I5W,a few very small backgrounds and some reusable stickers.

R3PICVGXFR24LS,great product
RZ57KQT05J1MB,my 7 year old son loved this costume last year.
RZ57KQT05J1MB,well worth the purchase.
RZ57KQT05J1MB,we got a lot of nice compliments on it.
RZ57KQT05J1MB,"it does run a bit small, so keep that in mind."
R2ALG6M3GZDJAQ,the tomy constructable dinos are absolutely the perfect size for toddlers and little kids.
R2ALG6M3GZDJAQ,they were ideal for our two and four yearolds.theyre pretty basic in their presentation.
R2ALG6M3GZDJAQ,"their mother commented that they looked like something out of the 90s, which is all well and good and probably &34vintage&34 by now, but they definitely lack the bang!"
R2ALG6M3GZDJAQ,zoom!
R2ALG6M3GZDJAQ,"of too many of todays toys not a bad thing, just an observation."
R2ALG6M3GZDJAQ,"they colors are bright and engaging, too."
R2ALG6M3GZDJAQ,when motorized the dinos were able to traverse the wood table and concrete driveway with ease.the only thing to consider is the noise they make when theyre motorized.
R2ALG6M3GZDJAQ,its a low growl that might drive parents a bit crazy after a couple of minutes.
R2ALG6M3GZDJAQ,but theyre equally as fun even when theyre not motorized.
R2OZF9XJBJWHQX,real cute
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,i got this product free from buzz agent to try out.
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"my 6 year old son loves anything to do with cooking, so he was excited when this came to our doorstep."
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"i was skeptical of the product as i took it out of the box, stating that no heating or batteries were required."
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"the setup was easy, we just snapped together a few pieces and the set was complete!"
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"i filled the reservoir with hot water from our tap, added chopped candy melts, and waited for 2 minutes."
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,at this time the candy melts were already melting so it was super easy for my son to stir away and the result was smooth colored chocolate.
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"the spaces for the different colors are quite small, but then again so are the molds so we ended up not wasting any chocolate."
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,next we sprayed the chocolate mold we wanted to use and my son decorated away!
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"the plastic paintbrush is not the easiest to decorate with, and i wish this product came with other tools to facilitate decorating."
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"again, the molds are a bit small, but then again it is nice to have small chocolate treats for kids to enjoy than large ones!"
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,the directions were super easy to follow and the chocolates popped right out of the molds.
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,they even popped out pretty well when i forgot to use cooking spray first!
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"i dont quite understand the step where you clip the mold into the apparatus and spin it around, but it was fun for my son to do regardless."
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,we really enjoyed this toy and look forward to making more chocolates in the future.
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"it is not a high end product, but definitely a fun way to spend some time in the kitchen and my 6year old was able to do this all by himself after i did the hot water part."
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,clean up was a breeze as well!
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,"unfortunately the product does not come back apart once together, but luckily it isnt too big and bulky."
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,i would love to see more accessories for this product that we can try in the future!
R1CNNJZ2NX3MGZ,thank you buzz agent!

R2JGHVVSYAZ4QD,"ran around the pool just fine for a while, though it really it too fast for an average size pool."
R2JGHVVSYAZ4QD,"but, it failed to work properly after only a couple charges."
R2JGHVVSYAZ4QD,"runs randomly for a bit, but mostly just sputters around."
R2JGHVVSYAZ4QD,i may recommend use on a larger body of water for better results.

R2P02J645ZVOWT,okay but to expensive
R2G7X62EDLOOZH,"i actually purchased this kit elsewhere on clearance, and im very glad that i did."
R2G7X62EDLOOZH,"the thing is, ever since i first started modeling ive been hearing how great mini art products are."
R2G7X62EDLOOZH,"a few months prior to this build i had picked up the mini art poland 1944 kit, and had major issues with it."
R2G7X62EDLOOZH,"yes, the details are excellently rendered, and yes, this kit does come with many nice little extras to include some pe, clear lights, turret options etc."
R2G7X62EDLOOZH,"however, the lack of clear instruction, and the fragility of the track links alone quickly dissolved any good feeling i had about this kit."
R2G7X62EDLOOZH,"using sprue cutters and the most delicate touch possible, i still broke 23 out of every 5 track links i tried to remove from the sprue."
R2G7X62EDLOOZH,these are quite possibly the most fragile kits ive ever handled.
R2G7X62EDLOOZH,"now, that being said, id like to give this kit another go at a later time when ive got more experience with individual track links and folding pe because soviet tanks are just, well, awesome."
R2G7X62EDLOOZH,still...i was a bit disappointed.
R2GO8QWCVCONEJ,love her so much.
R2GO8QWCVCONEJ,however the box came ruined.
R2GO8QWCVCONEJ,it looked like someone played soccer with it so i had to take her out.
R2GO8QWCVCONEJ,very impressed with her and very classy unlike her half naked ones.

R39Y1UMTVBRCJ8,"cute, my daughter will enjoy it"
R1LTEZBWKSNWUQ,the board is great and on ordering i liked the idea of having wooden marbles.
R1LTEZBWKSNWUQ,"however, the marbles are so lightweight that it is really difficult to pick them up and move them."
R1LTEZBWKSNWUQ,i solved the problem by ordering glass marbles and will keep the wooden ones for backup.
R1LTEZBWKSNWUQ,this really is a great board for the price and even with the extra eight dollars spent on the glass marbles it is a bargain.
RSU0GOKDL8RNH,same as for the table above.

R1BNCA5C01FWIQ,my six year old liked this building toy even though it is intended for smaller children.
R1BNCA5C01FWIQ,the story book and building combination is a great idea and he liked being able to build on his own since he could read and follow the instructions.
R1BNCA5C01FWIQ,the pieces are easy to put together and handle.
R1BNCA5C01FWIQ,this is a very well made and thought out toy and the storage bag is a plus.

R2VHVU6ZA5WCMT,"the pacing makes for a fairly quick game that lends well to multiple games in a single session, and the setupcleanup is basically just shuffling a deck of cards."
R2VHVU6ZA5WCMT,"id definitely recommend sleeving the cards, since the main mechanic of the game involves pushing cards down a row or using an alternativesetup altogether."

R2RCRQKV44TV2,there is a lot to like about the thames and kosmos thames & kosmos remotecontrol machines animals product but a few key issues hold it back.the kit allows you to build one remote controlled animal w eight possible variations.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,it is easy to assemble and disassemble the kit.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,each animal varies in assembly difficulty but none of them took longer than 20 minute w assistance from my children.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,there is a lot of variety in the kits.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,each animal moves different and are not slightly different versions of the same base design.the directions are extremely well done.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,i wish more products had instructions this good.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,it took what could have been a complete nightmare and turned it into something even elementary age kids can follow.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,also included with the instructions are fun facts bout each of the animals.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,these trivia facts really help tie in the biomechanic component of the toy set.another nice touch is the multiband remote.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,this allows to have more than one machine running at the same time.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,"so if you buy a kit for more than one kid, all of them can play with them at the same time without the remotes interfering.the set does have a few issues."
R2RCRQKV44TV2,"first, the small red adapters that connect the gears to the drive unit are fragile."
R2RCRQKV44TV2,i nearly broke one on my first attempt at building an animal.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,"if these break, it renders the set nearly useless as there are not extras included."
R2RCRQKV44TV2,"adult supervision is needed with these pieces!second, the plastic skins are poorly labeled."
R2RCRQKV44TV2,there are several different colored sheets of precut plastic animal pieces.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,each sheet can contain pieces from multiple animals.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,it was a little frustrating to find all of the correct pieces.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,especially since many of the animals are multicolored and uses pieces from each colored sheet.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,"the instructions thankfully provide clear pictures on what the pieces look like.lastly, the plastic animal skins are hard to store."
R2RCRQKV44TV2,they dont easily lay flat once folded into shape.
R2RCRQKV44TV2,"so while the rest of the set will easily fit back into the box, the plastic animal skins are trickier to manage.overall, this is a really nice toy set."
R2RCRQKV44TV2,a few small nitpicks keep it from a perfect five star rating.nce folded into shape.

ROEGK56EB57S0,one of our all time favorite games.
ROEGK56EB57S0,liked the older electronic version they dont make any longer better but glad to get this one.

RXCM41MZ9G2HE,my kids 1 and 3 years are addicted to magnets.
RXCM41MZ9G2HE,we have at least a hundred of them.
RXCM41MZ9G2HE,this is the second melissa & doug wooden magnet set we have purchased the other one was animals i think.
RXCM41MZ9G2HE,we really like these and so do our kids.
RXCM41MZ9G2HE,my son has only managed to partially destroy one by putting it in our front loading washing machine with dirty laundry when i wasnt looking that one still sticks to the fridge just fine but the picture is pretty much gone.
RXCM41MZ9G2HE,"my kids especially like these magnets because they are easy for little hands to grip, and the magnet is easy for little hands to remove from the refrigerator compared to some of the really thin, cheaper ones."
RXCM41MZ9G2HE,"we also like these magnets because the kids seem interested in knowing the names of the vehicles, which daddy is more than wiling to teach them hearing tiny kids yell ""bulldozer!"""
RXCM41MZ9G2HE,never gets old.
R2KY18HZHGJ3WL,its a good card for a defenderwall deck

R3ANFEK9EQFM3M,great
R3GNPF2OMQT3XF,it is gorgeous!
R3GNPF2OMQT3XF,it will be perfect for the masquerade ball i will attend next month.
R3GNPF2OMQT3XF,"i would highly recommend this mask but if you happen to be attending, the bards of birmingham masquerade ball, just select another style."
R1P3YMVD8HXCT,"these sets used to be great  way back when someone gave a crap about their product  but the wood is not well finished and the drill holes are rough, so the marbles dont actually pass smoothly through.i was very disappointed."
REUQKZT2QFTHK,the answer keys do not match up.
R35OVE9WKO6O1E,nice pretend play costume.
R35OVE9WKO6O1E,very durable and made well.

R3O9RMX8CSUQ2B,bows and arrows strong boys having fun with them easy to use
R1RG1R9RO6EU3H,our 3 year old normal height for her age received this for her birthday.
R1RG1R9RO6EU3H,she was able to touch the ground and scoot along with minimal help from day one.
R1RG1R9RO6EU3H,the only complaint we have is that her inner thighs and inside of knees bump the frame work and irritated her skin.
R1RG1R9RO6EU3H,she seems to do better when wearing pants.
R1RG1R9RO6EU3H,"now, 3 months later, shes able to coast along and balance with her legs off the ground and loves it even more."
R1RG1R9RO6EU3H,"the bike is holding up well to falling over, being dropped, and sidewalk riding with her older siblings."
R2GCDZYMDHF9F2,the book is great.
R2GCDZYMDHF9F2,the bible stories are interesting and accurate.

R1FBMEPC3WEO27,"my little guy is a huge lego guy and i thought he might be bored, not the case here, he loves them!!"
R1FBMEPC3WEO27,!
RQHJCH5TL45PZ,"i dont think im going to have occasion to use the drink and wet function ... after all at my age, no lets not go into that"
R3HYSIOA51OPFA,this little car really rolls around and my 7 year old has used it for her rag dolls and just about any other toy that will fit in the seat.
R3HYSIOA51OPFA,"she loves the groovy colors, the fact that there are fuzzy dice hanging down and the seatbelts are a big hit too."
R3HYSIOA51OPFA,great for pretend play!
RG1OMH88I53HO,bought for a 3 yr oldliked them but little pieces hard for him to keep track of but the toy is great
R3VUW0SZ3NU9I9,dont know why this game is so highly rated.
R3VUW0SZ3NU9I9,i found it to be just okay.
R3VUW0SZ3NU9I9,"however, it would probably be a fun game for small children."
RJ3LF8K90ISRG,love it
R3UR4A6PTJHUDM,great fun for developing mindssensory play.
R3UR4A6PTJHUDM,"if you want something they can develop their motor skills with, this is one of the products i recommend."
R3UR4A6PTJHUDM,"no batteries, no screens."
R3UR4A6PTJHUDM,kids have to think and entertain themselves.
R3UR4A6PTJHUDM,"i only wish it was like the older wooden toys, and made in the usa."
R3UR4A6PTJHUDM,a bit of throwback nostalgia is nice.

R1TD6URULBIOX3,these cards are just what i needed for teaching emotions.
R3MYLGUPVM6705,silly putty use to me my favorite item as a kid it was pink and we would copy newspaper comics on it till the pink was a yucky color from all the newspaper ink.
R3MYLGUPVM6705,fun times fun times!
R3MYLGUPVM6705,i enjoyed being able to share that with my kids with this 6 pack set which my girls went crazy over of silver and gold.
R3MYLGUPVM6705,they glitter and shine they are full of shimmers!
R3MYLGUPVM6705,i loved it we molded all kinds of cute little things and had some amazing quality time together.
R3MYLGUPVM6705,i got to tell them about how putty was before and that we didnt have all these cool colors back then.
R3MYLGUPVM6705,i got this at a discount for my honest review.
R3FBE7QVP8SFFU,in time for my boys birthday.
R3FBE7QVP8SFFU,i love it.
RM95HLXAGGZWB,i am a huge collector of modern gi joe figures.
RM95HLXAGGZWB,i almost passed on this set as i army build in sets of 5 i didnt know what i was going to do with the extra low lights.
RM95HLXAGGZWB,i am sure glad i did not pass as i took low light camping and he saved the day.
RM95HLXAGGZWB,yah yo joe!
R1CB2IE337J0BA,my grandson is happy with his barrel
R2HNOUAVEW7WWM,"this is a relatively expensive, but wellmade item purchased for my two year old grandson who loves playing with his brio trains."
R2HNOUAVEW7WWM,this was bought for the set we keep at our house to play with.
R2HNOUAVEW7WWM,"when the train moves on the track between the crocodile and hippo they open their mouths and ""snap"" at the train."
R2HNOUAVEW7WWM,"i am new to the world of brio our kids played with other brands of building sets when they were this age, so maybe this is a nonissue, but i do dislike the fact that because it obviously cant be flipped over like other standard pieces of track, it always has to be set on an inside curve."
R2HNOUAVEW7WWM,i am still learning the ins and outs of building track and what we need to get to where we want to go.
R2HNOUAVEW7WWM,"while i am giving this an honest review of 5 stars for quality, i think if i had it to do over again i would have purchased a tunnel instead."
R2HNOUAVEW7WWM,"at 24 months, he seems to be at an age when watching things disappear and then reappear holds particular facination for him."
R26SDB9WL68KD8,very cute pillow!
R26SDB9WL68KD8,quick delivery.
RRNXJPKUFKBR4,"its ok board is quite thin and so it was ""warped"" when opened and weve played on it anyway, but doesnt seem to be ""flattening"" out"
RUL829VNR4C0Y,character box was damaged
R3J0JRZSJGU4BH,fun!
RHCWPLXPOR842,it worked perfectly and no hassle from spirit airlines.. i took it for a 3 day trip and i somehow manage to overpack with this 1 bag.. did not get a chance to use everything i brought!!
RHCWPLXPOR842,"lol, its spacious from top to bottom"
R3B65WWGOTE0DW,this is so well made its unbelievable!

R34A25I3GBJV54,no skirt was attached.
R1W5U4F50TOPZQ,no box
R6Q8OWOKOWT4I,my kids love these!
R6Q8OWOKOWT4I,i have kids that range from the ages of 27 and they all played with them for hours!
R6Q8OWOKOWT4I,i even had to get in on the fun for a while.
R6Q8OWOKOWT4I,it came with instructions to make a lot of different things but you can also be creative and make your own stuff.
R6Q8OWOKOWT4I,they are built pretty sturdy and i think they should last for quite a while.
R2P3WWQ62GGT5P,little girl loves it!
R2P3WWQ62GGT5P,one of our best buys.
R2P3WWQ62GGT5P,arrived on time and in perfect condition.
R1DTRE5609XEF7,this item is sized perfectly for the doll house i purchased.
R1DTRE5609XEF7,its a good weight as well.
R2M074XBY0FN42,my son likes the pictures but the tattoo didnt even last 12 hours.
R1SEIYF3EVIQTM,my kids love this truck.
R1SEIYF3EVIQTM,tons of great fun and the parts on this one compared to the basic traxxas rc cars like the rustler are of a better quality.
R1SEIYF3EVIQTM,it does flip over easy but thats because it is so much faster than our rustler.
R1SEIYF3EVIQTM,the speed and fact that...it is higher off the ground make it flip especially w a larger 11v bat.
R1SEIYF3EVIQTM,i think this is better for older kids 141516 or adults and the rustler is better for 1012 year olds.
R1SEIYF3EVIQTM,but my son at 12 can drive it pretty well too.
R1SEIYF3EVIQTM,it is just fast and has a ton of pickup.
R101PE1OUV1KWR,"whenever i tell people about this game, i describe it as simplified chess."
R101PE1OUV1KWR,i say this because each piece can do something different and it requires planning and strategy much like chess.another difference is that this game is far lighter and much friendlier.
R101PE1OUV1KWR,"each game can be played in 10 minutes and each is a ton of fun.i decided to get the pocket version as it comes with 2 expansions mosquito, lady bug."
R101PE1OUV1KWR,i also saw the original size of the pieces and it almost felt comical to me in comparison to the pocket size.hive pocket is the best version of hive and is a perfect abstract game for 2 players.
R101PE1OUV1KWR,it can be played nearly anywhere and i completely recommend it.
R3J0A74WROJMJ6,we bought this for our granddaughter.
R3J0A74WROJMJ6,she loves it!

R3J0A74WROJMJ6,it took about a week from to arrive from date of purchase to front door delivery.
R3J0A74WROJMJ6,it is bulky once deflated.
R3J0A74WROJMJ6,fabric is very durable and strong.
R3J0A74WROJMJ6,we have yet to fit it in the storage bag that it comes with.
R3J0A74WROJMJ6,we are planning on storing it in a plastic storage bin.
R3J0A74WROJMJ6,we brought it to great grandmas so the kids would have some entertainment and stay cool.
R3J0A74WROJMJ6,very pleased with our purchase.

RATIHSOYX4Z2J,looks exactly like the ones i had as a child.
R24OEMJ1888NZW,the kids love this toy.
R24OEMJ1888NZW,they make a little squeaky sound when you push on the egg that they seem to enjoy.
R24OEMJ1888NZW,they do have a bit of trouble opening the carton themselves though.
R1L784YRQ296XJ,kids loved it
R2C55F1TK5HUFI,very cool love um
R327FQDDUBTI41,got the car for my son in may 2015. a part that holds the suspension broke on the first drive.
R327FQDDUBTI41,i have replaced the part three times already as it seems to break every time we drive it.
R327FQDDUBTI41,i have bought extra parts now.
R327FQDDUBTI41,"then suspension broke..have replaced it..now car doesnt move, looks like transmission engages but does not run when on wheels but runs when i hold it in air."
R327FQDDUBTI41,just thinking whether i should fix it..since spent more than what i bought the car for.
R327FQDDUBTI41,just disappointed with quality.
R327FQDDUBTI41,"when i see the video on their website, i wonder how it runs so much without breaking."
R327FQDDUBTI41,would not recommend litehawk.
R2ZLAS8YCB5ER9,very relaxing to mindlessly move it around when anxious.
R2ZLAS8YCB5ER9,i recommend it to anyone who may have anxiety.

RT832EZVTARHM,cute.
R3RQUTYPQABMPQ,my cake looked great!
R12OA1AB6LSBKO,i was offered this toy pitchfork for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it.
R12OA1AB6LSBKO,it is the perfect lightweight plastic doesnt matter what happens to it pitchfork.
R12OA1AB6LSBKO,i would definitely take this with me on halloween because it is light and wouldnt end up irritating me.
R12OA1AB6LSBKO,"it is also a toy that kids could play with, if this is something that you let them play with."
R12OA1AB6LSBKO,"i personally think it isnt something i want my kids playing with, but thats my personal opinion."
R12OA1AB6LSBKO,"either way, have fun."
R2LCOD44VQYY13,my kid loves this tmnt series
R1L941MFD2NKQ8,i customized this for a friend who is a teacher.

RE438HI0YNKYT,"thank you, disney."
RDZVAGF614UFE,great product!
RDZVAGF614UFE,just what i needed.
R2HLYMU1PART9N,"i was unaware it uses a 9 volt battery until recieving and putting it together but once set up, it will go for hours until stopped or battery taken out  i dont know how long a battery lasts because i recently ordered mine  aug. 19th and recieved on aug. 26th 2015  once you start it by giving it alittle push then it speeds up by its self  i seen these yrs ago and always wanted one and never came across them in local stores and had never shopped online until recently when my son gave me a amazon gift card for mothers day !"
R3AU21MYMZNJ0M,my son loves them with his lego characters
R28MNLWI14HO6Y,"i loved these at first, but after a while the laminate starts peeling up on the edges and ive only had them a couple months and i wipe them off after use  not soak in water or anything."

R7IVNPAPQMQCJ,thankyou.
R1OD1WL8EIK2HP,"i got this as my son had just joined a club for robotics in the school, and asked if i could get him one."
R1OD1WL8EIK2HP,"its one of the best robotic introduction kits, and while its pricy all legos are, i think its a good educational toy to get your kids started."
R1OD1WL8EIK2HP,"im yet to use the one i bought, but as a product, this is great.price update i realized later that the that the lego education website has the next model including an additional sensor for the same price.. while i did not return it as i had already opened it and was in the middle of assembling it, i would recommend the next model on the lego website  for this price, it makes sense to have the latest."
R2Z8769KQY2KVB,amazing product
R2HI39YGM5T0QN,daughter loves her dell and this outfit to go with her.
R1IBECJ06J6EEI,perfect adult game!

R3IEXVP32YV2NO,"the big top compartment fits a 10oz water bottle, juice snacks etc."
R3IEXVP32YV2NO,the colors are so pretty and vibrant.
R3IEXVP32YV2NO,"it is very well made, the seams are sowed in nicely, and most importantly my my little one loves it!"

R2KPGRO3KTXDFW,"perhaps the price includes a roundtrip first class ticket to japan to pick it up, but then the shipping charge doesnt make sense?"
R2GATOC4EAQZID,my son loves everything imaginext.
R2GATOC4EAQZID,this was a birthday gift for him which was in july and he plays with this everyday.
R2GATOC4EAQZID,i like the fact that all the imgainext products goes well with each other when playing.
R2GATOC4EAQZID,its easy to put together and hours of fun for him...
R3SGNKYEPLDYOS,we struggled to put this together properly with the lack of words for instructions and fussy pictures.
R3SGNKYEPLDYOS,the wiring was also strange.
R3SGNKYEPLDYOS,i ended up calling and requesting a refund.
ROBKSSJ51B08D,perfect!
R18CWN6EOGJKR4,fun to build.
R18CWN6EOGJKR4,"goes together well, if you follow the instructions."
R18CWN6EOGJKR4,"looks fantastic when completed, though the ""articulation"" isnt all that great."
R18CWN6EOGJKR4,"my only real gripe is the need for the smallest, sharpest snips you can find."
R18CWN6EOGJKR4,even then i found the metallic finish chipping here and there.
R18CWN6EOGJKR4,i often had to get an exacto knife and trim off any burrs left from the sprue.
R18CWN6EOGJKR4,"still, im very happy with the finished piece."
R18CWN6EOGJKR4,i will definitely consider purchasing any future bandai star wars products.
R11KFN9VD8VD3I,"wow, this kunai was better than i thought."
R11KFN9VD8VD3I,not only does is feel solid but it also has a good weight to it.
R11KFN9VD8VD3I,definitely is finely made.
R11KFN9VD8VD3I,"the box was beautiful as well, nice minato design and everything"
R3878UMLSPP263,i give this product a 2 star .it came in 4 pieces.the piece on the top wasnt fit in the hole..it made of plastic and its not comfy to wear.
R3878UMLSPP263,i got this product free in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.
R2BEB3OIFK1C99,great game for 26 players.
R2BEB3OIFK1C99,i like resistance.
R2BEB3OIFK1C99,this game doesnt have the scheming aspect but has a bluffing and human relations aspect that i like.you are mostly paying for the game idea not for few well printed pieces of cardboard.
R23Y6BMRD4W36A,items are exactly as described.
R23Y6BMRD4W36A,my 4yr old grandson loves them.

RNQPLC3RIF0ZQ,one of best purchases we ever made.
RNQPLC3RIF0ZQ,we use it to load up on the beach and as a stroller to put our kids to sleep.
R8KRZUKT8XZQU,i bought several of these on superclearance at target and needed one extra for a party.
R8KRZUKT8XZQU,this is an easy craft and produces a fairly nice usable pinboard.
R8KRZUKT8XZQU,the other craftabelle craft that i recommend is the one with the tulle and twinkle lights.
R2Z30X03PW12ZQ,very cute mini versions for the lovely 18in doll clothes.
R2Z30X03PW12ZQ,"the only thing that would make them better would be notches on the arms to ""catch"" the clothes or hang straps from... but they are the perfect size and the wood is smooth and metal fits tightly in the wood so they seem to be very well made."
R2N9JRD99NW5D6,havent used it yet but it seems sturdy to hold a couple of kids.
RY3258VN5Q275,article i arrived i used.

R150X6AKV35E0X,nice designs for price.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,my first purchase of the hubsan x4 was not good.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,it arrived and had a faulty battery charger.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,i contacted the seller who immediately pointed me in the right direction and within a few minutes a replacement was already on its way.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,i want to express my appreciate for the sellers customer service.once i got the hubsan i was hooked for several hours.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,when i purchased it i also purchased additional batteries and a 5 port charging hub.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,both items invaluable to the increased enjoyment of this dronei get approximately 9 minutes flight time out of the drone when not recording video and approximately 7 minutes when i am.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,"this drone is shipped with a blade protector ring which is hidden underneath the white molded plastic piece, make sure you look there before calling seller like i did."
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,use it.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,getting used to the controls take a bit of practice and the protective ring will save you a few headaches.the quality of the video is exceptional.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,after a few hours of practice i was able to take the drone outside and handle it quite well.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,the range is excellent.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,much further than the instructions suggested.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,when making videos make certain to read the instructions first.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,there is a series of steps to take to prevent erasing the videos.the controller that comes with this drone is quite nice and packed with features.
R26UEWKBJSJREZ,oddly enough it will also link the the estes proto x nano drone that i also purchased.i dont see myself getting bored of this thing for a very long time
R3LGWHUYPD0QTN,other than a note that directions would have helped.
R3LGWHUYPD0QTN,"the propellers come right and left handed, worked great."
R2XMCVAZY1LOTQ,nice a car but i got without stickers.

RI5EVUFW17I0O,"after voting for trump and letting my daughter emulate miley cyru,s this is the third best thing that has happened to me."
RD5N3ZT1GP1TR,unhappy with the purchase.
RD5N3ZT1GP1TR,product was assembled exactly as instructed.
RD5N3ZT1GP1TR,extremely unbalanced  constantly tips over.
RD5N3ZT1GP1TR,should be very easy to maneuver but it is very difficult and neither of my boys will use it though not for lack of trying.
RD5N3ZT1GP1TR,ages 4 & 7
R1E2JOAZRPQ4NL,"absolutely beautiful, used these to fill clear balloons and also sprinkled on the tables."
R1E2JOAZRPQ4NL,"very festive, gorgeous colors, and a nice amount for the price."
R1E2JOAZRPQ4NL,ordered two packs and used less than half of one.
R1I2N8P1ALKX3E,good quality.

R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,"yeah, a cheesy titanic reference, but thats how we felt playing this world edition of monopoly!"
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,"no longer limited to the boardwalk of new jersey, you can potentially own the world....cue mustachetwirling bond villain here."
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,lolthe coolest of the cool things about this edition are the goldtone iconic players pieces the eiffel tower the statue of liberty the sphinx and a moai of easter island.
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,"very cool and international, indeed.lets be clear this is monopoly, so you either enjoy the game, or not."
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,this is not a fastpaced game but a bonding time for your family and friends if you want some quality time together.
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,"for younger members, this is a wonderful ""afternoon special moment"" for parentsmentors to teach them about the world outside of their own neighborhood."
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,"weve played this game 4 times since receiving it and each time, weve taken a different local pariseaster islandellis island and egypt to teach ourselves and kids about those places."
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,"the board offers far more locals than just the playing pieces limahong kongand lisbon, for example, to build global knowledge."
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,were a globeowning family so we also use that as a teaching tool each spin of a different country results in us finding that countryplace on the globe.the passport is a very new idea as are the money trays.
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,"all in all, if you want to add to your classic monopoly collection or youd like this to be your default game board, you will not be disappointed in this new version."
R1TUZEP91DHMRZ,d
R1H0GOOINDTQJZ,perfect for to make it lower

RA9WASY0PFTFP,poor quality.
RA9WASY0PFTFP,one of the legs on the bottom cover was already cracked and fell off after snapping the leg back in a couple of times.
RA9WASY0PFTFP,"the props, batteries and motors seem to be ok."
R3FJYDN48124Q1,my daughter enjoys this toy!
R3FJYDN48124Q1,she says the trigger seems unnecessary and you should just use it like a regular bow and arrow set.
R3FJYDN48124Q1,depending on your level of archery skills will depend on how well you shoot!
R2WKR1E7CCN2HH,i bought this for my grandson and he likes it.
R2WKR1E7CCN2HH,it arrived quickly and well packaged.
R2WKR1E7CCN2HH,"it was easy to assemble and i will be buying additional tracks to enlsrge it, but for a 4 year old it is good for now."
R2WKR1E7CCN2HH,"it is a nice set, but the only drawback is that the car does not really change color in the water, it seems to be a slight change in shade that lasts only momentarialy, that is why i give 4 stars and not 5. it is otherwise a good set, hotwheels makes good products and my boys were always happy with them and i will continue to purchase."
R22OT8ULSVAELC,awesome.....will have so much fun with these with the grandchildren.
R22OT8ULSVAELC,"put a smile on all the faces, mostly the adults!"
R1E4A37BRZ3XHD,really nice puzzle.

R2P3P1LDOQ5HVV,they were great for the price and none of them broke when the kids were playing with them.
R2A3A0143EOGHL,do not purchase this as the band that is used to seal off the balloon after filled does not work and the water just pours out.

R3KAFVHKQIX6O2,the colors are bright and its well made.
R3KAFVHKQIX6O2,a wonderful gift for the little john deere enthusiast in your life.
R58RLFZF581XM,"it really stands out on the street and as soon as cars turn on, its a reminder that there are kids around."
R58RLFZF581XM,i think these should be mandatory for streets with kids that play outside.
R3RK64EYEKA2KN,so soft!
R3RK64EYEKA2KN,and my 7 month old has already fallen in love with this little guy.
R3RK64EYEKA2KN,he can sit up with her and is small enough for her to pick up and play with.
R329BEVYMWR6RA,granddaughter was in seventh heaven
R8K724YHH7CGV,i bought this game for my twin granddaughters who are 5 andahalf.
R8K724YHH7CGV,they love this game and what makes it so nice is that they are on equal footing when playing this game with adults.
R8K724YHH7CGV,who am i kidding?
R8K724YHH7CGV,they are better than i am at this game.
R8K724YHH7CGV,they beg me to play it whenever im in town visiting.the playing pieces are wood which you cant tell from the picture.this game is such a favorite in their house that my daughter purchased the travel version.
R8K724YHH7CGV,the travel version is quite well done.
R8K724YHH7CGV,even the pieces in the travel version are wood.
R8K724YHH7CGV,it is probably one of the best travel versions of a game that ive seen.kids and adults love this game.
R8K724YHH7CGV,i highly recommend it.
R8K724YHH7CGV,there is no reading required but someone does have to keep score which amounts to counting up the points from a turn and adding it to the previous total.
RZVM5ETDR9CYE,"great product, great price"

RV2G93IUNUY82,great find
R1EX8ZBF585BBF,these little balls dont stick together very well.

R3B0QBUB00GV4O,a okay
RGZTNCP0YTO5N,"i had the screws that held on the purple piece that held the shutters in place start to pop out from my son playing with it, and hes only 11 months so he wasnt being to rough with it, so i ended up just taking that piece off because i was afraid the screws popping out would be a choking hazard."
RGZTNCP0YTO5N,"i also tried pushing the screws back in but they always popped back out, its like the plastic where the screws go in is stripped."
R13ZKCCP91BQET,"grandson loves to play with them, especially since he just got back from disney world."

R2W8JJNX86SXUR,"havent actually used it yet, but the bearings were almost locked up when i opened the package used some penetrating oil, they got better, but i doubt theyll ever be smooth enough to actually balance anything."

R15KXH3TWYCCYQ,"its the elder scrolls v skyrim, in a box!"
R15KXH3TWYCCYQ,love this game and love all the expansions!
R15KXH3TWYCCYQ,can be great rolling solo but its truly amazing when playing with friends.
R15KXH3TWYCCYQ,only complaint is that the directionsrules are not organized in an easy to follow structure.
R15KXH3TWYCCYQ,takes a few times through the booklet.
R3H07WSY8GLBZM,"while my daughter really loves this, the play back screen is really hazy and it is difficult for her to see the pictures shes just taken of the gang around the clubhouse."
R3H07WSY8GLBZM,"kinda disappointing for me, but she doesnt seem to mind."
RPB8HTT9CJI83,half of these markers arrived already dried out...what a bummer.
RD6D8IXKNWCMC,the aquaman man action figure i ordered is amazing but the package was damaged.
RD6D8IXKNWCMC,since it was damaged it was disappointing to two a collector like myself
R7D7R7ADKHB23,solid raft for two.
R7D7R7ADKHB23,the cooler worked out really well.
R1ILO83D1Z2P4X,my 2 year old loves it!
R1ILO83D1Z2P4X,"however, we just realized the zipper handle is missing..so we have to use pliers to take the cover off."
R1YTW4D7A6BF18,my grandson plays with it all the time!
R3QVFFECXEW9IV,one of the three balloons had a hole in it and the lady at the party overfilled one with confetti so it wouldnt float so the store had to cut them open to get the confetti out she had put in them for the gender reveals...so we cant return them obviously but we were very disappointed because they are a great size...we were doing a triplet reveal so we had to buy regular size balloons which was a bummer..you could see the confetti through these balloons even though they are black if you were standing close to them so keep that in mind....order an extra pack just in case so you dont get left in a lurch because of holes in the balloons.
R3QVFFECXEW9IV,"most party stores dont carry this size balloon.just return the extra pack if you dont end up needing it, but i would rather be out a few extra bucks then not have what i wanted for my gender reveal..."
R1QOZI0CHGKRAV,my girls who are 1 and 4 love it but the quality isnt great.
R1QOZI0CHGKRAV,its flimsy material and after using it for three days the top flag was pulled off accidentally making a huge hole in the top where the poles fit in so it kept collapsing.
R1QOZI0CHGKRAV,we had to sew it closed.
R1QOZI0CHGKRAV,it also came with a small hole on the side and an area in the window that wasnt sewn well and showed as a hole.
R1QOZI0CHGKRAV,"but they love it so much we just keep using it, just dont expect it to last very long."
RR10U0ULXF4WS,very happy and fast delivery.
R1RLKXMKUQXHW5,"after doing much research we have found this product to be the best product value and fast shipping was even better, thank you..."
R2DLBS96MVDCGK,these r so cute on my daughter dolls......they fit just right.........thank u
R3SARFM3H039GD,i have never seen any cards do what this whole deck is doing...the front of the card is separating from the back.
R3SARFM3H039GD,"not just on one card, but on nine so far."
R3SARFM3H039GD,"when the first one started coming apart, i scotch taped it."
R3SARFM3H039GD,then more started separating.
R3SARFM3H039GD,"they were being used by four adults, so there was no rough handling."
R3SARFM3H039GD,these cards are too pricey for this to happen.
R1S3RL8UP1DIST,nice product.
R1S3RL8UP1DIST,i ordered the wrong size and the staff kindly allowed me to make the correction.
R1S3RL8UP1DIST,all my error but they were great to work with and make the correction!
R2WPA7K4DRAZMV,it is very cute but very small!
R2WPA7K4DRAZMV,the full set up is big enough for a 1 year old and the large set up a 2 year old.
R2WPA7K4DRAZMV,any child above that age will not fit this product.
R2WPA7K4DRAZMV,"however, since my so just turned 2 i am sure we will get a good year of enjoyment out of it before we pass it on to another toddler to enjoy."
R2WPA7K4DRAZMV,still worth the money!
R284UHJ90Y8J9T,my cousin loved it as his birthday present.
R284UHJ90Y8J9T,the dragon with the lights is a nice touch.
R20BVSH33TVFSW,"they work great, my son and grandson went to a cubs game and james was able to see the players."
R2V94KGE5F6XWZ,my daughter love it but dont think it suit with infant because of the metal part
RL2UD5R1BJYLQ,unfortunate that it didnt survive a trip through the top rack of the dishwasher.
RND1M76O2UM3Q,my nephew turned 3 and loves anything firefighter related!!
RND1M76O2UM3Q,he wants to wear it everywhere....this outfit is well made and if your child is into pretend play this is the perfect gift or halloween outfit
RMIZ8JV44J0LR,so you have to know what youre getting here....fun but a mess in the making.
RMIZ8JV44J0LR,beados were new to me but not my 4 yop daughter...theres a zillion youtube videos out there with these.
RMIZ8JV44J0LR,"anyway this the entry set and there are plenty more thematic types out on the market.my kiddie didnt last long with following the color coded patterns and was more interesting in loading the machine, shooting beads, then &34glueing&34 them.i did not like the beads spilling on the floor though."
R15RT4A74AGO0T,it was a birthday present for my grandson and he loves it!
R15RT4A74AGO0T,!
R2L7Q05TCKU4KR,great!
R1BXMM7S536QTK,"this is a very simple kit, and is an excellent one for those who are wanting to start out learning to airbrush gundam."

RS9TEN9X0L299,this item is very cute and the child i bought it for loved it.
R5KROS1FGHHBK,its not as long as i thought it would be.
RKNM2LYCRTHOK,the kids can play this for hours.
R2N4ENB79J5WSH,nice
R17N6DA2A4YNBX,my daughter had it since shes 3 months old.
R17N6DA2A4YNBX,it goes to bed with her every night.
R17N6DA2A4YNBX,now shes two and shes still play with it.
R17N6DA2A4YNBX,"very nice, calm, and soothing music."
R1J28K3TPBDRP7,i bought this for my granddaughter who is 2. she is going to be a big sister in a couple of months.
R1J28K3TPBDRP7,she loves playing with it.
R1J28K3TPBDRP7,she is taking off all of her doll clothes and putting them in the washing machine like her mom does.
R1J28K3TPBDRP7,great gift.
R214OWMJQQ88DB,"have not used these yet, but they look like a fun project for when the grand kids come over."
R1ABDQV9P778YN,this bed is awesome!
R1ABDQV9P778YN,"quality solid wood, sturdy and very easy to put together."
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,for the money i would have expected this to be much bigger.
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,"when we were kids these things were larger, almost the same size as our heads."
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,this thing is only about the size of a dolls head.
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,"my daughter kind of likes it but it limits the hair styles she can do because the head is so small, the hair is too short even though it looks long and flowing in the picture."
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,it is very lightweight so she has to hold the thing between her legs to work on it.
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,"in other words, there is no way of attaching it to the table, i.e."
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,"suction cups, etc."
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,"also, when she first began to brush the dolls hair, a lot of hair came off the dolls head."
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,i was mortified.
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,luckily the doll still has hair on her hair.
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,i guess it was hair that just wasnt well seated on the dolls head.
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,i saw my money just floating down the drain in the first disappointing disappointing 10 minutes she spent with this toy.
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,"overall, for the price of over $40 i expected more."
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,i expected a larger toy that was better made and just more substantial.
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,not worth the money in my opinion.
R1HLCHMSE7AFG3,they just dont make things the way they used to.
R3AML42KRVSR9S,works like it says and is heavy duty
RKAYI3QZXE203,they are bigger then the batteries that came with the drone.
RKAYI3QZXE203,a pain to put in.
RKAYI3QZXE203,you can break it if you are not careful.
RKAYI3QZXE203,work ok other then that.
RROS1MPDTJNMR,grandson loved it!
R2VSTNKJ7XUHDH,these tricks wont disappoint.
R2VSTNKJ7XUHDH,easily explained on the dvd and after a little practice they can be mastered.
R2VSTNKJ7XUHDH,highly recommend.
RDBQA85HKTUT,i want more of these but this is a start.
RDBQA85HKTUT,seriously though i want to fill the whole page with light color.
RDBQA85HKTUT,should sell them in bigger quantities than this and just a little too expensive to buy more.
RDBQA85HKTUT,i may break down in the future and do that but with them being so expensive i wouldnt hold my breath.
RDBQA85HKTUT,i may have to make do with what i have now or look for them at garage sales.
RDBQA85HKTUT,the price was prohibitive.
RDBQA85HKTUT,.
R2Y1FSZRKV1DZ,great toy to keep your child entertained for a long time.
R2Y1FSZRKV1DZ,"remote is easy to use, and makes tractor sounds as your kids push buttons to operate the tractor."
R2Y1FSZRKV1DZ,"the tractor works on dirt, carpet, hardwood floors, and tile."
R2Y1FSZRKV1DZ,chargeable battery pack last a long time.
R2Y1FSZRKV1DZ,"only issues with this tractor is kids have a tendency to pick it up by the loader in the front, which seems to be the an area that could potentially break easily."
R2Y1FSZRKV1DZ,so far my 2 12 year old son absolutely loves it.
R3LJITBZ8ZAPQA,my two years old son looked adorable in this custom
RQU85RCKRW6PY,"as the title suggests, this thing seems unbreakable."
RQU85RCKRW6PY,weve had this thing since christmas 2014 and the helicopter is still not broken.
RQU85RCKRW6PY,"we fly it into the ceiling, into the walls, into the floors, and into the dogs mouths, and nothing phases it!"
RQU85RCKRW6PY,"the turret thing doesnt fire too far, so its kind of useless."
RQU85RCKRW6PY,"and, the helicopter cant go backward and forward very easily."
RQU85RCKRW6PY,"however, the fact that it cant be broken is a huge plus."
RQU85RCKRW6PY,i bought a radio shack copter that was about the same as this one and it broke within five minutes of use.
RQU85RCKRW6PY,"i would definitely recommend this one.as a side note, the easiest way to get around the battery requirement this set requires a lot of batteries is to hack the remote and turret."
RQU85RCKRW6PY,"cut batterysized place holders out of a wooden dowel, insert screws into both ends, attach a wire jumper from one side of the &34battery&34 to the other, and attach an adjustable power cord to the last battery and youll have a reliable, neverending power source assuming youre not a deadbeat and pay your bills."
R2VVX5WVA73ZF0,"these are very, very thin, fragile shingles."
R2VVX5WVA73ZF0,many were broken when they arrived and working with them requires significant care to avoid more from following suit.
R2VVX5WVA73ZF0,fortunately there are a lot in the bag so i was able to complete the projects.
R2VVX5WVA73ZF0,i finished one with enamel and another with acrylic paint  both worked well.
R2VVX5WVA73ZF0,not sure if better packaging would help keep them intact....
RFM1GRDJ0XY7G,"not that happy with it, water balls dont shoot very well.."
RFTEU367O5EN2,we lost the sugarberry.
RFTEU367O5EN2,"this is a little plastic food thing that goes with starlily, and she would make fun noises when &34eating&34 it."
RFTEU367O5EN2,"my daughter is not happy.starlily is a very fun, somewhat interactive toy that takes four batteries, makes fun and pleasing sounds, and has become a favorite toy for my daughter."
RFTEU367O5EN2,"so much so, in fact, that when the sugarberry became lost, days were spent looking for it, but alas, it has yet to be found.my younger son also likes starlily, but pretends not to."
RFTEU367O5EN2,"it is, after all, a flying unicorn, and boys are not suppose to like those things."
RFTEU367O5EN2,"at least thats what he says, even though my wife and i have told him that its okay to like any toy, regardless if its made for a boy or girl."
RFTEU367O5EN2,"perhaps, he has asked, there is a cool dinosaur like starlily that he could get."
RFTEU367O5EN2,or maybe a turtle.
RFTEU367O5EN2,"regardless, he really likes it as well, almost as much as my daughter, and he really wants one like it.that, in and of itself, should tell you a lot about the quality and desirability of the toy."
RFTEU367O5EN2,"even boys want one the toy has held up very well over the last month, especially considering how much it is played with."
RFTEU367O5EN2,"the horn lights up with multiple colors, it responds to your touching and talking to it, and it moves around very realistically."
RFTEU367O5EN2,"i like how it blinks its eyes there is an ipad app that goes along with it, but my daughter has not gotten around to using it with starlily yet."
RFTEU367O5EN2,"the app is free on the itunes store.all in all, this is a great toy, and while pricey, i think its well worth it for the enjoyment my daughter and secretly son has gotten out of it!"
R3FF0DXQV75802,the bat bottom part was missing in the original shipment & in the replacement shipment as well.
R3ANIQJINYE3UT,"my 24 month old grandson loves playing with this, but the magnet in the wand is not strong enough for him to navigate the balls through the maze himself, so we do it together."
R3ANIQJINYE3UT,it definitely takes more dexterity than most twoyearolds probably have.
R3ANIQJINYE3UT,"even still, we have a great time with it playing together."
R3ANIQJINYE3UT,he tells me which ball to grab and where to place it.
R3ANIQJINYE3UT,he loves when i try to trick him by putting a ball in the wrong colored home space.
R3ANIQJINYE3UT,"i am only giving this 4 stars because the orange colored ball is really not orange at all, but a rather palelooking orange with a brownish tinge."
R3ANIQJINYE3UT,"it is really nice that there are two colors of green and two colors of blue, because he has learned the concept of ""light"" and ""dark"" colors."
R1HOW38IGPDUM2,"it shoots pretty well, but its very large and annoyingly loud."
R1HOW38IGPDUM2,not good for smaller children.
R1HOW38IGPDUM2,where are the simple motorized disc shooters of yesteryear.
R1HOW38IGPDUM2,seems like theyve all but disappeared but i dont remember them being as loud as this one is.
RT2ZRBHVXY4A8,it looks more than a shark than a dophin.
R7U3615HUWG8T,it was easy to operated but had terrible sound quality.
R7U3615HUWG8T,could not use it.
R9CIPSJGKG0SF,came in timely manner and was as described in product description.
R3CSI0JEHU5BLH,this was a present for my boyfriend and he loved it!
R1QLLIVFLZRGN8,my daughter has wanted a dream lite for quite some time now and when i saw how cheap this one was i couldnt pass it up.
R1QLLIVFLZRGN8,"it does a wonderful job at displaying a beautiful array of stars on the ceiling with multiple colors, however all fur on her zebra falls out."
R1QLLIVFLZRGN8,maybe its just my product but it definitely shows why its cheaper.
RD6GUQBB7JIRZ,granddaughter loves it
R2BLA01ZBWZHND,very soft and cuddly.
R2BLA01ZBWZHND,my grandson loves it.
RXVATL9ZNIUGX,so much fun!
RXVATL9ZNIUGX,"my kids have fun messing them up, and i have fun solving them, so its become a game."
RXVATL9ZNIUGX,"i have broken the 4x4x4 twice by dropping it on hard floors, and can fix it easily with no loss of movement."
R9ZGFFNB6MW96,"ive only had a chance to play once, but it was a game ill sure to play more of."
R9ZGFFNB6MW96,"it was easy to learn, but once my group gets it down it will be very competitive."
R4B3RIN87V1FK,dont waste your money!
R4B3RIN87V1FK,bake real cookies with him her.
R4B3RIN87V1FK,my daughter pestered and i caved against better judgement.
R4B3RIN87V1FK,it literally took 30 seconds to make the mush.
R4B3RIN87V1FK,"the cookies, which the directions say should cook in 1520 seconds was a lie."
R4B3RIN87V1FK,we had to keep putting them in because they were this malleable half cooked &34 cookie&34.
R4B3RIN87V1FK,"i think overall, i must have put them in the micro at least 5x for 20 seconds each, if not more."
R4B3RIN87V1FK,even then they never quite got to cookie status.
R4B3RIN87V1FK,she ate one and claimed the rest tasted like popcorn.
R4B3RIN87V1FK,"i think it was her way of saying they were gross.now, i didnt have high expectations for this product anyway."
R4B3RIN87V1FK,"normally , we just bake our own."
R4B3RIN87V1FK,this product just reiterates why we do.
R4B3RIN87V1FK,easy bake oven meets micro.
R4B3RIN87V1FK,i like the lightbulb cookies better.
R24QAGJBU0C9FU,worked well beyond what i thought it would do.
R24QAGJBU0C9FU,great range and maneuverability
RX5GW1EQM925E,my son loves this tractor he is 2 years old and we bought this for his 2nd birthday.
RX5GW1EQM925E,its easy enough for him to drive and the battery lasts a long time.
RX5GW1EQM925E,its also very good quality and even has a working fm radio which suprized me!
RX5GW1EQM925E,the only think that was a bit confusing was the instructions they have a page of just pictures on what you are supose to do and the writen instructions which use complex names for the small parts and there is no page that tells you what all the small parts are called.
RX5GW1EQM925E,it took us about an hour to get it fully assembled because we had to figure everything out by looking at the pictures.
RX5GW1EQM925E,even though the assembly was a bit rough the look on my sons face when he seen it all together made up for it i do recomend this tractor
R3OOW67OYVRS28,lovely large marbles
R2E9DLZW44OWX3,really cute but doesnt actually kick in the water.
R2E9DLZW44OWX3,my son got this as a birthday gift as a bath time toy.
R2E9DLZW44OWX3,"it is fun to play with but doesnt ""swim""."
R2E9DLZW44OWX3,it floats in the water but it cant seem to kick through the resistance of the water.
R2JKASQQZQQMZ,must have figure.. i love it!

R19W9ZXQ6KJZE7,this was my first nendoroid and i could not be happier with the one i picked.
R19W9ZXQ6KJZE7,naturally i had my doubts about buying at amazon but the one i got is definitely real.
R11U6BJ7GDFI6F,"great buy, really nice set"
R12KZTW1DZILV2,"its a neat concept to hatch the egg and a baby is in there, but these are really expensive for the cheap little plastic toy inside."
RUBYPHZJY9QQ2,very pleased.
RUBYPHZJY9QQ2,we were able to inflate it quickly with an air pump.
RUBYPHZJY9QQ2,would recommend .
RUBYPHZJY9QQ2,our little guy lives it!
R3UYRWGFPUAXK1,the game is very enjoyable but also very complex.
R3UYRWGFPUAXK1,ive played it once in three dimensions with five players and a two player game in all five.
R3UYRWGFPUAXK1,"while the experience is great, it takes a very long while and tough to learn."
R3UYRWGFPUAXK1,"unbelievable potential if you could get a roster of five trained players., and still fun if you like the complexity and work this game demands from you."
RCQWZJP3XA1XM,i suck at rock paper scissors but the game is great.
R2OEZOMODGGEUA,good kit for mounting.
R2OEZOMODGGEUA,one of my favorite german tanks of wwii.
R2OEZOMODGGEUA,tamiya is the best in vehicle models.

R17EGLID7C32V6,2 yr old loved them
R1VBVD23GPZW0E,came in a brown bubblewrap envelope.
R1VBVD23GPZW0E,"the cards themselves were tightly wrapped in plastic, as to prevent any moving during shipping."
R1VBVD23GPZW0E,"so that was pretty good.ive just recently gotten back into collecting cards, but in my limited experience the cards did not seem damaged at all, no scratches or bends.here is the breakdown of what cards i received108 total cards7 reverse foil cards 6 pokemon cards and 1 trainer card1 special energy card100 other pokemon cards basicevolutions3 non identical from mixed sets, or with a reverse foil card triples 3 of same card7 identical pairs5 non identical pairs1 non identical quadruplesno rare cards, rest are a mix of common and uncommon."

R3C64K4PFU8K6E,the recipient had loads of fun with it!
R3C64K4PFU8K6E,"we did, too."
R1MCO4P949BUFL,this item is garbage!!
R1MCO4P949BUFL,the kitchen came with about 15 missing pieces and took about 4 hours to assemble!
R1MCO4P949BUFL,i called 5 times to have the parts sent to me and the rude staff kept putting me on hold.
R1MCO4P949BUFL,do not waste your time or money with this crap!

R275GI9LXPLWGN,way coll!
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,"just as with our actual u.s, secretary of the interior currently sally jewell, this rugged outdoorsman &quotplanes fire &amp rescue&quot character oversees so many departments... the bureau of land management, the u.s. geological survey, the national park service, and is a member of the presidents cabinet."
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,"most of the impact of this position is over the western part of the u.s, which is where the movies &quotpiston peak&quot national park is located!"
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,"one of the main jobs of the secretary of defense in the movie is to to warn of fires in national parks, and piston peak is where former world around the globe rally winner dusty crophopper goes to work with numerous other characters to help put them out."
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,"fred willard is one of our favorite actors, and he gives voice to this neat character, modeled after an international scout suv.while there was a seemingly very limited release of this 155 scale diecast with a &quotfire &amp rescue&quot backer, mattel has gone to &quotmotif&quot packaging in 2015, and the &quotpiston peak&quot motif you see in the corner indicates hes part of a collection that includes harvey, linus lines, tractor buck, trudy trailway, winnie, and racer dusty  as opposed to racing dusty in the watg racers series."
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,there is no difference in this model despite the differences in backers.
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,"while im sure secretary of the interior will appear in other fashions theres currently a boxed set of 3 including pontoon dusty and drip, model  cjy26 if youre interested in checking it out, what i know for sure is that hell be under our tree this christmas!"
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,"we have three grandsons now ages 7, 3 &amp 1, and the durability of these mattel models has exceeded our expectations."
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,"we fully plan to box all of the &quotplanes&quot guys &amp gals along with all of our mattel &quotcars&quot models up when the boys are done playing with them, and take them out again for our great grands one day!"
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,"im putting some general info for anyone considering collecting more than one or two of these models in the comments section below, in case youre interested.han one or two of these models in the comments section below, in case youre interested.de ranger, secord, racer dusty, tractor buck, jackson, pack rat, delta, windy wheelchocks, ted yale, fonzarelli, tysonitis, falco, jigsaw 29, kate the corn cob girl, barbara, gordon, bessie c. flywell, piston, jigsaw 36, strut jetstream dusty, roscoe, firebird, colin cowling, harvey, secretary of the interior, trudy trailway, winnie, linus lines, refurbished mayday, roybal, brody, zed custard, and vasquez."
R4ZMI3A7XG5I9,happy hunting!
R3K5GYVTGCAWMX,great toy!
R3K5GYVTGCAWMX,our five year old grandson played with this for hours.
R3K5GYVTGCAWMX,he figured out how to switch it from a car to a dino on his own.
R3K5GYVTGCAWMX,he really enjoyed all of the talking features as well.
R3K5GYVTGCAWMX,so far all of the vtech toys we have purchased have been high quality and have provided hours of entertainment for curious little minds.
RGEJLHZABB9JA,great tool for preschoolers
R2NUHU6WSWIGYS,half the products wouldnt inflate due to holes

R203PUPLTTHFR2,"excellent, albeit, not inexpensive, set that allows your childs inner craftsperson to blossom.numerous projects that should appeal to the creativity, and challenge the skill, of any childifthe child has the patience and ability needed.bear in mind most of these projects require time and forethought and the patience that leads to proper craftsmanpersonshipi worked on projects with both of my grandchildren the girl was enthralled and patient and determined to &34do it right&34... and did the boy child wanted desperately to play with the finished product, but was always looking for shortcuts or steps he could skip.yes, we finally got it right, here, as well but the stress wasnt worth the candlei am hopeful that he learned his lesson and next time will be better, but...."
R1OEATGG6IUB4S,fun card to mess with cancel spell blue and destruction spell black decks
R1422GA49ZWD8D,gave this as a gift and it was a hit!
R1422GA49ZWD8D,"works great, as advertised"
R5KJS0BJ111K9,shipped fast and gets the job done.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,"keeping everything in perspective, this expansion is average at best."
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,do not buy this expansion based on hero and villain bits.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,the quality of production is noticeably less than that which came with the original game.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,"the figures are smaller, and generally cheaper quality."
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,they dont even look to be on the same scale as those in the base game.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,you get very little in regards to extra with this expansion.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,"what you do get is a continuation of the story, which is superb."
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,"i repeat, do not expect nice figures to come with this expansion."
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,they do not mesh well with the base game in regards to appearance.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,"really, theyre quite ugly and cheap."
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,i would rate this expansion with less that 3 stars if based on bang for the buck value.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,i give it 3 because of the story and the story alone.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,"in my opinion, plaidhat put far more emphasis on the box than anything else."
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,the box is functionally useless since youll end up storing all the components with the base game.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,however the box is so pretty and sturdy.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,you almost want to chuck the garbage figures that came with the expansion and repurpose the box for something else.
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,"due to my lack luster impression of quality in this expansion, i will definitely not purchase any more in the series."
R1AJKXVHURPVCZ,you cant sell a product based on a pretty box with inflated reviews....or maybe you can...
R3AO4R7I09YGZK,great expansion really twist the game up and adds new elements to look out for in the game
R40LQY4X3E3DE,never laughed so hard in my life even the stone faced prunes had a laughable roaring good time cant wait to play again the next time my family is together
RYC38CHG2L7DL,it turned up broken

R2YG3RQQZWFTD9,my kid loves this thing.
R1VWTAIVGJ8Z4N,"its adorable, paint has some minor chipping but its still good and the figure is cute."
R1VWTAIVGJ8Z4N,"if youre going for a little desktop toy and are a big fan of sonic like my son is, then youre going to love this."
R2M9EO3JGY7U4N,my son loved building this!
R3O9TPAMXY8422,it can get a bit messy but my daughter is occupied with this sand a long time.
R3O9TPAMXY8422,even my 9 year old son loves playing with it.
R3O9TPAMXY8422,"i will be buying more colors, because now we end up having only purple"
R2YGL70BX5M0I7,"my white chip didnt fit perfectly, and i had to push it hard to get it into the holder, but i was able to close it."
R2YGL70BX5M0I7,it still looks nice.
R2YGL70BX5M0I7,maybe the next chip will be smaller.
R3DLNTXZRDOEY9,son loves it
R270ACP92J0WI1,cute toy.
RHU0E99AXGCCE,ton of fun
R31EAG74RXYADN,girlfriend liked it very much.
R31EAG74RXYADN,attractive qualitylooking coin.
R31EAG74RXYADN,"it has more of a matte finish than the shiny ones, which sometimes look cheap."
RXEUXIA3GN38,it was a christmas present for my grandson.
RXEUXIA3GN38,he was very excited to get it and very it all of the time.
RXEUXIA3GN38,fit him perfectly.
RR7R7M9S03CO6,perfect for small hands.
RR7R7M9S03CO6,great visual and sensory tool
R1XOM1GUBT7D4Q,exactly what was expected.
R1XOM1GUBT7D4Q,good product!
R1OFYBPEWF5476,dont be misguided by the picture the package is relatively small but the puzzle pieces are huge im pleased with this product
R43MXDNXOQ3DY,awesome solo game!
R43MXDNXOQ3DY,easy to play and provides 7 expansions that change up the game play.
R1GW93ZKYFWPHM,good but we miss flicker in the set of tool

R6LYGEGC4ZJNG,good for 8 year old.
R1OOTT15JRGXAL,very cute.
R3D6LJT9NSYGEP,"first of all, let me say that i cannot imagine any cat in its right mind that would allow this horn to stay on for more than five seconds, so just be warned  your cat will not be pleased with this accessory and will want to immediately remove it."
R3D6LJT9NSYGEP,"i bought it for the purpose of taking a few quick pictures since i dont enjoy making my cat unhappy and would advise against thinking your cat should wear this horn for long periods of time, unless you happen to have an extremely laidback cat."
R3D6LJT9NSYGEP,"that being said, this ""evil"" unicorn horn is really adorable."
R3D6LJT9NSYGEP,"it blew up easily and the plastic spout used to inflate it has one of those valves which prevents air from coming back out even if its not plugged, which was definitely handy."
R3D6LJT9NSYGEP,"it also features little ridges on the sides, which im guessing are for the purpose of making the horn look more authentic."
R3D6LJT9NSYGEP,"it was a little tricky to figure out how to put the horn on  evidently youre supposed to put both loops over your cats entire head, with one back by his throat and one underneath his chin."
R3D6LJT9NSYGEP,"at first i put it on sideways, looping the bands over my cats ears, but it didnt stay on at all like that."
R3D6LJT9NSYGEP,"once i put it on correctly it stayed on long enough to get a couple of pictures, even through my cats repeated batting of it  i keep his claws clipped, though, and i could easily imagine it being popped by a persistent cat with longer claws."
R3D6LJT9NSYGEP,"all in all, i got a bunch of adorable pictures and my cat was wellrewarded afterward with treats and affection  im a happy customer!"
R7BBS2UW7207R,"i purchased all 3 of the aurora world dreamy eyes dinosaurs for my 1yearold son, but i ended up returning them for a different set that was machine washable."
R7BBS2UW7207R,"that said, these guys were terrificreally vibrant colors, soft and cuddly, and really adorable."
R7BBS2UW7207R,these were a great size for a baby or toddler.
R7BBS2UW7207R,"recently my other kid has messed up some unwashable stuffed animals by throwing up on them, so i have recent motivation for buying machine washable toys."
R38DVYMBFFANY9,exactly what i was looking for!
R2J5I7BJ2G1F68,they are perfect and came quickly
R3RD2NCGBLQVMU,i was pleased with the product.
R1X2IGB7I79PG5,"its pretty awesome honestly, and made in poland."
R1X2IGB7I79PG5,the chess pieces themselves are strong and seemingly well crafted however the lock and hinges on the board itself are cheap and could easily break.
R1X2IGB7I79PG5,i dont recommend this for a child but rather adult use only so that it can be taken care of properly.
R1X2IGB7I79PG5,i can see this beautiful board breaking rather easily or even the dots on the tops of the queens which were glues on.
R1XVMEO8O5WIKQ,i received the kids revolutionary war deluxe colonial tricorn hat and it is such a cute hat.
R1XVMEO8O5WIKQ,"it says it is perfect for ages 514, but it fit my head perfect so adults could also wear it."
R1XVMEO8O5WIKQ,it is made of a quality felt material and has a gold trimming around it.
R1XVMEO8O5WIKQ,"this would be great for halloween, school plays and school projects."
R1XVMEO8O5WIKQ,the hat arrives in a plastic bag to leave dust off of it.
R1XVMEO8O5WIKQ,this is a durable hat and i would recommend it.
R1XVMEO8O5WIKQ,i received this in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
R1Y8NBFH3E54FG,product arrived with the rear wheel assembly broken beyond repair.
R1Y8NBFH3E54FG,"the parts 32 spst8550n were shattered, causing the drive axle to swing around freely and mar the rest of the frame."
R1Y8NBFH3E54FG,"the nondrive rear wheel only one wheel is actually connected securely enough to the axle to drive it was loose on the axle, apparently caused by one of the retaining washers having been broken."
R1Y8NBFH3E54FG,"as a warning to other users, the assembly used looks prone to breakage  about 14&34 of plastic retains a larger 2.5&34 diameter molded plastic splitwasher that attaches to the axle."
R1Y8NBFH3E54FG,"if any portion of that cast plastic washer develops a crack, it will fail and tip the tractor when the axle swings free.its a good thing i didnt even let my boy see this, let alone ride it he would have been crushed at our taking it away and seriously hurt had he tried to ride it."
R1Y8NBFH3E54FG,"im glad i caught it within the amazon return window and read some of the other reviews on here about the tractor being too small, it sounds and looks like the tractor isnt for our boy."
R2NML4341VQU1S,nice floaty that folds up nice and easy.
R2NML4341VQU1S,perfect for the boat!
R2QB46VYO8ZHK7,love it
RYD72CHA5K78X,works great
R2AIGIH1EW7BY5,do not buy!
R2AIGIH1EW7BY5,"wings fall off, engines fall off."
R2AIGIH1EW7BY5,cheapest made crap.
R2AIGIH1EW7BY5,sad item
R2NNNJPH2Q9JHM,"cute, but one of the toe ribbons came off almost immediately."
R2NNNJPH2Q9JHM,"also, they are flimsy, as you would expect from costume shoes, but perhaps a bit too flimsy even at that."
R38MQ696F0265L,got this for my son.
R38MQ696F0265L,he didnt like how it didnt come with a leather hand strap and was pretty upset.
R38MQ696F0265L,so i had to hot glue gun and jimmy rig one myself.
R38MQ696F0265L,but he loves it now that i put a hand strap in it like the one thor uses.
R1VPYTU5ZX7D6O,this was a birthday hit for my sons 4 year old birthday!
R3QKC8IXR0KTBK,"after one or two rounds of the game, the questions become known to everyone."
R3QKC8IXR0KTBK,probably the point to encourage sales of followup card sets.
R1O4HS761OAITR,broke almost immediately
RFMK39YBMDYEZ,"shocked at the quality for the price very disappointed, not at all what i expected"
RMMA6WPAE9DWI,looks way better than it works.
RMMA6WPAE9DWI,has a loud musical accompaniment to a difficult to control bubble stream.
RMMA6WPAE9DWI,"sometimes it works, sometimes not."
RMMA6WPAE9DWI,beware that this will cause frustration with most kids and adults!
R3MIT7RV1H6S4,in the tool box
R3MYGL2SJ6CPCZ,bought this first and got a farely nice super rare card that paid for the whole thing.... unfortunately that led me to drop another $100 on more packs in which i got nothing.
R3MYGL2SJ6CPCZ,case is nice for the dice starage.
R2CSE8WH0UULCY,"prompt delivery, quality of material is not great but the kids enjoyed them."
R3OH21DMGVQONS,a fun game
R26HJATWDNG95M,great product  use as a base for my childs duplo and am sure they will last long enough for the transition to lego.
R26HJATWDNG95M,would definitely buy again.
R1D16AJA65YWJ6,excellent!

R1V5G0P4ZFM421,great quality.
R253RTRE7VCIGS,"my husband is very ill and can do little else but paint by numbers, he has done many in the past few years, but this one came out the best by far."
R253RTRE7VCIGS,the recipient of this painting was very pleased with it and so very proud that his grandfather took the time to paint it for him.
R253RTRE7VCIGS,he is an adult grandson and it was a very special gift to him.
R253RTRE7VCIGS,"just to let all know, after mounting on stretcher bars, we wet the back of the canvas with a very wet wash cloth, let dry for about an hour or so and like magic the wrinkles and or folds are gone, mainly because the actual canvas is fabric and it will shrink as it dries, husband has done at least a dozen of this brand and this system always works."
R253RTRE7VCIGS,try it you will be pleasantly surprised...
R11TQKHW5UIZ79,i love it!

R2HAM7PMA748CA,holsters actually hold his blasters so thats pretty darn cool.
R2HAM7PMA748CA,"his articulation is good but slightly limited by his pauldron and kama, but thats just nitpicking."
R2HAM7PMA748CA,helmet isnt removable but he is still a sweet purchase.
R23L3XHDHDABFN,fun for the kids!

R33K03XJWQHDEY,she loves moving the balls around and watching me put them in the circles.
R33K03XJWQHDEY,it helped keep her quiet on a 4 hour plane ride.

R3TS3098GW0Y48,"at the first sight, it shows not much difference with my cyclone boys speed cube."
R3TS3098GW0Y48,but it is really a very fast speed cube.
R3TS3098GW0Y48,my boys love it and they can play it like pro.
R3TS3098GW0Y48,"with a price of $10.86, it is a very good deal."
R1NPND1OOHNCNT,love
RXZJYLSR68ZR7,i was rather disappointed with this.
RXZJYLSR68ZR7,"when i received it, it was full of bubbles, so the sand cannot move around much without getting stopped by thousands of bubbles."
RXZJYLSR68ZR7,it really takes away from the relaxing movement that i was expecting.

R1HJ8XKRJV4R06,what a fabulous allin1 plane.
R1HJ8XKRJV4R06,"its fast, it flies floaty and slow, it lands in grass using dubro 3 inch superlight foam tires, it has the panic button so you feel comfortable to try new stunts with burning up your wallet."
R1HJ8XKRJV4R06,i have a dozen planes and this is by far the most versatile of all.
R1HJ8XKRJV4R06,"it went together well, and it flies well."
R1HJ8XKRJV4R06,the only drawback so far is the restriction to use the 2200 mah battery only....any other larger size will prevent the centerofgravity from being balanceable.
R1HJ8XKRJV4R06,"but, i get 7 minutes of flight time at midthrottle."
R25PYD7R0S731Q,love it
R38G4341AMCFY,lots of work to put together  had to adjust one of the wheels to fit properly
R2AINCEVVTV2BJ,"i thought it came with the plaster to ""dig"" them out but its just loose fossils, which are cool, but i think ill try to find something to ""bury"" them in for my kiddos amusement."
R1BT8HQKLDG9IM,"the colors were impressive however, the consistency of the paint was such that it smeared, it didnt paint."
R1BT8HQKLDG9IM,the result was like trying to paint on wax paper.
R1BT8HQKLDG9IM,the box of paint is a total discard  it isnt usable for anything at all.
R1BT8HQKLDG9IM,"when even an infant finds it useless, you know you have a problem.perhaps my batch was defective?"
R1BT8HQKLDG9IM,im puzzled by the other good reviews.
R1BT8HQKLDG9IM,this was unusable.
R223MIKJJPHBI3,i used it for a birthday party and all the guest loved it.
R3OFRP7MYPYQD2,we got a tube of 50 for our 4th of july party.
R3OFRP7MYPYQD2,i went through at least 45 of them to find 1012 where all 3 colors worked.
R3OFRP7MYPYQD2,"blue section seemed particularly unreliable in our batch, but some of all colors failed."
R3OFRP7MYPYQD2,this was despite careful handling of the unopened tube once it arrived at our house and no apparent damage as well as feeling the crunch of the breakage in sections that did not light up.it would have been better if i had ordered shorter single colored tubes and matched up working ones of each color....
RKSUST8V3ALA3,lots of fun to be had with this classic toy.

R1IM9A48JFTIHA,nice learning toy.
RYQU334DDNFEU,grand daughter loves it!
R2IVAI604GUH1L,horrible product!
R2IVAI604GUH1L,"the balloons fill quickly, but they do not seal, causing the water to leak, rendering them useless!"
R2IVAI604GUH1L,"which is a terrible inconvenience when you have a flock of teenagers, excited, and ready to have a water balloon fight!"
R2IVAI604GUH1L,do not buy this product!

RSF8R11CMGW1H,this jump o lend was great fun for my twoyearold granddaughter.
RSF8R11CMGW1H,"it is not very wellmade though, and the bottom of the jump alene got a leak so i guess it goes in the garage until i figure out how to fix the leak or throw it away."
RSF8R11CMGW1H,if you wanted something thats a lot of phone for shortterm this is a good product but dont expect it to last.
RSF8R11CMGW1H,they need to make the bottom sturdier my twoyearold only weighs 25 pounds.
RSF8R11CMGW1H,a word of caution once the bottom part springs a leak it deflates very quickly... my granddaughter jumped in and hit her head on the floor so make sure you have the carpet or thick pad under the jump onlene.
R3DJ1GALVQ94UP,absolutely great model with many little details to shine up your collection!
R2JUK4HTN7SWIQ,my lessnerdythani family loves this game.
R2JUK4HTN7SWIQ,"the game is easy to learn, fun, and takes around 30 minutes for a small group and maybe 45 for a larger group."
R2JUK4HTN7SWIQ,"im a bit biased about the the games designer, ""richard garfield"" because he also created one of my favorite games, magic the gathering but you wont be disappointed if you pick this up for your gaming collection."

R2VWKU5OIRTW7X,the chrono bomb action game is such a fun game.
R2VWKU5OIRTW7X,"the goal is to complete the mission before the clock runs out without touching any of the ""lasers""."
R2VWKU5OIRTW7X,"set up is easy, find a sort of enclosed space and then set up the string to the sensors."
R2VWKU5OIRTW7X,"then get your mission ready, and go through without setting off the lasers."
R2VWKU5OIRTW7X,this game definitely gets the adrenaline going.
R2VWKU5OIRTW7X,it is also a way to be active and have fun.
R2VWKU5OIRTW7X,it is perfect for children who are fans of spy kids and home alone.
R2VWKU5OIRTW7X,the fun can be increased with download of the app as well.

R37LPOGDMID8M0,moving this any distance is a hassle while inflated.
R1RO7EJ8BEAEGN,"this puzzle was difficult to put together because the base pieces were mostly the same shape and they all fit together, whether they were supposed to or not."

RRMWY9T189YJ8,it looks slightly different...the bottom of his face is more narrow giving him a slight alien look...but its is gaara so for the most part im happy.
RRMWY9T189YJ8,arrived early and in good condition
RRWPPI8O7IS0C,great materials nice and heavy!!

RU8AGPJSNAV6B,great product!
RU8AGPJSNAV6B,my kiddos love them!
RHYV41MRFU0SX,"after 18 months of steady use, this is still a favorite of my sons!"
RHYV41MRFU0SX,"very soft and snuggly as a robe, and very cool for play, particularly for dressing up like star wars heroes."
RHYV41MRFU0SX,"it launders well in the machine cold water wash tumble dry low, and still looks new after 1 12 years!"
R1OPBZGQ6CCXZ7,excellent
R3UDX7HDATAM9P,crayola makes decent pencils for coloring.
R3UDX7HDATAM9P,i wish these had finer points.
R2N3LVT6URE7HT,my son loves trains and these are the cutest!
R2N3LVT6URE7HT,i especially like how they make noise and are very well built.
R2N3LVT6URE7HT,definitely not a junk toy!
ROEFUT4CQMNK4,not worth it.
ROEFUT4CQMNK4,we had two both are duds.
ROEFUT4CQMNK4,great concept but doesnt really work.
R2O0WT863VKE5I,my boys love it
R92W5Q05WE992,if you like or love minions then this is a nice sticker pack loaded with a ton of stickers and 75 minion tattoos.note that many of the stickers are rather small.
R92W5Q05WE992,"see the photo i uploaded.my 8 year old almost 9 doesnt have much interest in stickers anymore, but for a younger child these would be fun to &quotdecorate&quot things with, like artwork or school stuff."
R92W5Q05WE992,they might also be good for teachers of young students... perhaps to stick on their work or use as rewards.
R92W5Q05WE992,the tattoos are for ages 8 but the stickers are 3.overall 4.5 stars and rounding up to 5.note i was sent a free product sample for review.
R92W5Q05WE992,i was not paid or told what to write.
R1ULCG8PVGATJP,"i dont usually bother writing reviews, but we had such a blast playing this game that i wanted to pass it on!"
R1ULCG8PVGATJP,"its a little confusing at first when you have a bunch of people who have never played before trying to figure out the manual, but we got the hang of it by learning as we played."
R1ULCG8PVGATJP,"the only drawback, i found, was that the haunt kept starting too soon."
R1ULCG8PVGATJP,"you have to make a haunt roll every time an omen card comes up, and its hard not to beat a 1 when youre rolling six dice."
R1ULCG8PVGATJP,"i suppose its possible to come up complete blanks on the haunt roll, but i would have liked to have a little more exploring before the game reached the second stage.we played three rounds yesterday, with the haunts being chess against death, the ghost bride, and the elder god."
R1ULCG8PVGATJP,"i found the first two haunts very nicely balancedthe heroes won both times, but juuuuuuust barely."
R1ULCG8PVGATJP,"the elder gods stats are just way too high to beat, but we had a whole lot of fun trying.i thought this was a perfect balance between the easy randomness of clue and the rulesintensive complication of rpg gaming."
R1ULCG8PVGATJP,"we had a full six players for most of the games, and id guess that if wed played straight through instead of stopping to get snacks and check the barbecue and everything else, each game would have taken about an hour."
R1ULCG8PVGATJP,"it can be violent in an imaginary way and it could be scary for little kids, but i think anybody who has graduated to reading books like &34goosebumps&34 could probably handle it easily."
R3HFD4RXE5YFIQ,good quality!
R3HFD4RXE5YFIQ,!
RTO7X1477251W,thanks!
R8KUE0EBR0B4L,a okay

R385XRQL37IU0Z,have this displayed in my room and i like it but she kinda looks creepy in person.
R385XRQL37IU0Z,but i still love it and is well made.
R1DNC2FSNBTMCT,the figure itself is very well made incredible craftsmanship on the modelers part.
R1DNC2FSNBTMCT,"the translucensy in her hair is a nice touch, the packaging was great, and it arrived right on time... from freaking japan."
R1DNC2FSNBTMCT,this was a stellar buy.
R19MQ57WS5LW4M,"these are cardboard, but they are sturdy."
R19MQ57WS5LW4M,"we put beans and beads in them, and my daughter loves it."

RBZ2CEF6QST03,grandson loves them and they stack nicely against the wall  dont take up a lot of storage space
R263I7OZBOGOZN,purchased for my 12 year old son.
R263I7OZBOGOZN,he could never get it to work and tossed in about a day later...
REHP6ZGTLA43A,these are perfect for my sons play pen.
REHP6ZGTLA43A,just a side note you might want to buy 2 sets because 1 is pretty small and youll end up ordering a second set like i did.
RIGFTPOO1PKJV,great
R32E467IRPRVN6,"the only word that comes to mind when describing the air hogs shadow launcher is ""awesome""."
R32E467IRPRVN6,i was given the opportunity to sample this product and review.
R32E467IRPRVN6,wow am i impressed.
R32E467IRPRVN6,i have 2 boys 5 and 10 and both of them absolutely loved this toy.
R32E467IRPRVN6,i may have to purchase one to alleviate the fighting at my house.
R32E467IRPRVN6,the item seems durable for the few days we have been playing with it and battery life seems normal for this kind of toy.
R32E467IRPRVN6,overall i am very impressed  i would definitely recommend purchasing this item
R1VC0PXBBC7JP,fun....
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,this is a great set for the price.
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"as long as you know up front that you arent getting lego, youll be happy."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"i wouldnt spend the $100 on the equivalent lego set, but this price was right in my wheelhouse.here are my thoughts, the good and the bad, in no particular order."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,there is no box.
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"the pieces come grouped into smaller bags, much like lego, inside a larger bag."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"lego boxes immediately go into the recyling bin anyway so i didnt mind, but if you are giving this as a gift then its something you may want to consider."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"most pieces are virtually identical to lego, but certain things like steering wheels and the minifigs are different."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,the colors for some yellow are also different than lego.
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"not worse, not better, just different."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,the instructions are the same as lego.
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"ive read some criticisms that the instructions are poor, but they look exactly the same."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"in fact, one issue i have with legos instructions are that i often have trouble telling whether a piece in the instructions is light gray or dark gray, and sluban is the same way."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,the plane is surprisingly long!
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"its easily over a foot long, and some of the extra things they include are pretty cool silverware and food."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"not sure if lego includes this, but i liked it."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,"it also includes a brick separator, which i thought was a nice touch.if youre considering this, give it a shot."
R2OGF9NVIFDHN4,ill definitely buy another sluban set.
R25XMKNO0MSEZ6,would be awesome if the credit cards worked.
R296OY11W58JCU,"its a cute, soft toy as billed."
R296OY11W58JCU,bit small for kids.
R2MDUXHXJ4H548,cute for goodie bags.
R2MDUXHXJ4H548,not super high quality but good for what it is.
R2H2004T38M79I,great!
R376JLXZ8AC28T,very nice.
R376JLXZ8AC28T,arrived on time.
R22C4N600HWYRF,"the toy is ok, but i didnt expect it to be so small."
R22C4N600HWYRF,"yes, the description says 4 inches, but i didnt read very carefully and at this picture it looks much bigger."
R22C4N600HWYRF,"so, i presumed it will be as big as these toys were when i was a kid.so, because of the very small size the toy is not standing up on soft surfaces like carpet or blanket, or any other soft surface like on the picture... and thats where small kids are usually playing, not a concrete floor, right?"
R22C4N600HWYRF,"i could even put only 3 stars for the confusing created by the picture... but the toy is still ok, just be careful with your expectation and read the description when you buy something."
R31SQQZIW96D9X,my animated 4 year nephew is a visual learner and loves this tool.
R31SQQZIW96D9X,"has dates, days of the week, seasons and even how hes feels day to day, which is mostly grumpy in the mornings."
R268I3KQXDAODS,i bought 2 pkgs.
R268I3KQXDAODS,of these to add to goody bags for my sons minion birthday party.
R268I3KQXDAODS,i was very pleased with the quality.
R268I3KQXDAODS,they worked fabulously & were a big hit with kids & adults too.
R268I3KQXDAODS,"for the price i wasnt expecting them to be very durable, but they were much more sturdy than other similar items we have previously purchased at party city & other party goods stores."
R268I3KQXDAODS,my kids still pull theirs out to wear 2 months after the party.
R268I3KQXDAODS,i think we may get more for a harry potter party coming soon.
R268I3KQXDAODS,d
R2D8VBR632PLE9,"didnt work, had to return it."

RLUG0K5KQ5LQD,"ive been buying lego ""city"" items for my oldest grandson now 6 for quite a while now."
RLUG0K5KQ5LQD,"he loves legos, and this is no exception."
RLUG0K5KQ5LQD,"very wellmade, durable, etc."
R2W00VUGOHWO0O,awesome power wheels that my little guy can operate with no problem.
R2W00VUGOHWO0O,"my son has tried 3 different power wheels 2 atvs, fire truck and he always seems too not like to press the button with his thumb."
R2W00VUGOHWO0O,this has a pedal and more natural for him to operate as a result.
R2W00VUGOHWO0O,so whats that mean?
R2W00VUGOHWO0O,20 mins of nonstop cruising around the neighborhood!
R2W00VUGOHWO0O,easy set up albeit a little more involved than the atv and fire trucks as there are about 4 plastic parts you need to attach to form the handlebars.
R2W00VUGOHWO0O,one thing i didnt like is the 18 hour charge time  ill deduct .5 star for that youd think these things would come fully charged by now given the cimplaints.. oh well4.55 stars rounded up to 5
R3O45WOO2EIX11,"if you cant afford the big one, this is a excellent second choice!"
R29LJ693V0GYRO,my daughter & niece loved these dolls.

R3AB5RA1P0R8RQ,good price.
R3AB5RA1P0R8RQ,great product.
R3AB5RA1P0R8RQ,this is the second one that i have bought and this was the best price.
R3KP9RNHDN4J5X,a few pieces were glued with pieces offset and a one had smeared paint.
R3KP9RNHDN4J5X,those were a bit disappointing.
R2Q43QB0AH61EL,great game
R120V739WYXMDW,thanks

R3MJI80APASSXG,we lost the shoes quickly but besides that she is perfect!
RLQUS7HL8BBSQ,texas hold em just isnt the same without poker chips.
RLQUS7HL8BBSQ,"the poker chips in this set are a good weight, very durable."
RLQUS7HL8BBSQ,and theyve got that great sound you want from your chips when they hit the pot.
RLQUS7HL8BBSQ,"the cards arent the greatest, but i have a twelve pack of bicycle decks so im all set."
RLQUS7HL8BBSQ,"the case is a great size, weve taken this set on multiple vacations and it isnt inconvenient at all."
RLQUS7HL8BBSQ,"incredible value for the price, although you probably wont be playing with more than two or three people unless youve got more chipsyou buy more.one star off because these are pretty cheap chips, and so there is some odd dusty residue on them even though they come wrapped in plastic."
RLQUS7HL8BBSQ,"i suggest wiping them down like we did, it feels a lot better afterwards."
RLQUS7HL8BBSQ,also probably eliminates some nasty toxins.
R3KUOY8UBRWR42,the quality of this item is poorly made.
R3KUOY8UBRWR42,"i saw missing velcro on the banana, also crack on the apple."
R3KUOY8UBRWR42,the only good thing is it ship on time.
RB0C9RTIQFZE2,bought this for my son for his 3rd birthday he loves it.
RB0C9RTIQFZE2,my dad put it together hes the one with all the tools.
RB0C9RTIQFZE2,pretty sturdy.
RB0C9RTIQFZE2,my son is pretty big for his age 40inches tall and 40lbs it doesnt seem its going to break and he sits in it with plenty of room.
R3GGA7X49T9IB9,great gift
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,"we love one night ultimate werewolf, and this expansion fully playable on its own gives us more reasons to love it."
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,we have all the cards in one box and mix and match most of the time.
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,"when we show the game to new people, we start out with the basic set of cards for a few rounds."
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,"then we start throwing in cards like the apprentice seer, mystic wolf and witch and explain those roles."
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,"i like the revealer, who looks at a players card and turns it face up unless that player is a werewolf, in which case the card gets turned face down when im the revealer i like to announce who i am before we open our eyes so no one thinks i just see the card and lie.lying is a major factor in this game, and it takes a little while to get the hang of it."
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,"its supersimple, too basically, the villagers everyone but the werewolves win if they shoot the werewolves in gameplay, this simply involves pointing fingers at them , and the werewolves win if they dont get shot."
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,"310 players you can play more with expansions, i guess, but the most weve played with so far is seven."
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,three players is ok but i really prefer a minimum of four.
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,"but if only three people are around, ill always play."
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,the game is best played with the companion app for cell phone or tablet placed on the table.
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,"in the night phase all players close their eyes and perform the actions of their character, as bidden by the voices in the app."
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,background sounds can block out the sounds of people swapping or otherwise moving cards around.
R2AOZDWR1VPX0A,then in the day phase you wake up and start trying to figure out whos who and see if any werewolves are going to get killed or survive.i was in on the kickstarter for the upcoming one night ultimate vampire game and am looking forward to adding those cards to the lineup.
R36IGY4V5HST4M,definitely not worth the price.
R36IGY4V5HST4M,spend $10 more and get something a bit more sturdy.
R36IGY4V5HST4M,the strings broke after 5 mins and that was just with me testing it out!
R36IGY4V5HST4M,"they show all of these lovely colors and i got the normal ""natural wood"" color....."
R3BQKL1PN76LKR,i just love the bobble heads.
R3BQKL1PN76LKR,i am clerical in an office environment and the staff is having a contest that has a baseball theme.
R3BQKL1PN76LKR,the bobbleheads just added the finishing touch to the atmosphere.
R3BQKL1PN76LKR,i am so glad that i found them on your website.
R3EX37LX8DO2OB,received item.
R3EX37LX8DO2OB,"once taken out and blown up, one floating will not stay inflated."
R3EX37LX8DO2OB,material is very thin.
R2X5FYH2SRGH6K,wonderfully well made joe spencer halloween edgar allen crow.
R2X5FYH2SRGH6K,a lot of detail was given in the making.

R2X5FYH2SRGH6K,love it.
R3SUWQ5EG35JR0,"the butterfly is pretty, but i guess we had expectations for it to do ....something."
R3SUWQ5EG35JR0,it does flap its wings.
R3SUWQ5EG35JR0,maybe thats all a butterfly toy is supposed to do.
R3SUWQ5EG35JR0,my daughter is actually scared of it.
R35KHLZJG1RKQN,this was a huge hit and the young dr. who fan played with it for hours and built his halloween costume around it and around a burgundy bowtie also purchased on amazon.
R1FY44K8I0OJGN,its a good card for a defenderwall deck
R1DBBVWS4S149D,it was exactly what it appeared to be and what i wanted.
REV677ZZ74KRB,great set at a good price
R2UEN7WF02I6SV,what i received was not at all what is pictured.
R2UEN7WF02I6SV,"this would never fit a child firstly...it is too big on my adult head with a big curly wig on, and the crown i got was opaque pink and not translucent white like it should be and how its pictured."
R2UEN7WF02I6SV,"it was also smashed completely flat to fit into its ""packaging"" which made permanent creases in the sides of the crown, making it more football shaped and not round like pictured."
R2UEN7WF02I6SV,if you need a quick crown for glinda its fine i guess if you dont care about accuracy...its very cheap though and youll have to augment it to make it fit.
R38DMZ2SPFK59K,"cute lamp, but it seems to get hot after use."
R2QDNZYVEX9X14,any parent familiar with the rescue bots line for over a year is by now frustrated with how flimsy the toys have become.
R2QDNZYVEX9X14,"when my son was first introduced to the line it was the energize series that was sturdy, large, and actually transformed."
R2QDNZYVEX9X14,"like its recent counterparts, high tide is a poorly designed and made knockoff of what a great rescue bots toy should be.the instructions were confusing in that the pictures did not always match how the toy is actually made."
R2QDNZYVEX9X14,the decals also did not all match the numbering indicated.high tide himself only folds in half and the cardboard cutouts of servo and cody will be lucky to last more than a day.
R2QDNZYVEX9X14,"decals are already peeling, and platforms that are supposed to slide will fall right off.if your kids went crazy over the new recruits like salvage, blurr, and high tide then they will love having this transformer to add to their collection."
R2QDNZYVEX9X14,otherwise just pass it up and buy them one of the new star wars playsets from the same playskool heroes line.
R3879GIC7TD41T,"she loves it, but....i think ive given my niece a new weapon."
R3879GIC7TD41T,i recall loving this kind of thing as a kid too.
R1AGZ2TNO6R5P9,funny card mainly just to mess with people.worth the dollar
RSFSSE3B0J42,so pretty.

RX601MZL63GFZ,thanks to the sellers for prompt shipping
R2V81KNE324HRF,i dont recommand to but this toy
R25MMIMC8IVMRN,great game for two
RQJ0MK01LJCZS," the stones arrived in plastic bags, which were inside the bowlsthe bowls themselves were situated in the carrying bag."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"once they were washed & oiled more on this below, they were lovely & had a nice heft."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"the opacity of the black stones when held up to the light was variable, but on the board they are uniform in color."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"i received at least 7 extras of each color, with only one broken stone."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"the bowls are pleasant enough i would prefer solid wood, but wanted my limited budget to go toward maximallysized stones."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,the bowls hold the stones with a little room to spare & seem solid with wellfitting lids.
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,as ive just received them i cant comment on any issues with cracks forming between the pressed strips although ive no reason for concern yet they seem perfectly sound.
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"the bag is pragmatic, although the sideloading feature is clever, with a simple thick fabric square sewn into the bottom to keep the bowls from rubbing against one another."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"a nice touch is metal feet on the bottom of the bag, keeping the bottom from additional wear."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"of all the elements, the bag seems most likely to expire first, but im confident thatwith reasonable handlingthat shouldnt be a concern for some time."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"washing & oiling the stones as is mentioned on the yellow mountain website, & a number of other gorelated fora, yunzi stones come in a protective powder & must at least be washed before they can be used."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"after washing & drying thoroughly, it is recommended that one oil the stones both for aesthetic reasons & to protect against the stones scratching."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"it is important to use a nondrying oil, such as sewing machine oil, so that the stones do not become gummy vegetable oils, for example, are not to be used for this very reason."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"once the stones are oiled, & the excess rubbed off, they have a beautiful matte luster."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"the process can take a couple hours, but it is most definitely worth it."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"verdicthighly recommended the price is a bargain you pay less for bamboo bowls, but get more stone mass for your $."
RQJ0MK01LJCZS,"expect to invest a little time & effort before theyre ready to play, but expect also a nice payoff in the end."
R3MZR7F6NBUSJ0,so small
R3UGHMDZDCFDRT,this product is so much smaller in real life than it is potrayed in the picture.
R3UGHMDZDCFDRT,if you truly are looking for jumbo blocks as the name implies then this is not the product for you.
R3UGHMDZDCFDRT,it only has the rectangle blocks so it limits building options.
R3UGHMDZDCFDRT,"in short, this product is wack, dont get it."
R1JYQFFPKGJ4M1,the kids love it
R3GTF5EQ9TUKDK,love it
RJJNDEE9CIU9C,such an amazing product!
RJJNDEE9CIU9C,my son and i have had lots of fun playing with it.
RJJNDEE9CIU9C,works really well.
RJJNDEE9CIU9C,only problem i have is that it is extremely hard to get all of the putty off of the magnet.
RJJNDEE9CIU9C,i think it would be better if the magnet was packaged in a plastic wrap instead of directly with the putty.
R106TEKB1JE233,good starter kit for my 10 year old who loves card tricks.
R106TEKB1JE233,"most of the tricks are pretty easy to learn, the hard part is spending the time and effort to practice so they really do look like magic."
R106TEKB1JE233,"but if you are prepared to put in the time, this is a good kit."
R1VTTFIO5A1X23,do what they need to!
R1GE23E6DXWPTS,these spinners are pretty sturdy and fun to watch.
R1GE23E6DXWPTS,i have four of them now in the backyard.
R1GE23E6DXWPTS,they will fade and crack a bit so dont expect them to last for years and years.
R1GE23E6DXWPTS,easy to assemble and adds to the yard.
R36YEEX534ENHX,"great bey, cant be beat!"
R1KOKW5P8X8ZDQ,thank you very very much for this!
R1KOKW5P8X8ZDQ,it was an awesome birthday gift for a long time friend.

R1KOKW5P8X8ZDQ,thanks you very much!
R36Q50XUVDQ6L9,"so cute, perfect cupcake toppers!"
R20L2WUFW0KZK1,my 5 year old nephew loves it!
R20L2WUFW0KZK1,it was definitely an eye catcher at the star wars themed party because of the size!
R20L2WUFW0KZK1,he was so excited when he opened his gift!
R20L2WUFW0KZK1,the only problem now is he and his younger brother fight over playing with them!
RLBQJIX6Z6AUX,"perfect foundation for vampire deck, this card came in great condition and was pretty much new"
R12UKSZJ9CRDCB,was surprised it was only 8x10 on regular printer paper.
R12UKSZJ9CRDCB,fit great on top of the photo booth basket after i glued it to poster board.
R2ZAWH6S58X8JJ,very pleased.
R2ZAWH6S58X8JJ,nice addition to my fairy garden
R1E3M9VZHVX5Z4,"great party game, always good to have around when youre with your friends."
R248Z341R1A,wonderful!
R1WAGUYPD31M9W,too short!!
R1WAGUYPD31M9W,mine pop out of the yoke anytime the truck cartwheels.
R1WAGUYPD31M9W,i have adjusted the yoke as far out as possible.
R1WAGUYPD31M9W,"yesterday the outside pin popped out, sliced through 50 of my a arm... lasted about a month of just casual bashing."
R1WAGUYPD31M9W,also they use set screws on the output shaft of the universal instead of the current setscrewpin design.
RL9165S7128D8,i gave this as a birthday gift to a 2 yr. old & he loved it.
R3E8SM8ZQZSCCI,good for price
R2BCDUKIV55J0,loved it

R2O8UUBLL5R1AU,i bought this toy for my 4 month old and it is officially one of his first toys to grab onto with one or both hands its great fun to watch.
R2O8UUBLL5R1AU,we also brought it on vacation with an 11month old and she went bananas over it and would not put it down.
R2O8UUBLL5R1AU,love it.
R1ZM65LPNGBH46,this is a great addition to furniture for the doll house
R238IL87F9Z2GW,"nice toy, do not expect instruction to assamble it there are some basic, however if to have fun assamble"
R35V0BFY23PLLA,this is a daily toy in our home!
R35V0BFY23PLLA,"the tractor fits on the wooden tracks brio, ikea as well, which is awesome."
R3JR77R18KAWMR,"its super cute and good quality, but they spelled &34birthday&34 wrong... i opened it up and it said &34happy birtdhay&34 mixed up the d and the h... we thought it was hilarious and it actually ended up being a funny addition to the party theme, but if thats something that would bother you, then this review might matter to youall in all it was very cute and well made minus the spelling error"
R1X71WO6UJ1AFS,does the job and keep the cards neat.
R1X71WO6UJ1AFS,separate velcro adjustable walls.
R1X71WO6UJ1AFS,high quality
R1JD2JC509B403,looks just like the picture.
R1JD2JC509B403,no complaints.
R3K315C1YE382A,"awesome buy, great christmas gifts at an affordable price."
R3K315C1YE382A,thanks so much
R38G9LCZFD72RS,daughter is very happy
R2BQUDRISII26K,really cool.
R2BQUDRISII26K,size medium fit a 10 years old girl which use 1012 size with room to grow.
R2BQUDRISII26K,minus 1 star because the boot cover for shoes run small no way to make it cover the shoes and theyre attached to the pants.
R1MI9NM0ZZXEQ2,each piece doesnt stay on very well.
R1MI9NM0ZZXEQ2,it split couple times in order to complete the whole piece.
RYLXMLPKBOVF8,these things are gigantic!
RYSX3GL3U1H4F,i bought this game for a charity event at my childrens school.
RYSX3GL3U1H4F,it went into a young readers small gift basket for k1st graders.
RYSX3GL3U1H4F,apparently it was a big hit because it helped raise $50 at the auction.
RYSX3GL3U1H4F,i would buy it again at higher level for my now 1st grader.
RYSX3GL3U1H4F,seems like a fun way to help kids learn their sight words.
R6NTKPBFXMI19,product stopped working within a month i ordered it... i wish i could get my money back...
R1EC61TLGKT1PE,"this is absolutely, handsdown, my 5 yearold twin daughters favorite game.their older brothers love to play mine craft, but it is far too difficult for five yearolds and the boys wont let them near their cities anyway!!"
R1EC61TLGKT1PE,!my daughters have really enjoyed building their cities and decorating them with their very own style and flair!there is a lot of subtle education here.
R1EC61TLGKT1PE,"for example, when the players are able to paint and decorate their buildings, they are displayed as a flattened version of a 3 d figure that would be folded up."
R1EC61TLGKT1PE,"there is a lot of geometric reasoning that goes on.the quests keep things &34competitive&34 for task oriented children, and players can choose to clean up or not clean up their towns.this is a game in which i have to set some clear time limits with my girls or they would literally play all day!disclosure i was given a copy of this game to facilitate my review."
R1EC61TLGKT1PE,"however, as always, all opinions are my own."
R2PRCGKCV5ULG0,this is perfect for a toddler just learning to walk.
R2PRCGKCV5ULG0,"its fun and sturdy and once my little guy got the hang of it, he just boosted himself up and there he went wall to wall across the room."
R2PRCGKCV5ULG0,"wed turn it around for him and laughing away, there he went again."
R2PRCGKCV5ULG0,"my coworker recommended this to me and going forward, ill recommend it to everyone as well."
R383X8YEQOQU38,works great.
R383X8YEQOQU38,you can charge multiple batteries at the same time.
R383X8YEQOQU38,the reason some people report it taking so long to charge if you put more on it is because you need a usb source that provides a lot of current.
R383X8YEQOQU38,if you use an ipad charger which can provide 2a then you can charge several at a time in the same short time as you could charge one.
R383X8YEQOQU38,but if you use a generic iphone charger which is only rated for 500ma and actually only puts out less then it will take 3x as long if you put on 3 devices.
R2V90B0K7WI6OF,they to small
RBM0Y0J5WFOVG,daughter loves it thanx
RM881OZSB4RN,"nice size, perfect for a 24 year old, highly recommended"
R1RC75IKJP8YY0,couldnt blow all the way up.
R1RC75IKJP8YY0,as soon as you quit blowing the air would be 13 of the way out.
R1RC75IKJP8YY0,so always somewhat flat.
R2D6RJS83976V8,i received this as part of the bzzz agent campaign and i can say that we did enjoy the product.
R2D6RJS83976V8,i was a little weary on the fact that it advised to have hair pulled back while using it but we have t had any incidents so far which is great.
R2D6RJS83976V8,it charges bery quickly with a usb which is very convenient and it take a little practice to make sure the fairy doesnt crash all over the place but i will say we all had fun trying to get the hang of it.
R2D6RJS83976V8,my daughter is 6 and she got the hang of it pretty quickly.
R2D6RJS83976V8,we will more than likely be purchasing another one for our step daughter as well!
R307MEMBQSRYMD,grate
R27SHCEELIZG2B,used her for a product display in the hair salon.
R27SHCEELIZG2B,she got alot of attention!!!

R27SHCEELIZG2B,!
R2CWHTSDFA4WD4,it was good
R3E93TQIXZOZWK,awesome game
R1QKPY4LVAQXAA,i may have bought this a little too late.
R1QKPY4LVAQXAA,"i think if i got it when my girls were a little younger, it would have been a bigger hit."
R1QKPY4LVAQXAA,i put it together myself and i didnt do the best job.
R1QKPY4LVAQXAA,my fault.
R1QKPY4LVAQXAA,i think!kids use it occasionally and use their imagination to make it other things like a drive through.
R1QKPY4LVAQXAA,prob prefect for kids aged 25
R18XL15HUKFCIH,very happy with purchase
R2AV78U1X597SU,"this sloop 226"" has given me more pleasure than anything that i have purchased on amazon."
R2AV78U1X597SU,it is so well made that i would have paid 5 times the asking price.
R2AV78U1X597SU,a real beauty.
R2AV78U1X597SU,"the sails go together in a snap, even a land lubber could put it together."
R27FD76Q8XG7SJ,good quality.

R1BRL73PWR6J0Z,!
R3MEDW6VJKFK6L,great size but never figured out the ribbon mechanism.
R3MEDW6VJKFK6L,not a reflection on the product but more the excitement of the children waiting to see what was inside!
R8VOU7A2A0705,great packaging.
R8VOU7A2A0705,we have been waiting for just valentine for quite sometime.

R1A7RFC87Z30U0,love these!
R1A7RFC87Z30U0,have bought four.
R1A7RFC87Z30U0,i am a youth pastor and we use these for everything.
R19U44JZGARAHL,"cute set, but once you take everything out of the bag you cannot put it back in."
R19U44JZGARAHL,the rake is very cheaply made and seems like it will break easily.
R31MO68LCVRFMB,i cant say enough good things about this mat.
R31MO68LCVRFMB,it is perfect for my daughter to play with her schleich figures on.
R31MO68LCVRFMB,"it is a very low pile carpet with a well done layout of horse farm with stables, grooming station, jumping arena, pasture and lots of scenery like grass, trees and ponds."
R31MO68LCVRFMB,it is flat and stable enough that her animals can stand up on their own but better than the hard surface play mat she has since she can sit or kneel on this with out it breaking and without it toppling all her figures.
R31MO68LCVRFMB,well done schleich!
RVQR3A36YCWTE,good
R3RQGMEDSR6FMZ,beautiful pop!
R2MPP0D1G6YCVL,its hard to find snake stuffed animals.
R2MPP0D1G6YCVL,this one was perfect for my friends young child who is fascinated with snakes and whose favorite color is blue.
R2MPP0D1G6YCVL,"its not too realistic looking, yet is identifiable as a snake."
R1BREIQELLVG1A,good deal good price
R37RVFK21AB9HL,these are super thin.
R37RVFK21AB9HL,i bought them for a construction themed kids party.
R37RVFK21AB9HL,i wrote each kids name on the front with sharpie.
R37RVFK21AB9HL,then they could put stickers on if they wanted.
R37RVFK21AB9HL,they enjoyed it but the hats got beat up pretty easily.
R2HPS4RV053HCF,perfect size ..fun
R92RCUQLXLC1Z,came quickly as promised.

R237AD54A7WKWK,"and if youre a collector, fan of titans, or just a simple breaking bad fan, get this!!!"
R237AD54A7WKWK,!
R2Q1Z1O515DCC6,great product at a very fair price.
R1XZYIZRYUH0Z,loved it and was a perfect fit
R3OXL03ZVKKFUU,i cannot wait to give this to my husband for christmas!

R3OXL03ZVKKFUU,i know it is for children but i think that he will have just as much fun with it!

R1IOHAZJUOX0UV,"its sturdy, great quality for a toy."
R1IOHAZJUOX0UV,"even has a comfort grip, which i thought was a funny feature for a 24yearold."
R1IOHAZJUOX0UV,"i love that the handle is adjustable, so it can last a few extra years as my daughter grows."
R1IOHAZJUOX0UV,"wheels are rubbery plastic, so it doesnt seem like they will ever crack or break."
R1IOHAZJUOX0UV,the material doesnt feel cheap.
R1IOHAZJUOX0UV,"i browsed through many, many doll strollers before deciding upon this one."
R1IOHAZJUOX0UV,im very happy with my purchase.

R18TI8Y1CZHKJ7,i received this product at a discounted price in return for a fair and honest review.
R5WARSYNOWF0H,we are using this to store dress up clothes and it is just perfect.

R1S80PNGEHCB6,"fun, fun fun for baby."
R1S80PNGEHCB6,"my 6 month old grandson loves to do tummy time on this, he tries to bite the fish."
R1S80PNGEHCB6,"or sometimes he just sits on it with my supporting him of course, he tries to grab at the fish in the water filled base of the turtle."

R1S80PNGEHCB6,having been using every other day when i babysit and no leaks so far!
R2BGVFWWQ0EM5N,my grandson loves this beyblade!
R1F04EQUVCXQI4,ok
R1GIM22DY09Y28,like the product will buy a nother
R1NTK7VVVW76V2,this is heartless!!!
R1NTK7VVVW76V2,dont you people know that scotlands national animal is a severely endangered species?
R1NTK7VVVW76V2,do you know that illegal farms have been created in wales to breed these majestic animals for slaughter?
R1NTK7VVVW76V2,they are only fed food containing 10 rainbows!
R1NTK7VVVW76V2,"the rest is made of low energy white light, and they are never let outside to frolic in wood, but kept in a muddy barn."
R1NTK7VVVW76V2,"this is what society has come to today, you people make me sick."
R1NTK7VVVW76V2,think before you eat!
R2Y06MSQI8DAG1,purchased for a family event.

R2Y06MSQI8DAG1,no tools required.
R2Y06MSQI8DAG1,simple app download to get started.
RFSBBFLVYKYPU,this was a very great toy it comes with every you see on the box
R2U4CDF54L2HYQ,due to design defect the little doors sometimes cannot be closed by the baby.
R2U4CDF54L2HYQ,you need to make sure to reposition the switches back to the original position.
R2U4CDF54L2HYQ,but ultimately its a toy which does amuse a 6 month to 12 month old baby quite a bit.
R858D9PBEHRTB,very satisfied with item.
R858D9PBEHRTB,fast delivery and ease of purchase.
R858D9PBEHRTB,would recommend.

RXS0AV0DWYLK9,well done and came in quickly.
RXS0AV0DWYLK9,im so glad i found both her and gallade.
RXS0AV0DWYLK9,my boyfriend loves this duo so even though its not an official plush by the pokemon company its so well made.
RXS0AV0DWYLK9,my only beef with this is that what material was used to make it.
RXS0AV0DWYLK9,i hate it.
RXS0AV0DWYLK9,"i dont know why but my sense of touch cannot, i repeat, cannot stand the fabric."
RXS0AV0DWYLK9,it sends me up a wall and i have to drop it.
RXS0AV0DWYLK9,ugh good thing its going to my boyfriend and not me haha.i will change it to 5 stars if he loves it!
RPP4OCOK1IIKM,everything was as promised.

R31D45HDQD6FE1,"i recall energetic sessions at the dining room table im sure i had no idea what a ""stock market"" was at the time, but it was still fun."
RDWYWRPBJU4FA,this puzzle kicks so much butt.
RDWYWRPBJU4FA,i purchased this for a pacific nw beach weekend figuring it would rain at least one day.
RDWYWRPBJU4FA,this puzzle captivated all the 30 year olds... the sea creatures are awesome and all the black space makes it difficult to keep it interesting.
RDWYWRPBJU4FA,highly recommend.
R3UW5NSSL89959,it was so much fun looking at my friends face when she saw the box.
R3UW5NSSL89959,great for a good small prank.

R2WL3E1XJR40NO,loved it!
R2FABHOP8SR5KV,all the nieces and nephews had a great time playing this game.
R1T9CL47RUF3TL,you like tsuro?
R1T9CL47RUF3TL,well you will like this one just that much more.
R1T9CL47RUF3TL,"it adds a lot of replay value with the seamonsters that change the board, and potentially making a longer, and more filled game"
R203DPP3ACJDZW,great thanks!
R3GRRUCSUBMMC0,this slide is terrible.
R3GRRUCSUBMMC0,"like all of the other 1 star reviews, regardless of your water pressure, water only shoots out of some of the holes on one side."
R3GRRUCSUBMMC0,we ended up clipping the left side tube pretty close to the hose connection so that water shot pretty high out of the first 2030 holes or something like that....made the slide usable on a slight hill.
REYHYRZXIQKKY,large mickey balloon had a large slice in it
R1TCXG7WW69AEF,excellent....
R412PJR3X5FX2,its an elmo plate!

R3UNLK9PV8K19C,great assortment for the price
R2QZN9WL7YT92S,to be hones this is an amazing toy.
R2QZN9WL7YT92S,"i didnt know what little people were, but i stumbled upon it while i was looking for toys last year and my daughter got it for her birthday."
R2QZN9WL7YT92S,this thing is cute and lasting.
R2QZN9WL7YT92S,she tends to throw the dolls out of it and ride in it herself and surpisingly it hasnt broken yet.
R2QZN9WL7YT92S,she loves it and recently added the arial carriage to her collection of little people toys.
R3FMXNUFLBFLW0,this kit has good detail but was missing parts when it came
R37Z4HJ5V3GAGC,great and timely delivery
R357IMIDOUXF81,my bay does not like this

RPSQHJV6VTWEV,so soft!
R1P8MQI1D9G8LT,its great
R3N9BZVNT8VSZN,this is a cute little puzzle that offers a good little challenge for the children.
R3N9BZVNT8VSZN,i gave it four stars because the only thing was disappointed in was its size.
R3N9BZVNT8VSZN,i was hoping it would be larger.
R3N9BZVNT8VSZN,its about the size of a small board book.
R3N9BZVNT8VSZN,"a bigger puzzle would be great so that the manipulatives could work out better for little fingers.disclaimer i received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
RTNCTVXBSIWS3,cute.
RTNCTVXBSIWS3,but thats not a mask but instead it is painted on.
R3NESY0TBJQARU,i bought them for my niece!
R3NESY0TBJQARU,she loves them!
R341ZD4R09POI4,great blow up pool net.
R341ZD4R09POI4,just make sure you have a place to tie it up too as a slight breeze will blow it around.
R1CN2299QIFBO1,white styrene sheets just what i was expecting.
R1CN2299QIFBO1,will use these on building scale model ships.
R2BYK52W4R09BY,this game arrived promptly and in excellent condition.

R1CLDZA18M1PAL,a great way to get lots of colors!
R1CLDZA18M1PAL,"crayola has good quality items, and this is no exception!"
R6V4W8UGJPORC,this has been a great backpack in terms of size for our kindergartner.
R6V4W8UGJPORC,"there are 2 compartments, one is big enough for change of clothes, water bottle, other miscellaneous items library books etc.. the other main compartment is big enough for the lunch box to go inside  the back and forth homework and school papers folder."
R6V4W8UGJPORC,the backpack is big enough to accommodate these items and i like that it doesnt come down to my sons ankles  perfect size for a 5 year old or smaller student who isnt hauling textbooks back and forth every day.
R6V4W8UGJPORC,"plus, i absolutely loved all the designs."
R6V4W8UGJPORC,i do wish there had been more design to choose from for boys  there were only 34 with 15 for girls.
R6V4W8UGJPORC,"lastly, my son has only used this backpack for the first week of school, so i cant attest to its staying power and long term quality."
R6V4W8UGJPORC,it is only for those 2 reasons i give it 4 stars lack of boy designs and not sure how long it will last.
R6V4W8UGJPORC,so far so good.
R2KAMX8W6M1T9A,"met all requirements, just what i asked for."
RB1C0F2ADO2Q6,was hoping this would be a good adult rehab for people w cva.

R1JF30Z1FU1TGA,"i love this wooden piggy bank, i will put my change in there."

RHFJLJATVAEGK,"paw patrol is currently ""the"" brandseries of the season and our kid testers are huge fans."
RHFJLJATVAEGK,"needless to say, they loved playing with these imagicards themed around their favorite cartoon characters."
RHFJLJATVAEGK,this is compatible with recent leapfrog tablets not leappad1.
RHFJLJATVAEGK,we played this game with the leappad platinum.
RHFJLJATVAEGK,it worked great!
RHFJLJATVAEGK,"the graphics were cute and colorful, just like the toys and cartoon."
RHFJLJATVAEGK,these cards utilize the camera in the leappad.
RHFJLJATVAEGK,focus the camera on one of the cards to unlock games.
RHFJLJATVAEGK,"this paw patrol set includes the game download, 33 cards featuring 6 characters, a play mat and my personal favorite piece a tin to hold the cards in when youre not playing with them."
RHFJLJATVAEGK,"this game focuses on math skills, like number recognition, counting, shapes, patterns, additionsubtraction and number sequences."
RHFJLJATVAEGK,"overall, this is a very engaging way to play, especially for those kids that like a physical object to bring them into a digital worldgame."
RBU07DR0XJRHI,super adorable!
RBU07DR0XJRHI,"fun and easy build, great for beginners."
R27N08JBVCAYCY,"have the animals, now have the family."

R378EE5SKCJNJI,not at all what i thought i was purchasing!
R378EE5SKCJNJI,i purchased this for my ten year old little girl.
R378EE5SKCJNJI,"shes always talking about wanting to build a robot she actually wants to build a battlebot so, i thought this was a good place to start.....we were planning to use this as a science lesson for school."
R378EE5SKCJNJI,this thing is a joke!
R378EE5SKCJNJI,"the ""robots"" are very tiny like microbots, even she cant get the prices to got together properly with her tiny hands."
R378EE5SKCJNJI,and the packaging was all messed up.
R378EE5SKCJNJI,this is not a good gift for a child.
R3UNEKEANYXAZL,went on road trip 10 hours each way with grand daughters 9 and 10. once we started playing this game they didnt want to stop.
R3UNEKEANYXAZL,when we would stop to eat they took with us to play.
R3UNEKEANYXAZL,i think i love this game as much as them and im 52. bottom line its a great family game
R1DCJLXAG6MSPN,this bounce castle is exactly as described.
R1DCJLXAG6MSPN,perfect for kids!
R1DCJLXAG6MSPN,"and while i wouldnt suggest that adults jump in it, there was no problem for two full sized adults to crawl in with a young child."
R1DCJLXAG6MSPN,"our daughter loved it.came with the blower fan, a carry bag that was actually big enough to store the bounce house, and a bunch of plastic stakes to anchor to the ground."
RS8EG6RYK9GNR,"cute party accessory, plan to place it over a small tent for kids play tent at a backyard carnival themed birthday party."
RS8EG6RYK9GNR,"would be cute as used as intended, hanging over a birthday party table suspended from the ceiling?"
R6IV14HZ4QIMN,the game is a great game for adults who wanna do something fun but dont necessarily drink though drinking does add a certain level of fun to the mix and im glad i finally got my own set
R256CWD9G6UZNR,these are absolutely adorable!!!!

R29WT5ZW8G6NLX,i am writing this review as a buzz agent.
R29WT5ZW8G6NLX,bzzagent  i am part of a bzzcampaign which receives products and then writes reviews on them.
R29WT5ZW8G6NLX,i received the paw patroller as part of the campaign.
R29WT5ZW8G6NLX,i have a 3 year old and a 17 month old who love the paw patrol series.
R29WT5ZW8G6NLX,upon its arrival other than stickers needing to be pit on it was ready to be played with.
R29WT5ZW8G6NLX,it is made of sturdy material with minimal moving parts which makes it easy for the small child to play with and there is no choking hazards.. it makes various sounds which make it sound like an actual truck and base for the paw patrol team.
R29WT5ZW8G6NLX,it came with an action figure and an atv which the kids loved.
R29WT5ZW8G6NLX,"i only give it 4 out of 5 stars due to the actual price and having to put the stickers on, which although a diagram and easy to place, should be already in place so as to unpackage and go go go for the paw patrol fun."
R383MOHO02HBU2,you dont have to be a d&d fan to enjoy this game.

R19AAJRIP1IYTP,would not buy.
R16A43ZKRHX7NR,"this is the new version where you dont use the plastic pliers to remove the crocs teeth, you just press down on the tooth."
R16A43ZKRHX7NR,i love that because now my children cant lose the teeth!
R17VY7OCE0KR5T,necklace was broken when i received it at the clasp.

R1T1JP54XKFRZX,i wanted to send them back as soon as i opened the box but they charge you to send it back so its not worth it.
R1T1JP54XKFRZX,i wasted my money on these.
R2M3ZQ621PG8ML,delivered quickly!
R2M3ZQ621PG8ML,original fit.
R2M3ZQ621PG8ML,looks like new.
R2M3ZQ621PG8ML,easy installation with a wrench and vise grips.
R2M3ZQ621PG8ML,flip gator over completely and place vise grips on center of the axle to prevent it from spinning as you remove axle nut.
R2M3ZQ621PG8ML,thanks
R69T0HBB06VNS,got this for my daughter as she loves this kind of craft stuff to do.
R69T0HBB06VNS,she loves making all the bracelets of all sizes and colors.
R69T0HBB06VNS,"she loves all the colors, charms, she also loves that the loom is big so she can also make necklaces, rings, and anything she can think of."
R69T0HBB06VNS,"we also love that it comes with lots and lots of bands, so she can make all the bracelets, necklaces, etc she wants."
R69T0HBB06VNS,if you have someone that loves to make stuff like this then i highly recommend this as they will have hours of fun.got this friendly bands sunshine loom deluxe craft kit for free for my honest and unbiased review.
R3SRZHVWQW0IQV,"didnt even come with 48 i didnt count them originally, made about 40 cupcakes and there were only 32 of them"

R25N7CP5NAA6W9,hes 18 mos.
R2CTRXT4B4DPOC,"theyre fine, because theyre frozen so my daughter loved them, but they were hard to remove from the backing and i had to help her."
R3NXXRUIB4YR13,awesome!
R3NXXRUIB4YR13,wish i could afford the more expensive one with lights!
RK79DQX2UEADX,very colorful and my daughter loves it!
RK79DQX2UEADX,it was a nice suprise that even the zipper had a rainbow tint.
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,"dont get me wrong, the figure looks great!but it has some basic flaws that make me wonder if it was intended to be taken out of the package.first, like another reviwer, i noted that once a weapon is removed from its place on him in my case, the gun from the &34holster&34 its nearly impossible to put back.second, the reason i tried to put the gun back, his hands dont hold the weapons well."
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,"the gun sort of hangs in his hand limply, as if hes in the process of dropping it."
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,"the grip of the sword hilt is also too small for his hand, and hangs very loosely.third, his ankles are loose."
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,this makes it very hard to stand him up.
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,he keeps falling because his feet slowly bend upward.
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,"ive spent a fair amount of time looking for the sword and gun, because he drops them as he falls off the display shelf due to his weak ankles.other than that, my only complaint would be the hip articulation."
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,its pretty basic.
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,"the rest of the articulation is pretty good, but these days i expect hips and shoulders both to have ball joints, for better positioning."
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,"if i could get him on one knee it would solve the ankle problem.overall, i do like the figure."
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,"ill come up with solutions to the problems, but wish i didnt have to."
R2U7RPYBAHWBK1,"my ultimate goal is a deathstrokedeadpool display, with them holding a sword in one hand and gun in the other, pointed at their counterparts face."
R10BANJ2MC5Z9O,one step changers are a great way for younger kids to have transformable figures that change in seconds.
R10BANJ2MC5Z9O,"this bumblebee basically folds up into robot mode, then folds back into vehicle mode with only a couple movements."
R10BANJ2MC5Z9O,i prefer the colors on this model more than the previous version which was a lot of yellow.
R10BANJ2MC5Z9O,to see my full review check out
RWTG7U35R5E0,"adorable bear, great quality & the 1 minute recording is nice & clear."
RWTG7U35R5E0,my husband is in the nursing home.
RWTG7U35R5E0,"i cant be with him all day & the cnas often tell me, ""he was missing you today, he was calling for sweetheart""."
RWTG7U35R5E0,i finally got the idea to look for a recordable stuffed animal so he could listen to my voice when im not there.
RWTG7U35R5E0,"after reading the reviews & checking them all out, i believed this to be the best one."
RWTG7U35R5E0,"once i got it, i felt certain of it!"
RWTG7U35R5E0,"the cna told me today that my husband was holding the bear to him & listening to it & he responded to my voice by saying, ""i love you""."
RWTG7U35R5E0,i call it the sweetheart bear.
RWTG7U35R5E0,"this bear comforts my love when i am not there, & that comforts me."
RWTG7U35R5E0,i think this bear is worth its weight in gold!
RWTG7U35R5E0,this is one of the all time best purchases that i have ever made!
R2YH1ZSJK1SN74,much harder to learn than we expected.
R2YH1ZSJK1SN74,would only recommend playing in a group when 2 or more players have already played the game.
R1KUIBFZWK36HS,i was disappointed in the quality of this toy and the instruction sheet.
R1KUIBFZWK36HS,we returned it.
RJVAICL72IGMD,deminsions said 8x10.8 x .08 inches!!!

R2XG0DMCYUCYFS,i had no idea this would become such a huge hit.
R2XG0DMCYUCYFS,it was a gift for my 3 year olds birthday  she plays with it sometimes.
R2XG0DMCYUCYFS,"her 4 year old brother however, plays with it daily."
R2XG0DMCYUCYFS,the magnets are strong so they are easy to link up to make things.
R2XG0DMCYUCYFS,we started by trying to make the objects in the ideas book that comes with the set together.
R2XG0DMCYUCYFS,that was neat to see for both of us.
R2XG0DMCYUCYFS,"then my son started playing independently with it  he makes rocket ships that he zooms around the house, trains he drives around the floor, houses, robots, etc."
R2XG0DMCYUCYFS,in other words  it is an excellent imaginationstimulating toy.
R2XG0DMCYUCYFS,open ended play.

RH5KAV5AZRPJ1,melting time is at least 5 minutes for enough chocolate to make 3 tiny pieces of candychild got impatient early on and shes 8 and a rather patient child.
RH5KAV5AZRPJ1,"she needed a lot of assistance to do thischocolate melted very quickly after being taken out of the freezer, even in the baggie that was givendifficult to get the chocolate to completely fill the mild perfectlyoverpriced for the flimsy plastic being usedprosget to spend a lot of quality time with your childyour child gets to work on hisher patienceyou dont have to use a stove or microwave to melt the chocolatecomes with little plastic bags and tags to give chocolate away as a gift my daughter got excited about thiscute molds"

R2186FSAU1HHWC,"it is pretty and she loves it, however, just a warning...it does drag the floor which i knew before i ordered, but what never entered my mind was the fact that she and her cousin sometimes step on it while she is walking and it chokes her ."
R2186FSAU1HHWC,it may be more suitable for older kids.
R2186FSAU1HHWC,im cutting off the extra and heming it up so she can still play with it.

RUNXKQQ6X72PK,"i received 4, 2 had the same pony in it and 2 had beeds, one of the two beeds containers one came with 4 beeds and the other one had 1 in it."
RUNXKQQ6X72PK,and nothing in it to make a braclet with so it sucks.
RUNXKQQ6X72PK,i wouldnt buy it again.

RGX95SIDFI28G,feeling a bit of nostalgia i purchased this as it was the closet i could get to the version of monopoly i played as a kid during the 80s and 90s.
RGX95SIDFI28G,tokens are pretty similar to what i remember.
RGX95SIDFI28G,i was worried id get tokens that i didnt remember due to some complaints i read here but these are close to what i had as a kid.
RGX95SIDFI28G,"i got the dog, top hat, thimble, car, wheelbarrow, boot, cannon, iron, cavalry and ship."
RGX95SIDFI28G,"the cards are a thinner card stock than the older sets, but im okay with it."
RGX95SIDFI28G,if you dislike it i bet you could laminate the cards.
RGX95SIDFI28G,"the flimsy money tray of old is gone, this molded plastic is a vast improvement!"
RGX95SIDFI28G,"there are newer rules i dont remember like mortgages, but you can still play the old school rules if you want.overall i am really happy with it and recommend it for others who want to recapture a classic"
R38GMUVG5THCHJ,we received the paw patroller as part of the bzzagent campaign.
R38GMUVG5THCHJ,"my little guy was head over heels for this ""big truck""!"
R38GMUVG5THCHJ,we found the large pieces easy to manipulate with little parent assistance.
R38GMUVG5THCHJ,"one downside is that the truck tends to tip over easily, even with it opened up correctly."
R38GMUVG5THCHJ,"that really didnt stop my son though, he had an absolute ball."
R38GMUVG5THCHJ,"there were two stickers that came with the truck that we couldnt find a place for, but it didnt affect the playability of the vehicle in any fashion."
R38GMUVG5THCHJ,we will definitely be purchasing additional vehicles to go with this for christmas.
R3SDCXU32LL2R3,a collectible for me.
R2QI1Q63V74A8E,"got this for my daughter for xmas last year since she loves fashion, is a whiz on her ipad and it had great reviews in a parenting mag.she was happy to receive it but its been a whole year and its still on her shelf."
R2QI1Q63V74A8E,guess it didnt have that much appeal after all?
R2QI1Q63V74A8E,i dont know.i know i have to assist her so ill get it out soon and post an update.it seems like a cool concept.
ROJQQW2AL14BL,"i recommend this product, good quality for the price."

R27ZA37H01A0LS,i love it!!
R27ZA37H01A0LS,super awesome!!
R27ZA37H01A0LS,my only issue with this was the painting...everything is perfect except her hair.
R27ZA37H01A0LS,the colors splash over onto each other.
R27ZA37H01A0LS,kind of irritating since i paid more than what i could have got through amazon.
R27ZA37H01A0LS,but regardless its a must buy for any harley fan out there!

R17G9GE4D8XSTS,includes familiar character andrea and another mini doll as well.
R17G9GE4D8XSTS,"only complaint is that there are too many stores in lego world bakery, cafe, mall, salon, pet salon, etc."
R17G9GE4D8XSTS,and id like to see more variety.
R1UV03ZS31AY1F,my son received this for his 10th birthday and loves it.
R1UV03ZS31AY1F,"it took a few hours to put together, and it is one of his favorite legos."
RBT5RVM3YUMQ5,"this is a fairly high torque servo at a reasonable price that is a great replacement for the stock, garbage, non waterproof servos that come with most ready to run rc products ."
RBT5RVM3YUMQ5,i installed these on several boats that have become completely submerged several times and continue to perform flawlessly .
RBT5RVM3YUMQ5,i run my boats pretty hard and these have performed extremely well .
RBT5RVM3YUMQ5,these rc companies give you their flashy labeled low cost garbage with a high tech name that starts to fail in high humidity.
RBT5RVM3YUMQ5,"this has a proven track record with me , i recomend this for a variety of rc applications ."
R1N1SJS9LH37A8,junk  do not waste your money.
R1N1SJS9LH37A8,there are 296 stickers total but 200 of the smaller ones are hard to remove and did not stick.
R1N1SJS9LH37A8,there are only 4 pages of stickers  very expensive  can not believe i spent almost $6.00 for them.
R3UKAXSCYRGDMH,"they were nice puppets, except the mouth stays open all the time, which is a little spooky for 7 and 8 yr. olds."

R1JA4UGBH3NLMI,"it is very nice and soft, i gave it to one of my friends as a gift and she is using it to decorate her office"
R3AGUDYOQ4X2SJ,very poorly made binder.
R3AGUDYOQ4X2SJ,"the inserts are of very high quality, and would certainly buy again, but the binder... damn."
R3AGUDYOQ4X2SJ,id be willing to wager that any binder from dollar general would be of better quality.
R3AGUDYOQ4X2SJ,"do yourself a favor and buy a good one from somewhere else that accepts inserts in the frontback, then just print pokemon photos that you can use as a cover sheet."
R3AGUDYOQ4X2SJ,my 6yr olds binder started coming apart before he was even done putting cards in it for the first time.
R3AGUDYOQ4X2SJ,i taped it up with large clear packing tape.
R3AGUDYOQ4X2SJ,"fingers crossed that i dont have to explain this crappy binder to my son anytime soon, but i fear i will."
R2PJV7X0HYGNAT,is great i made two tunnels with it.
R208F1KJEOO4FX,everything was great and nice quality
RL848SL47VZ53,very well made.
RL848SL47VZ53,took bolt out to grease and found brass bearing.
RL848SL47VZ53,also found that the bolt screws into the hinge and the nut is an additional lock for the bolt that really isnt required.
RL848SL47VZ53,lastly found blue locktight for another layer of safety.
RL848SL47VZ53,after applying grease they are very smooth and quiet.
R325MRKWZENDIS,these darts are the best nerf darts available.
R325MRKWZENDIS,they are packaged in 4 packs of 25 as pictured.
R325MRKWZENDIS,these work with most nerf guns.
R325MRKWZENDIS,"if the gun says n strike on it anywhere, they will work.cant really say much more about it, they work good for large nerf wars, but you might not need this many."
R1RPJ36ZODWW2P,so cute!
RE6QRZB0CQQR5,you can never have too many enderman.
RE6QRZB0CQQR5,"and this particular enderman is full of awesome.the arms and head move, and the block can be removed it connects to the hands via magnets, how cool is that?."
RE6QRZB0CQQR5,it has this &34chibi&34 look to it and seems really durable.

R2555WUGMI8SMI,was very disappointed in the poor quality.
R2555WUGMI8SMI,we purchased this about 6wks before his birthday and wrapped it immediately.
R2555WUGMI8SMI,he opened it today and the hot glue that holds the strings to the plastic bar had failed to work on two strings!
R2555WUGMI8SMI,nothing like tears for the birthday boy.
R2555WUGMI8SMI,"because we purchased it early, we missed the cut off date for returning the product."
R2555WUGMI8SMI,we also realized the support bar was broken as well.
R1OUEP5PHW5VXG,these are awesome!
R1OUEP5PHW5VXG,used them for my wedding and put them in a ziploc bag after they stayed filled for over a month!
R1OUEP5PHW5VXG,i actually put submersible led lights in the base of round bowls and filled with these beads and they glowed beautifully!
R1OUEP5PHW5VXG,tip use distilled water for a nice crystal look and do not touch with your hands!
R3DLVNBQYVBC61,excellent first blocks for a baby.

R14ESJN59FPJR8,"my three year old grandson is all about insects, spiders, and ocean life... so of course we had to get the ant."

R28NX0GUABIR7C,awesome assortment of commonly used gears.
R28NX0GUABIR7C,ive already used a couple of them to repair a couple of toys that had stopped working because a gear had split and was spinning on its shaft.
R28NX0GUABIR7C,very handy if youre in to repairing things that use plastic gears.
R2YNMSM52U0KR1,"my son has the thomas wooden tracks and because he wanted more, i decided to go with an offbrand since it is cheaper."
R2YNMSM52U0KR1,this really is not bad for the price.
R2YNMSM52U0KR1,"sure the quality is not great on all the pieces, but for the most part they fit well."
R2YNMSM52U0KR1,"and the battery powered trains do derail, but they also derail on the original thomas tracks too."
R2YNMSM52U0KR1,the biggest complaint from me is that there are no adaptor pieces.
R2YNMSM52U0KR1,i had to order another adaptor set separately.
R2F0O8CQIPRSJY,not as heavy as i would have liked.
R2F0O8CQIPRSJY,i used it for a game to knock down plastic cups.

R36SNBWTL2579J,"the kit had empty bottles, a fake booklet and candy."
R36SNBWTL2579J,this was such a waste of money.
R36SNBWTL2579J,i would not recommend this even if i were a paid sponsor.
R36SNBWTL2579J,emptor cavete buyer beware!!!!

R2S20X541I658T,you can also place it on a table if you want it to pitch even higher.
R2S20X541I658T,its easy to use and the first time my little boy used is truly the first time he has ever hit a ball in the air!
R2S20X541I658T,i received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
R1J74FJQ6RGKY4,awesome toy that allows me to share a portion of my childhood with my son
R2BAD4DJWUCAJY,another relatively bland figure being a bgrade villain.
R2BAD4DJWUCAJY,the arm scythe is nice.

R3KL68TD82KD9Q,"i love how they now make ""girl"" lego sets."
R3KL68TD82KD9Q,my daughter is really into them and even went to lego camp this summer.

R380TEG3K5ZOE4,there is nothing wrong with the part it is just labeled wrong.
R2LCCQN30MUFX0,im not convinced that these are quite as robust as the name brand ones but with that said they perform fantastically for the money.
R2LCCQN30MUFX0,what else can be said?
R2LCCQN30MUFX0,"if you understand that crashing is inherently a part of flying helis especially the smaller ones, and dont restrain your flying style as a result of this these blades will save you a lot of money over time."

RL8SSEMIHH2E8,"cute, received sooner than i expected."
R32VRSK5OUU99T,very good
R268QYQ1KF18FA,good looking fella.
R268QYQ1KF18FA,the color is more of a red wine or burgundy color.
R268QYQ1KF18FA,super soft.
RMZJK865LYIIN,the adora my first baby tee 15&34 soft baby doll is an adorable plush doll for babies 1 year.adora is plush and features a magnetic pacifier and removable clothes.she is machine washable.
RMZJK865LYIIN,"her belly button is a sewn heart.i think this would make a great &34security doll&34  you know, the doll that they want to carry everywhere, have with them at bed time, etc.shes kind of big at 15&34 tall and i think that makes her more adorable and huggable."
RMZJK865LYIIN,recommended!
R2PS0B9HS93A3U,pretzels and beer are my faves  had to have this little lego gal.
R1940CCW0QDEHZ,"i bought this after reading the reviews expecting the legs to leak but they didnt, my sons ages 9,7 and 3 all love this toy and can play with it together plus there is plenty of room to play when they have friends come over."
R260MKFG1C6JHO,"folds compactly and lightweight, so its easy to carry."
R260MKFG1C6JHO,easy to assemble.
R260MKFG1C6JHO,the sandbags on the sides held it in place on the beach even on a windy day.
R260MKFG1C6JHO,perfect for a toddlers nap on the beach.
R2DH1IPUNDHUFK,5 stars for the chomping motion range and sound effects.
R2DH1IPUNDHUFK,0 stars for the stability.
R2DH1IPUNDHUFK,first it wont stand up on its own.
R2DH1IPUNDHUFK,"second, when you pull down the arm to activate the sound and chomping the whole dinosaur curls up on itself and falls over."
R2DH1IPUNDHUFK,my son loves to user the chompers but is constantly trying to straighten the legs so it will stand on its own and is confused why it wont.
R2DH1IPUNDHUFK,also it did not come with batteries.
R3OX11OA3DUHR9,thank you
R36NSFJ9XGV4S6,awesome and deeply appreciated the bonus!
R1UHDT02D1RBRU,"this is the second set of 100 assorted cards i have purchased for my 6 year old son who eats, breathes and sleeps pokemon."
R1UHDT02D1RBRU,"first set was from different seller, which was excellent only a handful of doubles this set however was a huge disappointment, more expensive then the previous set and awful selection, now of course these sets are going to have trainers and doubles but 20 trainers and 24 exact doubles is beyond rediculous!!!"
R1UHDT02D1RBRU,he got just over 50 of what i paid for!!!
R1UHDT02D1RBRU,i choose this set over the other seller based on reviews.
R1UHDT02D1RBRU,worst decision!
R1IA7G6VHX9ZA,fun!
R1YVCATJBSUKQX,unique take on thor.

R29LXHU6O4SWYZ,my daughter loved this!!!
R29LXHU6O4SWYZ,"i was saving it for her birthday but it came in handy when we had been stuck in the house for a few days with summer storms, it kept her and her little sister pretty busy.. it was much bigger than i was expecting which was a very pleasant surprise and the dolls faces on the pages are beautiful!!!"
R29LXHU6O4SWYZ,i would definitely recommend this to anyone whose little girls like to play with makeup and do makeovers...
R2T4485L30RL4M,shes is the perfect doll for my collection since i love alice in wonderland but i do wish she had longer hair to brush and play with but anyway it is a great doll .
R2T4485L30RL4M,they need to make the daughter of the catapiller next .
R2MYKBEKIZ3HU6,usually takes couple tries to catch some bugs with it.
R2MYKBEKIZ3HU6,"still... for catching slow wimpy bugs around your house, its alright."
R1H9R8NW4BZY0R,nicely made.
R1H9R8NW4BZY0R,"seems like such a good concept, but gets very little play."

R33M7U7LMR44HJ,i am very pleased with this cute puppet!
RN6WVC23I2OQX,a must for all moms at the beach or pool.
R74VGPKGRNK2H,daron makes very good models with great detailing and with parts that fit very well.
R74VGPKGRNK2H,the reason i give them only four stars is because of their bases.
R74VGPKGRNK2H,"they could be made a lot nicer, maybe with a wood grain appearance."
R74VGPKGRNK2H,"as they are, they appear very cheap."
R74VGPKGRNK2H,i have more than a dozen of the daron skymark models and over a dozen of the boeing models which come with a wooden base and they look much better on display.
R74VGPKGRNK2H,amazon sells the best variety of these model planes and their prices are directly in line with any other on line sight.
RXMO8I0KUOBNU,its really good the detail is epic and arrived on time the only bad thing with the one i got is that one leg is slightly longer than the other and its somewhat difficult to put the right arm back on
R2GKN5LK9EPZJ8,i got these for my sons birthday party.
R2GKN5LK9EPZJ8,these balloons were great!
R2GKN5LK9EPZJ8,we couldnt get them filled fast enough for the 6 boys!!

RJNPQ204LAUIQ,"in my option, it is one of the best starter games for children."
RJNPQ204LAUIQ,"you dont need know how to read, and you only need to know how to count to 2!"
RJNPQ204LAUIQ,"this game helps with listening, taking turns and sharing."
RJNPQ204LAUIQ,which is wonderful for young children.this game is simple.
RJNPQ204LAUIQ,its a childs version of lcr.
RJNPQ204LAUIQ,the whole goal is to be the last player left with mice.
RJNPQ204LAUIQ,you start off with few mice for each player and a cat bowl in the middle.
RJNPQ204LAUIQ,"with each turn, you will roll your dice and move your mice around accordingly.mouse put one mouse in kittys bowl.arrow pass one mouse to the player on your left.bowl take one mouse from kittys bowl.sleeping cat do nothing.why yes, its that simple!"

R1E7EM9WKHTDB,love it
RJAY332BDR7V6,the quality of the product is ok not great.
RJAY332BDR7V6,the plastic does feel a little of the cheap quality side.age recomended is 3 but i guess its a stretch.without the help of an adult nothing is possible.its a bit tricky as not all the parts fit everywhere and on everything.
RIU3686RMKD1S,this will make a great present.
RIU3686RMKD1S,my sister loves puzzles and dr. sho.

R6SEU3KYEYCXY,"one of six cars in the 2013 pop culture range by hot wheels that were hannabarbera cartoons themed, captain caveman along with the magilla gorilla truck were easily the standouts."
R6SEU3KYEYCXY,this quite a heavy little 164 scale sized car.
R6SEU3KYEYCXY,"i barely remember the actual cartoon from when i was a kid, i remember the hairy little guy used to have some anger management issues and after shouting &34captain caveman!&34 would smash a heap of stuff around him with his wooden club."
R6SEU3KYEYCXY,but this is a cool car and has the character on the sides and bonnet hood.
R6SEU3KYEYCXY,theres also some im guessing dinosaur bones on the bonnet too.
R6SEU3KYEYCXY,the sides along with a tree and some shrubs have a row of red club silhouttes under the front door window and bonnet.
R6SEU3KYEYCXY,hes not on the rear doors but there is a number plate with the words cavey.
R6SEU3KYEYCXY,the car is yellow with a red roof that doesnt have an image unfortunately.the undercarriage is metal and a nice silver colour.
R6SEU3KYEYCXY,the wheels have tyres with tread and nice red rims with sort of bicycle style hubcaps.
R16K2M3R4PZW51,kid liked it
R3F6UVEMWSXGVQ,its a stuffed animals and he loves it.
R594TXAC2B4JB,made my granddaughter feel and look like a real magician.
R35E9G9B66OJBC,"the packaging was damaged bent a little which would normally bother me but for such a small and cheap item, i wont make too much of a stink."
R35E9G9B66OJBC,i have peace of mind just knowing how easy and painless the return or replacement would be with amazon.
R35E9G9B66OJBC,ill just let my daughter think it got dented in santas sleigh.super cute idea for monster high fans.
R35E9G9B66OJBC,they are unique for sure!

R10NEIV1RH7KQ0,i made a mistake and ordered i set of pocket pets and i thought there would be all six in the package.
R10NEIV1RH7KQ0,not one was n there and i gave no idea which one it is.
R10NEIV1RH7KQ0,it does not mention on the package any where the kind of pet that was in package.
R10NEIV1RH7KQ0,buye r dont be fooled
R31WRMXHFTS4J6,i used to have the brand name version of this 30 years ago.

R31WRMXHFTS4J6,kids have played for it every day for the past month they love.

R2H3E1QJ8OUYP9,cushions the cement around the swings.
R2H3E1QJ8OUYP9,"work well, but does blow away on a windy day."
R1DTN8H2O2H2NX,this is a beautiful and wellmade little toy.
RNAXD0QFADP21,"this was a really fun model to build, as well as quite the time sink as it had many very small parts."
RNAXD0QFADP21,"a couple parts may need some model glue to stay in place, particularly the back plates around the waist, but other than that it is the tightest model ive built."
RNAXD0QFADP21,something to be aware of though is that the parts in the image that are shown as a metallic gold are more of a bright orangeyellow in the model kit which i wasnt exactly expecting.
RNAXD0QFADP21,"it showed up at my house about a week an a half earlier than the first estimated delivery day, however the box it came in had a corner crushed right in."
RNAXD0QFADP21,"the model wasnt damaged, but the box was for sure a bit crunched."
RNAXD0QFADP21,"this falls on the shipping company however, not the seller."
RXBHQHSA3XHEJ,perfect!
R1P526LRHGT8YV,waaaaaaaaaayyyyyy too much for this
R1164S18K8HPTM,"our family has tried a few leapfrog products over the years, and we have found it a quality brand that combines education, fun, and quality together."
R1164S18K8HPTM,we were drawn to this leapreader system specifically because of paw patrol.
R1164S18K8HPTM,"my youngest daughter, age three, is all about paw patrol  sheets, backpack, toys, books, you name it."
R1164S18K8HPTM,"her older sister, while not quite a fan, still enjoys the show as well."
R1164S18K8HPTM,"we were excited to give this book a try, and we received the leapreader system in order to try it."
R1164S18K8HPTM,"it was pretty easy to set up, and its pretty awesome, especially for a little one who gets to see a book come alive with sounds and music.the recommended age here is four to six."
R1164S18K8HPTM,"my daughters are three and seven, on opposite ends of this recommendation."
R1164S18K8HPTM,so it was interesting to see them work together on this.
R1164S18K8HPTM,"obviously, they were engaged with the story, which closely follows one of the television episodes."
R1164S18K8HPTM,"my youngest looked at the words and sounded out what she could repeated her sister more than anything, and the eldest went through it quickly, finding it &34too easy,&34 though i suspect she was just showing off."
R1164S18K8HPTM,what is great about this is that my two daughters were able to do something together that held their attention and entertained them.
R1164S18K8HPTM,"i think they got the ages just right, ages four to six will get the most out of this."
R1164S18K8HPTM,"its a bit too &34babyfied&34 as my sevenyearold said, while the younger was entertained and somewhat amazed but not really picking up on the educational aspects."
R1164S18K8HPTM,"still, this seems like a great product for kids interested in reading with technology."
R1164S18K8HPTM,and paw patrol is a real crowd pleaser in our house.
R25PP8Y3IT7SY2,working well adds a little fun to family room.

R1AFTC0591MNCY,weve been doing jigsaw puzzles as an activity with my 97yearold mother and she really enjoyed this one!
R910QULPAOP91,quality materials but the fit of the metal contacts into the plastic connector bodies was quite tight and hard to set in place .
R910QULPAOP91,a person wiith less or no experience will probably damage a few before working around the problem .
R910QULPAOP91,"these connectors come in different amperage ratings and i may have had a mismatched connector body ,contact set  metalod to plasticid  ."
R2GEP97CW48ZHS,my only wish is that this cat was a bit bigger!

R19W8M549VJPJG,great quality.
R6O01IYF4BY9,not bad for such a small quad !my quad couldnt make it for three days  one of the motors didnt move after hitting objects while flying this full of fun toy.
R6O01IYF4BY9,the build quality isnt that &34crash proof&34 if you know what i mean.
R6O01IYF4BY9,prepare your self to buy spare parts including 1 as much as you like to buy of cw motors and ccw motors they are hard to find and they are so damn delicate and hard to fix2 extra frame.3 lots of props.4 4 extra batteries you will thank me for this for sure

R32RD311POLW7G,"aesthetically, this bed is adorable."
R32RD311POLW7G,"quality, you get what you pay forits a $150 bed."
R32RD311POLW7G,im giving it 3 stars due to the painstaking assembly.
R32RD311POLW7G,"some of the pilot holes are completely off, so youll have to drill on your own."
R32RD311POLW7G,"dont use your power drill for actual drilling though, the faux wood will be eaten alive."
R32RD311POLW7G,some of my pieces came scratched and dinged.
R32RD311POLW7G,"overall, it probably took me three to four hours to assemble.however, my son completely loves the bed."
R32RD311POLW7G,it fits his old crib mattress perfectly with no gaps.
R32RD311POLW7G,he can get in and out of it easily the edging at the head ensures he wont roll out.
R32RD311POLW7G,i will be adding hinges to the front storage compartment.i wish there was an option to have it assembled already or much clearer instructions.
R3UV1JFURN9YV8,love it!

R3Q7WX4M498CIA,the metal piece that holds the blade on the top of the copter broke.

R1LIPS5FWOET2I,wont fly at all.
R1LIPS5FWOET2I,save your money for something better like a syma.
R1LIPS5FWOET2I,"just because its ""the worlds smallest"" is no reason to spend your money on this inferior toy."
RWIC1TSBS7AT1,when i got the evil minion the box was torn up
R11LBZVXQ1N4IF,cute but a little pricey for the product
R3TA9US5LMMG11,these toys are ok but cheaply made and the pups cant fit in the vehicles which makes them a little pointless.
R3TA9US5LMMG11,my kid was constantly asking why skys helicopter wasnt there and same w ryders atv.
R3TA9US5LMMG11,i eventually coughed up the money to buy the real version where the pups can ride there vehicles but for the price this version is not too bad
R2M2G131DFEG9L,most were only us stamps but in good condition.
R1UZUVFCZPFH6W,"gift for grandson, he loves to sit in tents and play."
R39D5ZMPQ7VZIG,i was disappointed.

R1M4MTBQZKX2R,lightning has been super wellloved and is still going strong!
R1M4MTBQZKX2R,hes just the right size to hug and carry around.
RDSUX3Z2A68Z8,"i was so excited to get it, but it then didnt fit me at all and i can fit into things like this normally."
RDSUX3Z2A68Z8,its still definitely cute but its unfortunate that i cant wear it myself.
RDSUX3Z2A68Z8,"im pretty thin for 170 lb, its just my hips that cant get into the dress, or my arms."
RDSUX3Z2A68Z8,i couldnt even get the top on the arm holes are small.
RDSUX3Z2A68Z8,ill just be giving it to my friend who i know can fit it.
RDSUX3Z2A68Z8,im disappointed this cosplay doesnt come in other sizes then just one size.
R321EWFDUUKDBR,gave as gift
RILNXGHWLHDRK,hanging in my dorm room!
R18NZXEG34MWZF,"fun,"

R1LQ0KY8UVXAI4,we had soo much fun!
RYWKTZ88BYF5R,"my son is pretty tall for a soon to be 22 month old, but his feet doesnt quite reach the pedals yet."
RYWKTZ88BYF5R,"i am hoping when he is 2 and a half, he will be ready to use this harleydavidson and drive it to good use."
RYWKTZ88BYF5R,"right now, he loves sitting on it and opening and closing the seat."
RYWKTZ88BYF5R,"and, putting anything he can fit into the hidden seat compartment."
RCALWF39RFYZW,great quality.
RCALWF39RFYZW,fast device.
RCALWF39RFYZW,highly recommend this seller
R2TQF6HOXXJOTB,"excellent product, purchased for my grandchild, she loves it too."
R2YLNAEVAWW5I9,best game i have played in years!
R2YLNAEVAWW5I9,if you have a great sense of humor definitely get this game.
R3RGXZL0OBOOWK,the kids love the molds with the hinges.
R3RGXZL0OBOOWK,"the flat molds are not as much fun, but they are still super cute."
R3RGXZL0OBOOWK,"we have trouble keeping the various playdoh colors separate, so there were a lot of tears when we had to throw some of it away, but that is not the fault of the product."
R3RGXZL0OBOOWK,my kids just do better when they play with one color at a time.
R2VMVABMMWXTSW,great little quad for the price.
R2VMVABMMWXTSW,dont let it get away from you though.. we almost lost ours when it went awol 3 blocks over.
R2VMVABMMWXTSW,thank god for those lights!
RVJ7DXZSM67D7,"i bought this book bag for the first day of school for my daughter, book bag came on time, and she loved it."
RVJ7DXZSM67D7,the only thing is i wish the thermos wasnt plastic because she made a mistake and dropped her lunch bag and the thermos bust inside the lunch bag.
R1WTPP8M07IYMI,"great product, purchased for my grandchild, she loves it."
R1HZRTGIUVO3CS,good

R1SHWGHBQ5POXR,i like so must this product.
R1SHWGHBQ5POXR,thank you
R3LHPN4KG3NSFZ,"my chiropractor has me using one of these for neck stretches, but my toddler always wants to play with it so went to amazon to get him his own."
R3LHPN4KG3NSFZ,the first thing i learned is that the beach balls are measured based on the length of half the circumference rather than the diameter.
R3LHPN4KG3NSFZ,"once i figured out that i needed the 12&34 size which are smaller than a typical beach ball, i saw that a lot of buyers of similar products complained that they either did not match the photos or were hard to inflate since the oneway valves either did not work or were absent so air leaks out before you can close it.this particular brand is more expensive than some, but description indicated that they were higher quality than the others."
R3LHPN4KG3NSFZ,i ended up getting a discount on these so the price was very good.
R3LHPN4KG3NSFZ,so far there have been no damaged ones and they do look like the photos which is exactly what i wanted.
R3LHPN4KG3NSFZ,"the oneway valves are not perfect, but they work better than the existing one that i have so i can keep most of the air in them when closing the valve."
R3LHPN4KG3NSFZ,"also they dont seem perfectly round, but i would not even have thought about this if it had not been mentioned in the description, so that does not bother me anyway.my toddler was very excited to be able to take this to the beach, and his friend wanted one also."
R3LHPN4KG3NSFZ,"even though there are 12 in the pack, they are come in a very small package."
R3LHPN4KG3NSFZ,"although its not necessary, i was able to use the intex bellows foot pump  to inflate these."
R2ABFL73VIUVV0,everything good so far
R2FD2DZ5746MG9,"fun,fun fun!!"
R2FD2DZ5746MG9,nice loves it

R2DQDW6P0PB8NN,he has spent hours and hours building different marble mazes.
R1Z4TOBDAYARD5,granddaughter love it.
R1Z4TOBDAYARD5,had a lot of fun playing with it.
R1K7PZP50PWK9A,great quality.
R1K7PZP50PWK9A,my 18 month old loves these!
R1MA3T24E3LJ1Q,i chose this bikerideon for my daughter who has balance issues.
R1MA3T24E3LJ1Q,"the balance bikes were too frustrating yet for her height, the usual rideons were too low to the ground."
R1MA3T24E3LJ1Q,the bike arrived put together big plus and she was riding it 2 min later.
R1MA3T24E3LJ1Q,she loves it.
R1MA3T24E3LJ1Q,"its stable, its cute, its unique."
R1MA3T24E3LJ1Q,i would recommend it!
R1MA3T24E3LJ1Q,!
R2R88Q96T492H5,my daughter wanted this so bad because she played it in school.
R2R88Q96T492H5,"once she got it, she never played with it."
R2R88Q96T492H5,"good idea, i suppose."
R2R88Q96T492H5,but must just be more fun at school.
R2O3BLG92WBLQ0,we received this as a gift two years ago.
R2O3BLG92WBLQ0,as others have said its very hard for the kids to grind on their own.
R2O3BLG92WBLQ0,it also makes a huge mess of tiny little balls of playdough.
R2O3BLG92WBLQ0,"the other chuck themed playdough sets we have are great, this one is just a lot of work for the parents my kids love it, hence why we still have it two years later..."
R27WD9N6L3GU16,"got these as a gift, but they look nice."
R1QC48YNLD7YZT,i used this for a backdrop for the photo booth.
R1QC48YNLD7YZT,it worked out great!
R2CN7HS3CUU6FW,good
R2EZZAH2TTLQ6M,loved it.
R1EC09ZDRQX28T,"this figure is a recolor and retool of the previous ""robots in disguise"" grimlock warrior class figure."
R1EC09ZDRQX28T,it features a new head and a color scheme based on the original grimlock from the 80s.
R1EC09ZDRQX28T,i much prefer this version over the previous one.
R1EC09ZDRQX28T,the gold color in particular looks fantastic.
R1EC09ZDRQX28T,unfortunately the figure does not come with any weapons.
R1EC09ZDRQX28T,i wouldve liked a sword or something.
R1EC09ZDRQX28T,"mine had no issues with its joints, but youll definitely want to check yours out carefully once you get it."
R1EC09ZDRQX28T,"for a detailed review, check out my site at"
R1F70H2AO6ARO0,thanks
R12ETMNSFFQ1UP,awesome!
RJR7RSGW3TITE,perfect!
R2HSTYB688M08L,finely crafted with a lot of detail and great paint job.
R2HSTYB688M08L,looks like the movie antman and also has antony or some generic ant about 2.5&34 long.
R2HSTYB688M08L,the two micro figures are static little models and have little detail they are super tiny about an inch tall but are very amusing if you have seen the movie.
R2HSTYB688M08L,so it is kind of fun to have them sitting on your tv or something fighting one another need sticky tape to make them stand.oh and ultrons head which is crucial to have the pretty sweet ultron figure.
RNWX3BSMAKI3C,wonderful to do
R32IQZNDHF8GSK,adorable!
R32IQZNDHF8GSK,well made and the price is right.
R32IQZNDHF8GSK,our daughter loves to play with it.
R32IQZNDHF8GSK,smart purchase for the money.
R1Q1ARN7QGTK67,i cant seem to pair this to the actual x4 device using the control.
R1Q1ARN7QGTK67,it did flew for 4 seconds and then no more.
R1Q1ARN7QGTK67,"i have read the manual up and down, and the remote does turn on but the actual light on the center of it indicating it is paired with the x4, only came once and no longer so it is impossible for me to get it to calibrate, much less get this device to fly."
R1Q1ARN7QGTK67,"it could be the batteries, i will buy some tomorrow but i doubt it since the battery bar is giving 3 bars of strength."
R2XPV66HU16IHU,no issues.
R2XPV66HU16IHU,arrived quickly.
R2PP6NOR5I8IKG,exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
RXWN0MXVK4JD9,damaged.
RKFXXHCZMV1GD,the gloves were way to big for a 4 year old.
RKFXXHCZMV1GD,took a chance that they might work or i could modify them but decided he didnt really need them after all.
R3VOGGX15QUON2,"the shipping box was in good shape but the box the kit was in was somewhat crushed, luckily no parts were damaged."
R3VOGGX15QUON2,this must have occurred before it was placed in the shipping container.
R3VOGGX15QUON2,"the kit was a mixture of die cut parts and laser cut parts, the laser cut parts were excellent to work with but the a dull die must have been used because those parts were difficult to remove."
R3VOGGX15QUON2,"if laser cut parts are available for a given kit then that is what you should get, not a mixture."
R3VOGGX15QUON2,i also would recommend supplying a four bladed prop for a nonflying build.
R3VOGGX15QUON2,not as happy with this kit as with other guillows kits.
R1WPOCT4FXUZ9L,"if i could give this order no stars, i would."
R1WPOCT4FXUZ9L,"instead of receiving wooden melissa and doug fruit and vegetables like i thought i ordered, i received cheap styrofoam garbage from china."
R1WPOCT4FXUZ9L,they reaked of chemicals and are nothing like the real melissa and doug products.
RUVHBP071QC26,"yes it glows in the dark ,but dont lay it down anywhere you do want something to stick to it."
RUVHBP071QC26,always ...always put it back in the container .
RUVHBP071QC26,its like it gets runny not solid over night all over the place.
RUVHBP071QC26,i had silly putty growing up and it did not melt over night.
RUVHBP071QC26,you can reshape it in the morning but just dont leave it just laying away wear.
RUVHBP071QC26,put it back in the metal can.
R25TOUFFW66C7R,"very cute, but the figure didnt come with the advertised features."
R25TOUFFW66C7R,"she is lacking the hair accessory, which is a big part of why i love her design."
R1POWFM775YSQY,"my three year old grandson is all about insects, spiders, and ocean life... so of course we had to get the ant."
R1POWFM775YSQY,what is really neat about this is the label has facts about the ant that he loved to hear about.
R1POWFM775YSQY,that made it a win win purchase.
R1W23JH3BFXDJE,love it
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,very well made.
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,"a lot of detail, great paint job, looks a bit like henry cavill, the cape is nicely molded to look like a fluttering cape you can see it in the pic."
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,end result is a figure that is bound to make you happy.
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,why 4stars?
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,articulation is good enough but inferior to the marvel legends infinite line.
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,lacks some of the extra joints like no torso forward bending.
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,some of the plastic joints also lack some finesse in such a way that more stylized poses look weird.
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,like the hip joint is most notably soso.
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,id say dont skip the figure just cause of this joint comment.
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,it is still worth having just adjust your expectations.important notecomes with an &34s&34 shield that you can use as a stand for the figure.
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,dont almost throw it out like i did.
R1T41JJ0DMSAXK,it is in the box if you look for it enough.
RABY4MBV59A9A,worth the money.
RABY4MBV59A9A,been using it for 2 months and still runs like its brand new.
RABY4MBV59A9A,definitely buying another one for christmas.
R2CG4W07SE06X4,excellent.
R2CG4W07SE06X4,would do business again.
R2CG4W07SE06X4,thanks for the great product.
R21XRCNC4OY7M1,"received two 680s, two were 600s."
R21XRCNC4OY7M1,bad quality.
R21XRCNC4OY7M1,if you are looking for four 680s  stay away.
R21XRCNC4OY7M1,i dont understand how amazon alows this bundle to be sold this way.
R21XRCNC4OY7M1,"the charger is plain awful, battery connectors do not fit correctly either."
R21XRCNC4OY7M1,return initiated 5 minutes after receiving.
RBD7WXP6097DD,i bought these to use in my classroom.
RBD7WXP6097DD,"they were really adorable, the kids used them to decorate thank you cards to volunteers and mentors who were special to us during the first part of the year."
RBD7WXP6097DD,they loved them.

RFDASLDAJIILJ,wonderful product!
RFDASLDAJIILJ,fast shipping.
R2W51BF89WIABY,"charger works great, but gets extremely hot when used to charge more than 4 batteries at one time."
R2W51BF89WIABY,i avoid charging that many at once because the heat from the box makes me quite nervous.
R2W51BF89WIABY,"it does charge six at once, though."
R2W51BF89WIABY,"i dont know if the extreme heat is dangerous, but it cant be the best thing for it."
R18LL34KPC36PO,"one of the gorgeous spectra vondergeist dolls, next in line to my favorites of her are drop dot spectra and high school rock or picture day spectra, thanks!"
R2EUDBMTRO3J5I,very nice

RS7Z76QVMRALI,grandchildren love these
R1H66XFZ301P5Q,"this is a nice selection of stickers, 10 packs for a total of 70 stickers in all."
R1H66XFZ301P5Q,my son got very excited when he opened the first back and got tom brady.
R1H66XFZ301P5Q,he has spent hours reading over the stats of all the players in this collection.
R1H66XFZ301P5Q,this is the perfect set to compliment the matching sticker album also available.
R1H66XFZ301P5Q,these are good quality stickers and lots of fun for any major football fan.i received these stickers for free to review.
R1H66XFZ301P5Q,all opinion are 100 my own.
R3TH90FB6F4W9A,love it
R2G0KLIYQI8PFQ,"my kids ages 8, 5 and 3 absolutely love this game."
R2G0KLIYQI8PFQ,"the 3yo needs some suggestions for ""good moves"" but it definitely is a family classic."
R2G0KLIYQI8PFQ,it is challenging enough for adults but easy enough for children.
R2G0KLIYQI8PFQ,it is part luck and part skill and planning.
R2OTX8IDI4J25M,beautiful dress
R2N8Z5A96E3HJ,one of my grandsons favorite bath toys.
R2N8Z5A96E3HJ,a great investment.
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,this is a great intro to a classic game for younger kids.
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,my 4 year old is crazy about junior monopoly.
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,we play it at least twice a day.
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,its been great for teaching basic addition and subtraction and word recognition on the chance cards.
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,i took a star off for general cheapness.
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,no tray to organize the money and chips.
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,"also no houses, just little cardboard chips with your game piece on it."
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,i think he really would have enjoyed the little houses to put on his property.
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,also the board is folded into four pieces which my toddler tore apart way to easily which lead to some serious tears from my four year old.
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,i wish the board was bifold!
R1PN7AR8C97PM9,we taped it back together though and its been fine.
R1JLAQJXYS06JY,my 12 month old daughter loves pushing this around.
R1JLAQJXYS06JY,it is very well made with a nice design.
R1JLAQJXYS06JY,very happy with this toy.
R2REANL17V5PU,"they diapers are too small for a life sized baby doll, but my niece still loved it."
R1OVH1RN492HOE,it was awful pulled apart first day by younger!!
R1OVH1RN492HOE,!
ROY9844CLBY3G,"this is a great item, it was a gift for my granddaughter a granddaug and she loved it."
R229EBH8M2NUPY,"for this price, you really cant make a better product."
R229EBH8M2NUPY,does fall apart after about 20 uses though.
R229EBH8M2NUPY,easy to fix unless something snaps.
RRTPZ78J2RS5P,my daughter loves it
R2PFC8FGLD7L6C,toy is slow but good for my grandson who just turned four.
R2PFC8FGLD7L6C,lots of parts to put together.
R1J6OML2SQ1IMT,great great strings.
R1J6OML2SQ1IMT,will buy again
R3ULQOXBWBHAB7,we ordered the mickey mouse version and received the frozen couch.
R3ULQOXBWBHAB7,"return approval was immediate, return process was inconvenient due to size."
R3ULQOXBWBHAB7,product itself was good.
RFEX76093NK2G,i was disappointed with the racks.
RFEX76093NK2G,"they were stated as wood but they are particle board and very heavy,"
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,"this fun park comes with a pet ferret, jebbie cho, and is a fun toy set for any little pet shop fan."
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,"the box says for kids over 6, but i think this suits kids as young as 4 so long as its assembled by someone else, and the child is gentle with toys as this toy isnt really sturdy when assembled."
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,lots of fun items are included so that jebbie can have a blast.
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,"theres a zip line, a yellow turning wheel and a blue tunnel."
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,but the most fun feature is that the cheese car and animal car snap onto the flagpole and jebbie can sit in a car and go for a spin.
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,"weeee!even if a child cant assemble the fun park, little kids can help decorate with the included stickers."
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,"sets can be combined to create a whole lps world, so its a fun toy for kids when playing with friends who also have lps toys."
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,its a cute set for imaginative play that can occupy a child for at least an hour or two at a time.
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,"lps sets make great gifts as lots of kids love them ive bought quite a few sets as gifts, they can take them right out of the box for immediate play and they fall into a reasonable price range."
R1O9A8ORVBK6ME,made in china.
R1CB3BZXF9YUGW,"this was a gift for my 3 year old son, who has speech apraxia."
R1CB3BZXF9YUGW,"he makes every effort to play with it, follow the ""buh"" around, and it has held up well."
R1CB3BZXF9YUGW,"it rocks, rolls, and senses when its stuck and navigates its way around to keep moving."
R1CB3BZXF9YUGW,"great gift, and even his little brother 1 enjoys it!"
R1CB3BZXF9YUGW,winwin!
R3668VY57IRSX8,my daughter loves to walk this around all day!
R2FW97WFAMQZPN,what you see is exactly what you get.
R2FW97WFAMQZPN,made for a great time at my summer party.
R3DGECT3RFDD07,this is a fun toy for young builders.
R3DGECT3RFDD07,instead of just a bunch of parts it has clear instructions in a sort of storybook that talks about each vehicle youll build.
R3DGECT3RFDD07,my son and i 4.5 year old built quite a few of them together and he could follow most of the instruction with some coaching.
R3DGECT3RFDD07,"this is more ikealike put together rather than engineering but building from instructions is a great start anyway.once together the vehicles arent exactly solid, theyll come apart and can be fixed by your kid which is fun as well."
R3DGECT3RFDD07,i dont really consider that an issue.
R3DGECT3RFDD07,"nor do i have a problem with parts getting lost, then you get to design and build your own with parts on hand."
R3DGECT3RFDD07,my star removal and the real problem with this toy comes from the durability of the axles.
R3DGECT3RFDD07,"hey, its an engineering toy, what is subject to the strongest and most varied forces on a kids toy vehicle?"
R3DGECT3RFDD07,"yeah, so why make the axles from super thin, soft and hollow plastic??"
R3DGECT3RFDD07,would it really have been that much more expensive to make them solid or hard plastic?
R3DGECT3RFDD07,were only a week into having this toy and most of the axles are deformed in some way.
R3DGECT3RFDD07,luckily since theyre soft thing plastic you can push them through some of the holes in the other parts and get them into a mostly functional shape.
R3DGECT3RFDD07,"that should keep them going for a while, but this isnt going to be a toy youll be playing with for years or passing down to multiple kids.all in all its worth the fun and building up those problem solving skills, just know what youre getting going in."
RZKSAPJNOIB5V,i definitely dont suggest this heli for anyone who is not at least a 6ch intermediate pilot.
RZKSAPJNOIB5V,"if you are not experienced in flying 6ch birds, you will have a very difficult time flying this one."
RZKSAPJNOIB5V,"i am an expert 3ch, an intermediate 4ch, but a novice 6ch pilot and i havent even been able to get this bird to hover yet, much less fly or do any stunts!!"
RZKSAPJNOIB5V,it has a very powerful motor for its size and is extremely loud.
RZKSAPJNOIB5V,"do not waste your money on this unless you are a very experienced pilot, especially with 6ch birds!!!!"
RZKSAPJNOIB5V,"after crashing it multiple times, i decided to pack it away until i get more experience with other 6ch birds."
RZKSAPJNOIB5V,"i will try it again later, but i am disappointed."
R2S3AMDMALDRAA,love hagrid!
R2S3AMDMALDRAA,this is a really cute figure of him.
R2S3AMDMALDRAA,sturdy and substantial just like hagrid himself!
R1N4Q07EVV4DR9,"i had this game for 8 days total, played about 15 games and the pictures have worn off the dice."
R1N4Q07EVV4DR9,"we played on a wooden dinner table, so it was not a rough service."
R1N4Q07EVV4DR9,"i was very excited about the the nightmare before christmas theme, but we only were able to get a few games out of it."
R30E2M18IS9LNN,this car was perfect .
R3OYJJFYN2ZADF,these leave stains on the tub and all the color runs off the crayon when left in shower.
R3OYJJFYN2ZADF,the munchkin crayons are the best.
R3OYJJFYN2ZADF,not these.
R12PVOPEUJSK6G,"almost a must for wizards, so useful."
R12PVOPEUJSK6G,"cards are lightly laminated, standard size, and contain all the information for casting requirements."
R12PVOPEUJSK6G,"some spell descriptions cant fit on the card, but page numbers in the phb tell you where to find the longer description."
R12PVOPEUJSK6G,"every spell in the 5th edition players handbook is present, and expansion packs for the new spells come out when applicable ex temple of elemental evil.how we use add known spells to the players pile of cards."
R12PVOPEUJSK6G,place ready spells into rows according to level.
R12PVOPEUJSK6G,place a glass bead representing unused spell slots near each row for its level we use different colored beads for each level as well.
R12PVOPEUJSK6G,"remove a glass bead when that spell level of spell is cast.certainly not required, but if you can afford the little niceties, its totally worth the money to stop digging the phb constantly.of note."
R12PVOPEUJSK6G,"the box can be a bit flimsy, might want to get something stronger to store it in."
R363GSASO6ONQB,great toy
R2ERDWCHQ37AZP,i bought this for my grandsons fourth birthday!
R2ERDWCHQ37AZP,"he was so excited when he opened the package and saw it was ""zoomer""!"
R2ERDWCHQ37AZP,!
RO2PZNWMLN7YA,awesome rocket kit...this thing is huge!
RLPQUGC7IXEHI,great game
R1TDAAJQMF0KKH,as expected!
R1041VFSKMUHPB,"all the little tikes i have owned have held up very well, and were like new by the time my children outgrew them."
R1041VFSKMUHPB,this item does not live up to the little tikes reputation.
R1041VFSKMUHPB,i bought this for my granddaughters second birthday in june 2015. the first one we put together had problems with one of the doors closing properly.
R1041VFSKMUHPB,i asked for a new one which was promptly shipped and received.
R1041VFSKMUHPB,i had the problem with the second one too so figured this is just the way they were made.
R1041VFSKMUHPB,now one of the rubber circles that go around the wheel keeps coming off.
R1041VFSKMUHPB,"this car is kept at our house, her grandparents, and she only uses it when she comes over."
R1041VFSKMUHPB,it has not been abused.
R1041VFSKMUHPB,i would not purchase this product again if given the choice.

R2OO3OTPZH9OXL,my one year old niece loved this!

R6GN1QJA6GQK7,very meh.
R2VKQHMC5X9I2M,great!
R35UMH9GA1O84,"the game is sneaky, snacky squirrel."
R35UMH9GA1O84,its one of the kids favorite games.
R35UMH9GA1O84,it is an educational game that helps with memorizing colors and building motor skills.
R35UMH9GA1O84,2 4 people can play ages 3 and up.
R35UMH9GA1O84,its easy enough they can play by themselves.
R35UMH9GA1O84,the only thing with this game.
R35UMH9GA1O84,if your child can out grow it quickly.very similar to the classic hi hi cherryo.
R35UMH9GA1O84,"you spin to either collect, lose or steal and nut."
R35UMH9GA1O84,"first person to collect 1 of everyone color nut wins.however, the components for this game are amazing!"
R35UMH9GA1O84,the squirrel &34tweezers&34 are made a a heavy duty plastic and is simply adorable.
R35UMH9GA1O84,when using this squirrel it help develop fine motor skills.
R35UMH9GA1O84,"the nut are also plastic and bring very durable.ages 38players 24playing time1020 minutesmaterials this game is very well made.replay value 4 stars, almost all of our friends will play it more than once at one time.recommend it to others yes, if you have kids who are young enough for it."
R35UMH9GA1O84,i would not buy this new for a kid under age 7.
R2X9IOC901BCDA,"if you want a ton of dice, well, bam there you go."
R2X9IOC901BCDA,all of the dice are the same quality as the regular chessex dice.
R2X9IOC901BCDA,"the full sets almost always a boring white with different colored numbers, but, dang, if you want a lot of dice..."
R3QTFNTS65QN3M,great
R3J5555Y3ZMDGV,"my preschooler cant throw a normal frisbee, theyre too heavy and bulky."
R3J5555Y3ZMDGV,this one was so easy to throw he was having a blast and gaining confidence in his abilities.
R2ZWPQSVY6ZOA5,great
R2G1W6AMLYA71C,very nice
R2ADVNC2YUC6X2,arrived on time and doing its job
R1NSSA7RU8SDPY,easy to assemble and well made toy.
R1NSSA7RU8SDPY,my 2.5 yo and 5.5 yo enjoyed playing this toy together.
R1NSSA7RU8SDPY,my older child helped align the cars for my son as it was a little difficult for him.
R1NSSA7RU8SDPY,"after multiple car crashes into walls and furniture, the cars still held up well."
R1TX3UJPYLJ15B,bought two of these for adult and kids lunches.
R1TX3UJPYLJ15B,i love these.
R1TX3UJPYLJ15B,"nice and durable, great quality."
R1TX3UJPYLJ15B,cute but not too cutesy for an older boy and adults
R13ZEWDPD01R2V,"these figurines are from china and when received, gave off a terrible odor."
R13ZEWDPD01R2V,i boiled them and it was a little better.

R385MV9HM0Z29D,my daughter loves this
R1VXO073B9HOGC,"you have to prep every single little piece, and i sure wish they would make the window glass out of a different material, this stuff is so easy to screw up!!"
R1VXO073B9HOGC,but the little house is cute now its done and my daughter loves it so all good...  i added the base and the picket fence.
RU98WDSITMA3A,gave as a gift  child loved it!
R1ZT8J6W38X30Q,meh.
R1ZT8J6W38X30Q,"its pretty cute but ""cheap""."
R1ZT8J6W38X30Q,i probably would have sent back if i paid a penny more than the $18something.
R1ZT8J6W38X30Q,im sure it will be fine the few times we will use it for overnights at family members homes.
R34BQA2TWV3RPB,a fantastic bundle for your inexpensive rc vehicles
R1P8889YDCTLW6,good performance with all clips and darts minus whistler and mega darts.
R1P8889YDCTLW6,"i personally modified mine by doubling the voltage up to 12v, there are two ways to do this, you can either rewire it internally required to remove the locks, although locks are not intrusive on this blaster and put in a dc plug at the base of the pistol grip wired in series with the internal battery compartment, and use a handheld battery bank, or you could ""ghetto mod"" it by simply attaching battery bank wires to the appropriate terminals at the rear of the compartment spring is negative, black wire, and plate is positive, red wire with the internal modification you will have to have some electronics knowhow, if you can solder then you can probably do this, however a ""ghetto mod"" only requires basic ""put a wire on this"" skills."
R1P8889YDCTLW6,"in both cases, it helps to have a hot melt glue gun, to secure wires or battery banks, or you could not modify it at all, in which case out of the box performance is adequate, and backwards compatibility is excellent."
R1NYXHQR8GY1VI,these are the greatest for holding the numeral dominoes for mexican train.
R1NYXHQR8GY1VI,we have 2 sets but this was a wedding gift.
RFK0KJNIBYVK,at its core its what you expectmonopoly.
RFK0KJNIBYVK,"it has the classic game play at its heart, and if you like monopoly but are looking for a change of pace, this is for you."
RFK0KJNIBYVK,"if you dont like monopoly, there are some game play changes unlike some of the novelty sets, but its still basically monopoly.the changes include the cosmetic ones renamed spaces and restyles but well made pieces, as well as the passport idea."
RFK0KJNIBYVK,"all in all its less cutthroat and more fun, but not that much more interesting than monopoly."
RFK0KJNIBYVK,"itll get played again, but who knows when."
R1WQWNPZW13YTL,buy it.
R1WQWNPZW13YTL,put beer it cup holder.
R1WQWNPZW13YTL,kick back and float while your legs dangle in the water .. not flopping over the top of and uncomfortable tube.
RAV02R8003YOD,"great,thanks !"
RAV02R8003YOD,!
R2IH8HDKID6DJQ,hours of fun and imagination for my grandkids.
R2IH8HDKID6DJQ,nice coloring.
R1RDHA5D2QDD3L,i cant same much beyond my love for this very high quality deadpool funko fabrikation.
R1RDHA5D2QDD3L,it sits proudly on my shelf.
R1RDHA5D2QDD3L,"i just wish his belt had the little deadpool symbol on it, but otherwise its great for any fan!"
RGYDPJISKKDMY,i purchased two of these rafts and love them!!!
RGYDPJISKKDMY,we have taken them out to the lake 3 times this summer and they have been perfect every time.
RGYDPJISKKDMY,our friends have one that is conjoined and that thing is pretty boss too.
RGYDPJISKKDMY,i highly recommend the river run rafts!
RGYDPJISKKDMY,"one note... they keep you pretty high up off the water... so if you want to kick your feet to maneuver on the lake, it can be a little difficult."
RGYDPJISKKDMY,"this doesnt really bother me, but my husband thinks its worth noting."
RGYDPJISKKDMY,"also, our air mattress pump blows these up in no time."
R1WHE9W5YBZUIQ,"shipped fast, was exactly the game my son had played in school."
R1WHE9W5YBZUIQ,lots of fun
R39C7JUYSJKN89,fun stuff
R31IUKM68VM2VA,second super wings and i cant get over the quality and detail.
R31IUKM68VM2VA,my son just recently became interested in super wings and we couldnt find the toys anywhere except amazon.
R31IUKM68VM2VA,"upon review, my first thought was this has to be an overpriced, cheap, short lasting product however, when this one and our other arrived i couldnt get over the quality and detail of this transforming toy."
R31IUKM68VM2VA,it is certainly not a frail toy.
R10I3WV5CJZ44R,very sturdy item that brought back great nostalgic memories.
R10I3WV5CJZ44R,it was delivered in a very timely manner and the descriptions were all very accurate.
RKM6R6M0CFU3Q,excellent batteries for the price
R35HKOMZ9O8DHC,amazing as cake toppers
R2OB4MFKF80HGV,love it
R1UCZQI81D3U9F,the dress was pretty but it immediately started shedding blue glitter everywhere  big and little pieces from the fabric.
R1UCZQI81D3U9F,our 3.5 yr old daughter wears a 45 in regular clothes and doesnt like things tight.
R1UCZQI81D3U9F,this was form fitting around her torso with stretchy fabric.
R1UCZQI81D3U9F,she didnt like it that fitted.
R1UCZQI81D3U9F,"so, this is going back."
R1UCZQI81D3U9F,it was a great price and pretty but truly the glitter would have been a huge headache for us.
R1UCZQI81D3U9F,we repacked and vacuumed.
R18B40TKWO7W5,"looks very good, arguably the best of the bh grimwing molds."
R18B40TKWO7W5,"however, this toy suffers the same drawback as the other molds in that the robot chest parts dont lock into place without some sort of modding done."
R18B40TKWO7W5,"as a display piece, its awesome as is but as an action figure, its lackluster until you fix the chest problem."
R1SF08ZJMI7B4P,very small.
R1SF08ZJMI7B4P,i expected it to be much larger.
R1X5I2PPVBVYU0,these are the best mowers ive seen.
R1X5I2PPVBVYU0,the sound is incredibly realistic but completely mechanical!
R1X5I2PPVBVYU0,"we dont actually use the bubble part  our kids havent figured out, yet, that it is a possibility  and our boys love to run them around the house in circles."
R1X5I2PPVBVYU0,we bought one for our twins when they were about two and soon had to buy a second when it became the most popular toy in the house.
R1X5I2PPVBVYU0,we bought one for our friends 1 year olds birthday and he immediately started pushing it around and loves it.
R3GZYEKXBBH5GI,thought the animal net was going to be bigger was to small
R2CDLOJSPMXG7E,my son said it loves it.
R373MA6ZGT0AVL,these sunglasses are cheap... but theyre pretty good.
R373MA6ZGT0AVL,it has a nice fit and it compliments my face shape.
R373MA6ZGT0AVL,i like it alright.
R3AMKF1CUHD697,very cute!
R4QD1ANI2KA3I,detailed & high quality!
R4QD1ANI2KA3I,"hes honestly adorable, how could you not buy this?"
R4QD1ANI2KA3I,"no complaints, here."
R4QD1ANI2KA3I,easy to assemble & he does come with a stand.
R4QD1ANI2KA3I,banpresto hardly disappoints!
R1O4I8M95PEU08,my grand daughter loves this!
RWU1WUJAHEJJ2,were great fans of schleich products  they are heirloom toys quality meant to last several kids rather than the play and destroy cheap toys so prevalent today.
RWU1WUJAHEJJ2,"as well as hand details and care, expect a very nice product that you can that displays beautifully when not in use."
RWU1WUJAHEJJ2,"so yes, very much worth the higher cost.with the playmat, we get the basis for a complete horse farm  from arena to stable."
RWU1WUJAHEJJ2,the mat is made in the eu germany as are all schleich products  so expect high standards for safety and quality.
RWU1WUJAHEJJ2,"although you might feel like this is a lure to invest in a complete set of schleich horse products so you can fill in the sections, in truth you really dont need every piece."
RWU1WUJAHEJJ2,the playmat has a clean design that doesnt necessarily need all the buildings in order to be useful.
RWU1WUJAHEJJ2,"but for horse loving kids, this really does set the stage for imaginative play.the rug has a non skid backing and is made from easy care nylon."
RWU1WUJAHEJJ2,the edges have a quality finish that wont unravel.
RWU1WUJAHEJJ2,ours laid flat easily once unrolled and our girls were ready to play.we greatly enjoy our schleich horses and sets and i enjoy having a toy that can be passed down to each child and then saved for grandchildren one day.
R4YYNMWWAUIBC,great all in musical toy with lots of options for kids to learn different sounds as well as skills.our 3 year old grandson plays with it everyday.
R1TQ4N1BDRAHFD,these are not ping pong balls that you could play on an official ping pong table.
R1TQ4N1BDRAHFD,bits of plastic around the the center circumference cause ball to bounce erratically.
R1TQ4N1BDRAHFD,this item should be listed as a childrens toy when advertised.
R2AVA602WRJMJY,great toy!
R2AVA602WRJMJY,i bought this for my daughter and the size is big enough for her to really play with it and not have to crouch around little crevices or anything like that.
R1VLZQCWRLD8KS,its a great mug!the confused look on deadpools face is perfect.
R1VLZQCWRLD8KS,i swear you can hear him mumble incoherently as you sip coffee out of his head.the mug is well crafted.
R1VLZQCWRLD8KS,the glaze is even and the paint is neatly applied.
R1VLZQCWRLD8KS,it has and oversized handle so you can get a firm grip on the mug by the bak of the head or the handle.
R1VLZQCWRLD8KS,"it arrived in its original marvel packaging which it can be displayed in, if youd prefer a collectible to look at it instead of use."
R3JSYIW6GKOW9D,5 year old granddaughter loves them.
R3JSYIW6GKOW9D,they will go great with her barn im building for them.
RXUCZEXT30IBM,"just because you buy a case for one card game does not mean you have to use it for that game... i love this case  we use it for every card set we have  i dont have the game mentioned but lots of cards for other games and this hold all of them and keeps them safe for all my travels to the kids for game night very nice made case, it is sturdy and well made and very perfect for the traveling game night.. i was very lucky to have received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
RXUCZEXT30IBM,i love it and am very happy to provide my opinion after getting it and testing it out.
R16DR7FG541C8X,super fun until i got it stuck in a tree but thats not its fault.
RT1SCOWCMJ1H0,i bought these as a stand alone set for my 14 month old to keep her busy as i cook in the kitchen.
RT1SCOWCMJ1H0,she enjoys these.
RT1SCOWCMJ1H0,they are made of better material so dont smell like plastic.
RT1SCOWCMJ1H0,my 4.5 year old son also plays along with her with these so now they both keep busy.
R1MHIOTXDXA9TZ,we ordered this amazing table for my soon to be 2 year old.
R1MHIOTXDXA9TZ,"he loves disneys cars and he loves the wood trains, so the combination was perfect for him."
R1MHIOTXDXA9TZ,i was worried when i saw the other reviews that it would be a mission to build.
R1MHIOTXDXA9TZ,"let me tell you, we had it done in under an hour with 2 adults building it."
R1MHIOTXDXA9TZ,"hubby did the table, but i helped with the track.my son does not stop playing with it!"
R1MHIOTXDXA9TZ,its the perfect height for him to reach around and play with everything.
R1MHIOTXDXA9TZ,"i especially like the track around the edge, gives him a great place to put his extra cars.only thing i am debating is whether i want to wood glue the track down."
R1MHIOTXDXA9TZ,"it is built really well, but my little one likes to pull certain pieces off and then he gets frustrated putting them back.overall i love it !"
R1MHIOTXDXA9TZ,it is worth the money
R2AXMAI3E7G8CK,cute
RF0K6UK4XI34Z,what else do you expect from a box.the are study.

R37KJLB8XHPE4W,i only wish there was a volume button.
R37KJLB8XHPE4W,the songs are catchy

R1B5UZY5RR65CC,"easy assembly, easy to use and gives parents a break!"
R1B5UZY5RR65CC,would be nice if it had 2 or 3 more baseballs but still a great but

R8OURFRS0VYT7,thanks
RH6ROU38P9CW5,recently purchased this robot from targets clearance for under 50 dollars.
RH6ROU38P9CW5,"you can get bored very quickly if you just use it as a remote control toy since due to its analog nature, the robot cant even walk straight."
RH6ROU38P9CW5,"however, the fun value of this robot increases significantly once you learn how to program it."
RH6ROU38P9CW5,the programming is very simple using the included remote.
RH6ROU38P9CW5,"the robot basically has three sensors right touch sensor, left touch sensor and sound sensor and you basically program maximum of 6 steps the robot how to act when each sensor is activated."
RH6ROU38P9CW5,the cool thing is you can link up to 14 programs together so you can have a master program of up to 84 steps 14x6.
RH6ROU38P9CW5,"i highly recommend the book ""the robosapien companion"" by james samans if you want to learn more."
R14YHYC77ZXSYS,so light so amazing so happy with this
R3NDHDD4PWX2PM,pricy for the item regular is half price

R120JRZN2AWJOF,grand daughter loved it!
R3VXCLWU5U9XT8,product does not work!
R3LGFXRIAJC4JX,i am in complete agreement with the other reviews of this product.
R3LGFXRIAJC4JX,the memory balls are nearly impossible to place correctly in the projector and are fuzzy and practically unrecognizable once they finally do settle in to the right spot.
R3LGFXRIAJC4JX,for the price $40 it really should have come with the console so the headquarters scene would be complete.
R3LGFXRIAJC4JX,the projector constantly comes off of its mounting spot.
R3LGFXRIAJC4JX,my son loves inside out but was frustrated with this play set and lost interest after about 15 minutes.
R1A9XG47671ID8,work great and shipped quickly for me.
R31M2CSKUT9YC2,very poor quality material.
R31M2CSKUT9YC2,they are very stiff and uncomfortable.
R31M2CSKUT9YC2,"the price was cheap, so i guess you get what you pay for."
R13MEDWVIJ9JZK,"batteries work great in the syma x5c, though you do have to play with spacing compared to the default one."

R26O61V2U91OKQ,bought this for my 16 year old grandson who is saving for a car.reminded him of old toy trucks tucked some $s inside and he was most pleased withthis gift.

R1JZUGVG3O2MQ8,"its okay, its fun to play with."
R2X9655GM9BC97,"although this dinosaur figure is smaller than some of the others i have reviewed lately, it is every bit as splendid as the bigger ones."
R2X9655GM9BC97,"the colors and the detail work really make this ""baby"" dilophosaurus come alive, and it would play well with some of the other, smaller, dinos in schleichs collection."
R2X9655GM9BC97,"its a fun addition to any collection, just be aware that if you are expecting a larger dino, this one is a smaller scale, but every bit as fun and fascinating!"
R3IA557KZWSI5E,a very nice set.
R3IA557KZWSI5E,the three minions are true to color and design as shown in the picture.this set and all of the other mega bloks minion sets are base on scenes from the movie that was released this past july.
R3IA557KZWSI5E,these minifigs are lego size and can connect on the lego base plates and bricks.
R3IA557KZWSI5E,the vampire minions with coffin will make a nice small halloween display.

R20ADGULZZXLZU,my son loves this!
R20ADGULZZXLZU,"hes used it with the characters it comes with, but its also served as a fun house for his knights or toy animals sometimes even a toy moose or trex needs to stop for breakfast or a nap, you know hes even had his firemen toys pretend to put out fires on the house."
R20ADGULZZXLZU,its very durable and we love that we can take it apart to put away and then put it back together easily whenever he wants it.

RN8VSDZYIF7BM,the machine worked very well right out of the package.
RN8VSDZYIF7BM,"battery life was poor, so after the 3 of batteries we started to use it only a minute or 2 at a time."
RN8VSDZYIF7BM,"make sure you keep the machine clean, the motor itself became ""fouled"" with bubble solution."
RN8VSDZYIF7BM,would not work after about 2 weeks.

R3KU7LQWNTOC8Y,"as someone who understands the importance of getting girls interested in stem, this is a good introduction to basic engineering with learning what a type one lever."
R3KU7LQWNTOC8Y,"but im a bit lost whats beyond the cute illustrations and simple lever.youll need some small nimbly fingers to get the pieces put together, my four year old daughter and husband were excited to see how everything went together and took about five to ten minutes to complete the build."
R3KU7LQWNTOC8Y,"the illustrations in the book are somewhat easy to follow, but we found some steps difficult without the added complete image as reference."
R3KU7LQWNTOC8Y,"the lever itself is neat and moves smoothly, the instruction book does go into small detail about the purpose of the build and a small story that gives background about the benjamin cat and why he wants to be off the ground... however, since building it, my daughter is uninterested in it.it is a good introduction to the goldieblox toys but i dont see myself purchasing this as gifts for friends."
R3KU7LQWNTOC8Y,"the pieces themselves are interchangeable with other goldieblox sets, but with the pieces alone, there arent many options to create other things."
R3KU7LQWNTOC8Y,it is however unique and colorful enough to interest anyone who enjoys building.we were lucky to receive this product free of charge.
R2E8S343W0K9XM,works well
R22LGV0X1B0UJP,"my niece,loved it"
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,i received this product as part of a promotion from the brand via bzzagent.in the package1x blue spinning &34smash bot&341x blue remote control1x grey spinning &34smash bot&341x grey remote control2x lime green weapon attachment2x light blue weapon attachment1x cardboard arena mat1x set of instructionsthe good in my opinion cool & exciting concept remote controlled spinning bots versus each other.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"hard plastic, quality construction."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"made by air hogs, quality brand name."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,genuinely fun to play.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,my kids had a great time with them.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,each bot comes with their own remote.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"each remote and bot are paired together with their own individual channel, there are 3 channels per bot and remote so they radio frequency wont interfere with other bots and remotes."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,my kids loved that you could use the spinning mechanism on the remote control to make the bots spin faster.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"the remote control had two large buttons, which is great for kids."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,screw in  out plates for battery compartments on both bots and remote control for safety.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,my kids were able to play it either on the floor carpet or on a table.the bad batteries...these are battery hogs!
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,they take a combined total of 10 aaa batteries to operate.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,i had to go out and buy additional batteries just to make these work.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"should of came with rechargeable batteries  with this product using 10 aaa batteries in mind, the cost to purchase rechargeable batteries outweighs the thought of purchasing these!"
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"even if you were to get regular batteries, the cost to keep these running would be too expensive.with 3 aaa batteries for each bot and an additional 2 aaa batteries for the remote, i expected them to last longer."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"they did last through 2 hours of ongoing play with my sons though, but you could see the bots spinning less and when they crashed, you could see it struggling to restart spinning."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"the remote control is ok, but could be better designed ergonomically."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,it fits in my hands but my kids had a little trouble holding it for more than 10 minutes.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"the bots do no move forwards or backwards, they only spin."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,this made it really difficult when you had two bots separated and you wanted them to &34clash&34 into each other.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"if you set them close enough to &34clash&34, some times they would not have enough spinning force and they would simply get stuck together because both bots are spinning in separate directions."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,maybe a forward or backward function in version 2?
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"bots were not customizable except with the included weapons.maybe adding additional stickers could help out in the &34customizing&34 department, my kids would of loved that.overallmy kids genually loved these from the first day we received it and opened it."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,i had to run to the store for more batteries but after installation the bots were up and running.my two boys had a lot of fun trying to knock the other bot over.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"i didnt even know about the &34turbo&34 spinning button on the remote, my son figured it out on his own after an hour of playing with it.in my opinion, this is truly a fun toy for my kids."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,they were laughing and enjoying the whole time they were playing it.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"even when we took it over to their friends houses or if other kids were coming over, everybody enjoyed them.unfortunately, the matter that it takes 10 aaa batteries to operate for just a couple of hours just takes away from the &34parenting&34 aspect of maintaining this toy.i wished they included some kind of rechargeable battery system, even if they lasted for only 30 minutes of play."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,the &34replay&34 value would of gone way up if they did include rechargeable batteries.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"ive had to repurchase quite a few batteries already and aaa batteries arent so cheap too.besides the battery issue, i would recommend these &34smash bots."
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,they are fun and super challenging at the same time.
R1T4WYZ6QRJ1D0,"the sturdy plastic construction and quality makes it an ideal toy because its going to last for a long time, thus the 3 stars."
R27J6JGVS22LJR,this is a very good product and it is so much fun to take my little grand daughter to the park and fly the kite.
R27J6JGVS22LJR,we had a great time and came home exhausted.
R27J6JGVS22LJR,we are planning to go to the beach next week for more play time.
R27J6JGVS22LJR,"the sunshine, the fresh air and the breeze are so wonderful."
R27J6JGVS22LJR,i will buy another kite from this company soon.
R2FBQZBE6DY1V3,oh my did my 6 year okd little girl just love this!
R2FBQZBE6DY1V3,she was just tickled to death every day to see how much bigger it would get everyday after school.
R2FBQZBE6DY1V3,we got the white egg with the penguin inside.
R2FBQZBE6DY1V3,the egg cracked open on the first day and we are on day 5 and the penguin just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
R2FBQZBE6DY1V3,the package says we can leave it in the water for up to three week.
R2FBQZBE6DY1V3,very interested to see just how big our little guy can get!
R2FBQZBE6DY1V3,this was a very neat little science project!

RRZIG2MI9OHH,i bought these for a 3rd bday construction theme party.
RRZIG2MI9OHH,"they fix the younger kids perfect but for the kids who were 6 and older, they were a little snug."
R19COCHZAMC2B1,decent detail for the money.
R19COCHZAMC2B1,i airbrushed mine to add greater detail and it really pops now.
R1NUD3EFEODGVF,this was not a disney product.
R1NUD3EFEODGVF,it had chinese writing on the tag and is very cheaply made.
R1NUD3EFEODGVF,i didnt receive the product that is described .
RSXS5GXXBU7D6,fast and just as described
R2QNZ255JMF0KI,bought this saucer chair 3 months ago for my 1 12 year old.
R2QNZ255JMF0KI,the bottom of the chair when flipped over is completely torncoming apart.
R2QNZ255JMF0KI,he uses this chair to watch his cartoons.
R2QNZ255JMF0KI,either i bought a defective product or the quality is very poor.
R2QNZ255JMF0KI,not happy at all with this purchase and it seems very unsafe for him to continue using it.
R2QNZ255JMF0KI,i attached a photo.
R2862WTGK6LY8Y,"did not realize wands were only 6"".,, but they are cute and well made and very sparkly."
R2KDH2ZYU56AD0,she was very happy with this gift!
R2KDH2ZYU56AD0,this was definitely a great find!
R307DXFL8UAOWP,i was super excited to finally get this.
R307DXFL8UAOWP,i took it out of the box and it broke in my hands.
R307DXFL8UAOWP,"i didnt drop it, didnt bump it in to anything, just picked it up,...and it broke in my scrawny little hands that have trouble opening gatorade bottles."
R307DXFL8UAOWP,"super bummed, wouldnt purchase this particular one again."
R307DXFL8UAOWP,would have loved one though!
R26EHSE7QNNUN0,as expected.
R19ERZCE46DLYT,awsome purchase my step son and i love this track it shipped really fast and is so cool keep in mind it is the size of a 4x8 sheet of plywood it is huge

R1U78BPMTIST0L,super cuddly little fella.
R1U78BPMTIST0L,dimensions are accurate.
R1U78BPMTIST0L,"my 15 month old son loves ""rex"""
RK72H9CYFE62Y,"3 stars.the figure looks pretty cool, but he has some minor difficulty holding his staff."
RK72H9CYFE62Y,"speaking of his staff, the orb on the bottom is rather misaligned, making it look off center."
RK72H9CYFE62Y,"the articulation is somewhat limited, but its good enough, i suppose."
RK72H9CYFE62Y,just dont expect too many dynamic poses.im starting to see that all these matty figures dont have good engineering.
RK72H9CYFE62Y,but nostalgia usually wins me over.the only reason i decided to get him was because hes basically an original concept design for the character.
R3DFUJO0TRXSKQ,my daughter says that this toy is very loud.
R3DFUJO0TRXSKQ,"additionally, the mouse doesnt like to stay in the wheel, after a few rotations is just comes back out again."
R3DFUJO0TRXSKQ,"when in the main cage, the mouse often falls over, forcing her to open the cage up again."
R3DFUJO0TRXSKQ,"according to her, the toy is fun and cute, but most kids would be better off with just a mouse on its own, without the cage."
R1MJSACZ9Z8DZT,exceptional comfort.
R1MJSACZ9Z8DZT,"crazy color combo, but function prevails."
R1MJSACZ9Z8DZT,its awesome.
R1R7E4UXZAGWKA,a must have for young budding architects.
R3SSUZXWJE863,these were old and sticky almost all of them popped when i went to get them blown up at party city.
R3SSUZXWJE863,the people there said they must have been really old and stored in bad conditions.
R25MP089IXEVM0,"game arrived as promised, and in excellent condition."
R25MP089IXEVM0,it is a fun game as i expected.

R2JPOJ0LJ909B1,"i gotta say, this things is durable."
R2JPOJ0LJ909B1,my son is 2 years of age and loves iron man so i go him this thinking it was expensive for a action figure but it was well worth the money .
R2JPOJ0LJ909B1,"my son bathes with it , throws it on the floor every minute or two ."
R2JPOJ0LJ909B1,im surprised its still intact.
R2JPOJ0LJ909B1,paint on the head is alittle scratched but by far the best toy he has had without breaking .
R2A02FY966QNB7,"really liked it, but it already has a hole, so it is only good for one season."
R2B6NECCHY0QU4,we love this!
R2B6NECCHY0QU4,"stores a lot of toys, and my daughter loves the design."
RH3AIUGTC9PID,got this for my 6yo at xmas.
RH3AIUGTC9PID,both of my daughters love it and play with it constantly.
RH3AIUGTC9PID,"especially my 4yo.sturdy, detailed and of great quality."
RH3AIUGTC9PID,dolls for perfectly.
R18YW15Q3GFHAB,this is a good swing.
R18YW15Q3GFHAB,perhaps the ropes could be a little more durable and a little padding around the edges to give it some traction for the rider and it would be a great swing?
R18YW15Q3GFHAB,"for now, its a fun toy that is being enjoyed."
R18YW15Q3GFHAB,"for kids who arent stable enough to stand on it, sitting works just fine for having fun and spinning around, but it is a little slippery, which is why i mentioned traction."
R18YW15Q3GFHAB,"i am constantly reminding ""hold on, hold on, hold on!"""
R18YW15Q3GFHAB,"i like that theres a small hole in the center of it that allows water to drain, avoiding any standing water issues."
R18YW15Q3GFHAB,"i may just add some shower stickers to create that traction, so i can stop the nervousness i feel when the spinning and swinging gets a little out of my comfort zone."
R18YW15Q3GFHAB,i do recommend it with caution for the smaller kids who ride.
R250R5NMF1PFU5,"easy to put up, no problems with slipping, good size"
R21000FKG45QDH,horrible.
R21000FKG45QDH,it came broken.
R21000FKG45QDH,the plastic lock mechanism didnt work.
R21000FKG45QDH,you get what you pay for but this was worthless.
R21000FKG45QDH,id rate it zero stars if that were possible.
R2CJ8E5703B3W7,this piece adds another dimension to his track set.
R3MX9JECT9AP5W,after a couple of months i can now say that this product is excellent.
R3MX9JECT9AP5W,all of the parts are very well designed.
R3MX9JECT9AP5W,also the light and siren give it a perfect experience.
R3MX9JECT9AP5W,my son kid loves it.
R26G8TXLQNNI2O,my 19 month old loves this tool set.
R26G8TXLQNNI2O,hes constantly playing with the tools and enjoys the sounds it makes.
R26G8TXLQNNI2O,"along with vtech, its hard to go wrong with leapfrog."
R26G8TXLQNNI2O,good quality for the price.
R26G8TXLQNNI2O,highly recommended.
RDP63CPWTVOTT,my daughter loved these.
RDP63CPWTVOTT,tons of fun!

R30XFFHCKUTGXV,bought for granddaughters 2nd birthday.
R30XFFHCKUTGXV,she loves it.
R30XFFHCKUTGXV,it was very easy to assemble and is pretty sturdy.
R22FBN8ANDBMGK,"really like the card, recommend adding it to your collection."
RM66MKK46SALL,this product is fantastic!
RM66MKK46SALL,my 6 year old was able to do everything by herself except fill a thing with hot water from the faucet.
RM66MKK46SALL,no microwave or stove needed.
RM66MKK46SALL,my daughter loved the independence she had with using this.
RM66MKK46SALL,shes excited to make chocolates as gifts for the holidays.
RM66MKK46SALL,this is very educational for young children.
RM66MKK46SALL,"they learn to follow instructions, that are very easy to follow, pictures explain every step."
RM66MKK46SALL,"also they learn about measuring, measuring how much chocolate to add without going over."
RM66MKK46SALL,"also, we added food coloring so learned about making different colors."
RM66MKK46SALL,"another important thing was learning to wait patiently, which was probably the hardest part for my daughter."
RM66MKK46SALL,we set a timer and she had to wait.
RM66MKK46SALL,after everything was done she had to clean it all up.
RM66MKK46SALL,i love the fact that she could do this on her own.
RM66MKK46SALL,its really cute too!
RM66MKK46SALL,theres many different chocolate shapes you can make.
RM66MKK46SALL,we did receive this for review but review is 100 honest opinion.
RM66MKK46SALL,highly recommend.
R3GJUMI25N33GI,im really impressed with how well this rolls even on carpet!
R3GJUMI25N33GI,most ride on toys dont stand a chance on carpet so i really didnt have the highest hopes for this one but i was pleasantly surprised.
R3GJUMI25N33GI,"i got this for a little girls first birthday, she was really excited to climb on it and push it around."
R3GJUMI25N33GI,it makes a really cute and easy push toy too until they learn how to use their feet.
R3GJUMI25N33GI,"its the perfect size too, my 11 month olds toes just barely hit the floor but he is rather small."
R3GJUMI25N33GI,the little girl i got it for was able to sit and comfortably reach the floor with no problem.
R3GJUMI25N33GI,really cute and simple toys are the way to go.
R3GJUMI25N33GI,and you really cant beat the little tikes brand.
R3GJUMI25N33GI,"you know youre getting a high quality toy from a trusted company, not something cheap or junky that doesnt work or is going to break in a week."
R3GJUMI25N33GI,even the antennae are sturdy.
R3GJUMI25N33GI,i would absolutely recommend this for little ones!
R2ALPOOF2HVUH,excelent dor my toodler
R17S28EZPG10AD,i thought this would be really great.
R17S28EZPG10AD,but it does not work as i expected.
R17S28EZPG10AD,when you throw it it just drops right away it doesnt sail a long distance like it says it does.
R17S28EZPG10AD,there are better toys to spend your money on.
R17S28EZPG10AD,"take it from the mom of 6 sons, there are better toys than this one."
R3JKZI2A9W7VO1,perfect childrens gifts
R3Q4UNZIBXOHVW,very fun to fly and learn.
R3Q4UNZIBXOHVW,has to be pretty much no wind at all to make it worth it.
RYIZNZL36S7T6,my 11 year old granddaughter and i love to play this card game.
RXXLCXHC95ZB2,"mine has a defect where, when it glows in the dark it has big splotch you can see."
R15UIZHVQRI4GL,my daughter loved it!it was delivered fast
R2JLUIRAULN17O,this gun is fun to use and packs a punch.
R2JLUIRAULN17O,the mega darts hit pretty hard as far as nerf darts go and whistle as they are travelling through the air.
R2JLUIRAULN17O,the gun looks cool and is easy to fire.
R2JLUIRAULN17O,you can either pump it and fire when ready or just hold the trigger and keep pumping it to fire one dart after another very quickly.
R2JLUIRAULN17O,the hardest part is reloading the 10 round drum but once you do it a few times you will adapt.
R2JLUIRAULN17O,"my wife likes using the gun, my 8 year old son likes using the gun, and i like using the gun."
R2JLUIRAULN17O,so overall we all like it and would recommend it.
RRFZQKRF9843T,easy to put together.
RRFZQKRF9843T,"it seems very sturdy so far, and im happy with my purchase."
RCX4X2CHRUUTI,really disappointed.
RCX4X2CHRUUTI,there were many land animals in the package...almost half the order.
RCX4X2CHRUUTI,"a lot of repeats, too!"
R11FD7QOCV5IVO,my grandson really likes this cap gun.
R11FD7QOCV5IVO,loves the 12shot caps it takes!
RGR90YEIQU8FQ,what we got does not match the picture and the boat does not stay together at all

RN8LIVDY416TL,nice activity for a birthday party.
RN8LIVDY416TL,"note  there arent many keychains in this, so order enough for your group."
RN8LIVDY416TL,"also, no extra sheets to compensate for mistakes."
RZFJRV0LV826L,hybrid means it will not fit a driver.
R1ZU4R04DQCIFY,"cute toy, looks a bit flimsy but kids dont care about that."
R1ZU4R04DQCIFY,my daughter loved this.
RU251FLGACDLQ,great!
RKBBG5P4C1ZYD,so cute
R3CN6AN1UGYQTX,really cool
R16DND4J70F6L4,i was a bit hesitant with this.
R16DND4J70F6L4,"my son loves legos, mega bloks, and building things like that."
R16DND4J70F6L4,"but we had tried a few &34learning&34 type sets before, the notable failures were one that taught about alternative energy cars, the other that was not as bad as that was one that used rubber bands for power, letting you make a plane, a car, a boat... but each one i tried seemed better than the last, so i hoped my luck would hold out here, and the third would be the charm, or at least be better than what came before.it doesnt come like the other building kits with a bunch of parts in a bag."
R16DND4J70F6L4,"parts are in bags, but theres also a big slide out tray that everything is on inside the box, and that has a smaller four piece tray in it, that keeps things separated.i was surprised at ultimately how few parts there are."
R16DND4J70F6L4,this really does make for simple building of all the models.
R16DND4J70F6L4,"everything is built around a central motor piece, the gears and such being placed around it in various ways depending on what youre building.things go together well, and the instructions for the mechanical side are very clear and concise."
R16DND4J70F6L4,"the &34body&34 parts are a bit more tricky, but it specifies which are &34mountain&34 and &34valley&34 folds pretty clearly with different colors and patterns for the lines where the crease is on the pictures in the instruction book."
R16DND4J70F6L4,"and while i was a bit skeptical, they really did work out pretty well.the mechanics are simple and easy for a kid to wrap their mind around."
R16DND4J70F6L4,"but my sons favorite was the orangutan have to admit, that was my favorite too.as another reviewer said, the replay value is limited, since once youve done one of them, successive builds dont really have as much of a thrill for them."
R16DND4J70F6L4,"the exception i found to this is when someone visits  family or his friends, he does enjoy building another time, being the &34teacher the second time around.theyre fun, and the price isnt bad considering how many animals you get to do here."
R16DND4J70F6L4,"its a great way for young kids to see some simple engineering in work.fun, and the price isnt bad considering how many animals you get to do here."
R16DND4J70F6L4,its a great way for young kids to see some simple engineering in work.
R25PO5MEIMDOSI,"its cute, but hard to put together and flimsy."
R25PO5MEIMDOSI,"my twins are fireman sam happy, but are going to destroy this in less than a week."
R25PO5MEIMDOSI,"the plastic is thin, the lights and sirens barely work, and the pieces are super small and cheaply made."
R25PO5MEIMDOSI,dont buy.
R25PO5MEIMDOSI,find another more durable fire station and use the fireman sam figurines!
R3TPH6VOMBDHSP,love this sandbox.
R3TPH6VOMBDHSP,"my 16year old grandson put it together for his 5,6 and 3 year old cousins."
R11MIVAQF69WAJ,"this is a fantastic kit for young minds, it allows for the exploration of the engineering of locomotion."
R11MIVAQF69WAJ,"the quadruped, biped and armoverarm methods are explored in this one kit."
R11MIVAQF69WAJ,essentially a simple robotics kit that allows for the remote controlled robot to be constructed in different forms to demonstrate the variations of locomotion.its an excellent kit and the construction method is similar to the old style advanced lego kits.
R11MIVAQF69WAJ,"anyone can manage this method of construction and, given that the kit only requires one motor and one remote, i expect that nearly anyone can manage to build all three bots and truly enjoy the exploration.if you are one of those people that used to build simple mechanical bots in middleschool, then you might have a blast helping your kids explore the great kit... and the others.this is a great educational toy that i can recommend very highly."
R2G73T3R17044P,my grandson loves it.
RMFBAXKIHEOJW,no they didnt.
RMFBAXKIHEOJW,showed online as colored said nothing about coloring them yourself.
RMFBAXKIHEOJW,very disappointed sent them back which was also a big hassle
R3711EF0EXOO00,needed for a project.
R1SM0OOQ1MLCVZ,there is a lot of controversy surrounding this game.
R1SM0OOQ1MLCVZ,games workshop killed off a long running although very unprofitable game in order to make way for age of sigmar.
R1SM0OOQ1MLCVZ,this has left many veterans with a bad taste in their mouth.
R1SM0OOQ1MLCVZ,"however, as a new gamer this set is a winner."
R1SM0OOQ1MLCVZ,i have successfully recruited several other new players to the game as well.
R1SM0OOQ1MLCVZ,"less than $100 gets you two unique armies, a rule book, a colorful intro book filled with pictures of models and lore, as well as some basic scenarios."
R1SM0OOQ1MLCVZ,the beauty of aos is that you can play the game with small groups of units.
R1SM0OOQ1MLCVZ,for a fun and engrossing experience this game delivers!
RPKZJHYPRILSC,good quality product at a good price .
R1S1N3SEHAHRU,amazing look and sexy sleek leather finish.
R1S1N3SEHAHRU,"good quality, sturdy build and clear emboss."

R3UBVWVM600TUL,was perfect!
R3UBVWVM600TUL,couldnt ask for better!
R3UBVWVM600TUL,thank you so much.
R1VFV5Y9Q3DNSD,very cute.
R1VFV5Y9Q3DNSD,but it arrived bent out around the eyes so does not work properly.
R1VFV5Y9Q3DNSD,water still got in.
R1VFV5Y9Q3DNSD,also straps are not very secure.
R1VFV5Y9Q3DNSD,one side kept sliding out when we tried to put them on.
R1VFV5Y9Q3DNSD,had to try several times then ended up taking the strap completely out and rearranging it so it would stay.
R3AI450YK3DHQ8,the 5th seahorse i purchased for friends and family.
R3AI450YK3DHQ8,greatest item to sooth a child!
R38UESEIOC8L5C,i have very small adult hands and these fit perfect.

R38IV4OTDXD1QE,precious!
R2TKMDVZR7BE1J,great product.
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,"i like these, dont get me wrong.first off, they are very big, and heavy."
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,my arms are definitely going to be getting a work out with these poi.
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,it makes them harder to swing at times as well.
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,"when watching people on youtube use these i assumed they were small, and light."
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,well we all know what happens when you assume!
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,so the weight was unexpected.the &34pod&34 itself makes contact with the other poi happen very easily.
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,"so when your doing a butterfly, for instance, your going to hit at some point."
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,"for someone like me, that isnt very helpful taking them apart isnt very difficult, but it takes a bit of effort to pull them out of the pod."
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,"i thought i broke them at first when i tried, but the ring is supposed to come off.all in all, these are good."
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,"the patterns are cool, and they look awesome at night."
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,"the recharging is wonderful, and so far battery life has been good."
R1ZZVVZ6DO0ZWG,"the ability to clean them is fine, but switching from the &34crystal&34 pois to these &34pod&34 pois was a change  give them a try!"
R38MB8HT4BN2QM,very minimal damage at the top of the card.
R2H0Z7Q9QDMIY,not very details model.

RGAKMVLORRKYM,this bounce house is wonderful!
RGAKMVLORRKYM,my boys 3 &5 are loving it!
RGAKMVLORRKYM,great way to burn off some of that energy!
RGAKMVLORRKYM,i think i will even be able to move some furniture and set it up inside during bad weather.
RGAKMVLORRKYM,"it was also very easy to set up...which was a plus with 2 excited kids who wanted to ""help""."
R5WQVS2GGT59E,received damaged piece and not working bad not recommended to buy.
RC1SNGQZYB7SH,"bought for my gdaughter, she seemed to enjoy, she completely assemble in about 2 hours."
RC1SNGQZYB7SH,looking for something more challenging for her.
R3MH1J24SD9CGN,"these actually look better than the picture, and are so realistic, my wife said they looked delicious."
R3MH1J24SD9CGN,"i got these for my cousins, who are serious eraser collectors."
R3MH1J24SD9CGN,"they love them, and since i try and get iwakos for them every holiday season, they love me too phighly recommended!"
R3MH1J24SD9CGN,!arigato.
R2W1IZXSAV98J4,perfect!
R2G3533KSDXR1J,so i bought the puzzle and put the thing together and it was missing two pieces.
R2G3533KSDXR1J,two pieces.
R2G3533KSDXR1J,so i had to bust it up and toss it.
R2G3533KSDXR1J,very disappointing.
RO8TVJM4JPTG6,"not the best toy binoculars in the world, but they work well for a 3 years old."
RO8TVJM4JPTG6,"i ordered these nature bound toy binoculars for my 3 year old grandson after i purchased a pair of better, more expensive ones for his 6 year old brother."
RO8TVJM4JPTG6,"these binoculars made him happy and worked well enough to make him feel like he was using ""real"" binoculars like his brother!"
RO8TVJM4JPTG6,the best part about these nature bound binoculars is that they are really sturdy!!!
RO8TVJM4JPTG6,"theyve taken a lot of falls without breaking, cracking or coming apart."
RO8TVJM4JPTG6,"my little guy doesnt quite get the concept of being able to ""see"" distant things like birds or baseball outfielders but he really enjoys looking at ""giant"" people and objects when he focuses on things that are relatively close."
RO8TVJM4JPTG6,"all in all, im pleased with how sturdy these are and how well they work for a 3 year old!"
R1ECEIJZT942ND,i had one as a kid so i thought me daughter would like one too.she rarely plays with it but seems to enjoy it when she does.good quality and just as i remember.
R3JIS8ZHF4E7C3,we ended up buying two of these for the twins.
R3JIS8ZHF4E7C3,"they really enjoy the hot air balloon as it lights up, plays music and put different ponies in it!"
R1V8GCKXYCUPYM,this figure is one of my favorites in the sailor moon s.h.
R1V8GCKXYCUPYM,figuarts lineup.
R1V8GCKXYCUPYM,"tuxedo masks coloring is perfectly executed and there have been no defects with the joints, arms, or legs like there was with my sailor uranus."
R1V8GCKXYCUPYM,changing his face is completely different from that of the sailor scouts.
R1V8GCKXYCUPYM,you actually remove his whole head instead of just the face itself.
R1V8GCKXYCUPYM,the boxing is rather large compared to the sailor scouts and thankfully had a masculine look to fit his style.
R2MD5GHKU21HYJ,"i got my order, thank you"
R16SE8YHFGKV28,great product
R3ECXZRHGDFVSP,i purchased this as a christmas gift for my daughter so she has not got to play with it yet.
R3ECXZRHGDFVSP,i can say that it arrived in perfect condition and i am very pleased with the size.
R3ECXZRHGDFVSP,i will post a link to a video review of the toy so you can see it in action.
R3ECXZRHGDFVSP,i have nothing to do with the video but i thought it would be a helpful addition to the review.
R18RU4OAZSN59H,this car is awesome!!!
R18RU4OAZSN59H,my 3 year old loooves it
RAB73FDMA9TAO,excellent quality in a flex sleeve in a hard sleeve.

R3P0YSWDIKYJGN,delivered on time.
R3P0YSWDIKYJGN,product exactly what i was looking for.
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,"this comes in the mail in a small box with the fabric canvas folded, paints, brushes, number guide, and a tiny 3 14"" x 4 14"" picture of completed product."
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,the canvas appears to be possibly a type of vinyl laminated to an even weave fabric.
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,it comes folded up & the folds are creased into the fabric.
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,"it has to be stretched to eliminate the folds, which involves purchasing something to stretch it with."
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,"i used a frame meant for working cross stitch or needlepoint, which meant rolling it onto the bars & having to roll it several times to put the creases in the center & roll & lock tight, then turn it sideways & repeat process."
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,all but the center crease came out this way & that is more of a roll in the fabric now than a crease.
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,so i am going to try putting it back on the frame again for a longer period of time.
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,i left it on for each crease for 1 day.
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,this is timely & im sure there is something out there that is meant for stretching fabric.
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,possibly a quilting product?
R3LPD3RLYZKRKI,"i did paint a small area to see how the paint went onto this type of canvas, and it goes on smooth & looks fine."
RT14SYEPPYA64,my son loves my little ponies anx he has spent hours playing with this little pony.

RGVHYIOMIIOZN,games and this was a great addition.
R3111AOEMVEQ46,i am disappointed that the majority of this item is actually plastic.
R3111AOEMVEQ46,"besides the center track piece only the sides are ""wood"", and those side pieces look more like thin mfd."
R3111AOEMVEQ46,"for the price i would think they could have made this more like the stone draw bridge, which really is almost all wood."
R13H85CBEQ9PM6,adorable.
R13H85CBEQ9PM6,just what i wanted!
R13H85CBEQ9PM6,delivered in a timely fashion.
R6BI5K9AE4Q14,my son got his with his amazon gift cards and it broke the same day.
R6BI5K9AE4Q14,do not buy as it is overpriced.

RX0J2PRC3SZTT,it took me about 45 minutes to put together.
RX0J2PRC3SZTT,i wish they would ship these toys all preassembled!
R3TDW591DWTB7B,"its a two pack, but one of the batteries died after just three charges."
R3TDW591DWTB7B,at least one of them still works though.
R3TDW591DWTB7B,"still, can not see any noticeable additional fly time when compared to the 500mah battery that the x5 came with."
R3TDW591DWTB7B,guess i can not complain considering the price... going to just pay the extra for the oem next time...

R3D12HNF1A6H7F,having loads of fun with it.
R3D12HNF1A6H7F,"my only issue is, after 12 flights, the controller fails to stay on unless pressure applied to the onoff switch."
R3D12HNF1A6H7F,"while flying, i must keep my thumb adding pressure to the switch."
R3D12HNF1A6H7F,"if it losses pressure, all control is lost."
R3D12HNF1A6H7F,not too terrible if drone is high enough to allow enough time to reconnect with controller while falling.
R280U3Z83J4DHF,fun for playdate
R3DSTPSL9DRMJ7,my kids 4 & 18 months both love this toy!
R19HZNZLJTR5Q7,great quality and really brings out the look on my ms01d.

R1VCHLQ385BUYN,"well made, attractiveto my granddaughter, and seems durable."
R1VCHLQ385BUYN,i needed to talk to the distributor about an address correction and they were very accommodating and polite.
R1VCHLQ385BUYN,the set is reasonably priced and our 3 year old should get some years of play with it.
R1VCHLQ385BUYN,may be too small for a 56 year old.
R2IZCM5XKUX556,wonderful product
R328PZ7KJ3968N,not worth the money.
R328PZ7KJ3968N,they are tiny and even i as an adult can barely pull the pieces apart once put together.
R35KHH9KHS536E,why are bath toys so expensive?
R35KHH9KHS536E,it was an ok set.
R35KHH9KHS536E,"i dont like things that water gets trapped in, though."

R36SG8P7QG4XA,kiddo love it
R22NYDXYGQQYYS,sturdy and cute toy.
R22NYDXYGQQYYS,"my 2.5 year old liked the moving parts but was easily bored while playing alone as it was hard for him to simultaneously hold the ship, dolls and move the other parts."
R22NYDXYGQQYYS,i received this toy at no cost but probably wouldnt recommend it since my son didnt play with it much.
R3IC0B9AQUEZD0,"we bought two of these as gifts, one was smashed when received so we sent it back."
R3IC0B9AQUEZD0,after we received the replacement plane i wrapped it up for my soon to be 4 yo sons birthday party.after he opened it he was very excited we put it on the charger only to discover the next day that the plane wouldnt charge.
R3IC0B9AQUEZD0,we try it on the other charger that we gave as a gift and it still wouldnt charge.
R3IC0B9AQUEZD0,we decided to send it back only to discover the 30 day return was 2 days past.if you give this as a gift make sure to check it before wrapping it.
R36GL5IVMNBHRH,these are amazing to use!
R36GL5IVMNBHRH,my new favorite marker.
R36GL5IVMNBHRH,"enables me to color in small, tight areas easily."

R31HOC7DQLIS2B,this was a birthday gift and she loves it!!!!
R31HOC7DQLIS2B,!
R3GXCD8MBJGEMN,this is a wicked fast little boat.
R3GXCD8MBJGEMN,dont drive it in a pool.
R3GXCD8MBJGEMN,i poked a hole in the liner.
R23WPMASLZE2PC,the young child this was bought for really enjoys playing his toy cars and trucks on it.
R3B2I1BNL9ASSK,my nephew lover it!
R1OZDZZ26WURH6,shipped fast and i was happy with the product
R3JBG7QU7U1RSW,these ducks are made from hard plastic and are low quality.
R3JBG7QU7U1RSW,they have small holes and take on water.
R3JBG7QU7U1RSW,"after weeks of trying to dry them out, they still have water in them."
R3JBG7QU7U1RSW,i would not recommend for more than one use.
R2XKMLHEG7Z402,my kids loved this.
R2XKMLHEG7Z402,lots of sparkly play doh and tons of molds.
R2XKMLHEG7Z402,"one star comes off because its hard to get play do to press out of the skirt, and once youre done with that its tough to get the skirt to come off the little pedestal."
R2ZS23JDV2UZG0,great details.
R2ZS23JDV2UZG0,just the size i was looking for.
R1SM4718S8V66N,"love these different dot to dot books,very interesting to do."
RWDU6PS2141EE,these were perfect.
RWDU6PS2141EE,my boys love them!
R3U2A2AH18IHTE,it came in rock hard pieces so i thought if i play with it than it might come softer so i tried and it came a bit softer but when you stop playing with it the next time it was rock hard again so i decided to put some water in and i put way to much so it was wet and disgusting so i googled what you can do so it said put some corn starch and it worked so i tried using it but it stunk so bad and it didnt work like how its supposed to work so i just threw the whole thing in the garbage and went to five below and got regular kinetic sand it it felt so much better and i couldnt believe why i bought royal play sand i would recommend not to buy thus sand tou can just buy regular kinetic sand that is way better than royal play sand.
R1W3I6HUVU5MXX,gift
R2VJFH056SHMLY,i purchased this for my nephews birthday.
R2VJFH056SHMLY,"it appears to be well made, and he loved it!"
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"this cube is decent, but it doesnt spin as freely as some others."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"the build is quality, and stickerless is always a perk."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"it has yellow opposite white, which is my preference."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"it has never jammed up on me, which is great."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"when i opened mine it had a light coating of oily residue on it, so i assume it came prelubricated."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"as far as speed cubes go, though, it turns a bit slowly."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"much better than say, rubiks, but my dayan ii guhong spins circles around this thing."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"adjusting the tension is very easy on this cube, as well."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,each center cube has a panel on it with a screw under it and the panels pop off easily without disassembling the whole cube.
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"though it doesnt spin as freely as my dayan, it spins loosely, if that makes sense."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,"it doesnt take much force to spin it, but it turns in a controlled manner, so i use both cubes at different times for different reasons."
REA4AU3F6LKTV,i received a discount on this item for review purposes all review content is my own and not influenced by the discount or seller in any way.
R3UMTZF03MD57W,"well made, and will make a good riding broom for the wicked witch of the west."

R3E2U0QQ59FUHZ,amazing toy for toddlers and older kids.
R3E2U0QQ59FUHZ,"the basic set of 12 shapes allows up to 171 different designs, ranging from simple to pretty advanced which might need adults to assist for younger kids."
R3E2U0QQ59FUHZ,if you add a second identical set then the possibilities are endless as far as i can see.
R3E2U0QQ59FUHZ,"sturdy, well made, colorful and attention catching, exactly what toys for toddlers should be."
R39TUIXGQI38CJ,classic look
R1LK1F60G3QZ8D,my 3rd graders teacher messaged us the first week of class asking where we purchased thiswe purchase our first one at office max as her daughter was already having issues with her crayon box falling apart.

R21EQ77S9Y41DN,this is not an authentic figuarts zero action figure.
R21EQ77S9Y41DN,"if you are a collector, stay away."
R21EQ77S9Y41DN,"if you just want something that looks similar to the real thing, good ahead..."
RBM6LRU09687J,the key is cool good size and everything.
RBM6LRU09687J,the cord is kind of weird its like a fake leather or something but replacing it isnt a problem for how good the key is and how relatively cheep it is also.
R36H0G4UNXZ84Q,i purchased this for a gift for my 5 year old nephew  his reaction  thats just what i wanted!

R2BG18VTZERNFA,great product love the quality
REKHB2GM47AXB,"ive played through this several times now, and enjoy it a lot."
REKHB2GM47AXB,"the choices of when to spend life, when to destroy cards, and how to deal with the various hazards and pirates give you a lot of strategic options in a relatively simple rule set.the art on the cards is great, very amusing and evocative of whatever the cards describing, and they handle easily while also not taking up too much space."
REKHB2GM47AXB,theyre like small tarot cards much taller than they are wide.
REKHB2GM47AXB,"cards are of good quality, thick and with nice printing.the life tokens are painted wood eurogamestyle pieces, very cool and different from the generic designs found in other games."
REKHB2GM47AXB,"they come in a resealable bag.the three miniboardstiles for the different stacks of cards are nicely printed and have a bit of reference material on them, as well.this game gets extra points for having a rather small box, minimal instructions, and components that can be easily and quickly put back in the box."
REKHB2GM47AXB,"the miniboards concept works a lot better and lasts a lot longer than a quadfolding board.overall, great solo game."
REKHB2GM47AXB,fun to play and fun to watch others play.
REKHB2GM47AXB,"robinson has a lot of character, and the multiple challenge levels and scoring system add even more replayability to this."
REKHB2GM47AXB,its worth checking out!
R3AGGMUQY4XEZI,love it!

R24TFI9LKRV93M,my 13 year old nephew likes nothing.he went crazy over this drone.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"there are so many great tablets built with an intelr atomtm based processor, including the kurio xtreme tablet for kids."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,i got to check out the kurio xtreme with my family and it has been a hit.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"even my husband has used it, and he usually avoids kids &34toys.&34 well the kurio xtreme is not a toy, it is a beast of a tablet thanks to the intelr atomtm based processor."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,it loads up right away and downloads apps before i realize it.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"speed is not the only thing that i like about the kurio xtreme, there are lots of great features on it.features i like on the kurio xtremecomes preloaded with more than 90 apps including popular games like fruit ninja, subway surfer and cut the rope 2. you get access to over 150 ebooks as well.kurio genius parental controls."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"you can set up different profiles for your kids and decide their internet access, apps they can play and times they can play on the device."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,this is awesome because as a busy mom i dont have time to sit and monitor what each child is doing on their tablets or if im not with them i dont have to worry.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"my kids bring their tablets to friends houses and their grandparents and with kurio xtreme parental controls and profiles, its like i am watching over them.going along with parental controls, kurio has the kurio genius internet filtering system."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"this filters, categorizes and updates 450 million websites daily to make sure kids are staying safe online and not viewing anything they are not supposed to."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,parents can set the strictness of controls and lessen controls as kids grow.7inch touch screen with 5point multitouch.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"lets face it, kids want to touch screens, its being the norm now that even with our nontouch screen computer they try to touch the screen."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,we havent had any issues with the touch screen.android operating system  this is great because not only do you get the google play store but also the amazon app store.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"kurio also has their own app store you can get kidfriendly apps from.create up to 8 profiles, perfect for everyone in the family."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"yes this is not just a kids tablet, i can log in onto my profile and check my email, play a game, surf the web or go on my social networks."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"then when i am done, i log out and my kids can log into their own profiles and just access what i allow them to.1st tablet with body motion gaming!"
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,this is seriously awesome.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,my whole family has done this and it is a great way to unwind.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"we just prop on the kitchen counter with the included stand and pick a game under motion sport such as skiing, soccer, swimming or running and we start moving."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,a picture of you pops up on the bottom right and you have to move to make your character move on the screen.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"the faster you move, the faster your player will move!"
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,its funny to see us working up a sweat playing a game in the kitchen!includes protective bumper.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,i appreciate when tablets come with a case because it is one less thing i need to buy and i can let my kids use it right out of the box without worrying.categorize games for profiles.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,you can categorize where the games fit.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"the categories include games, educational, media, ebooks and more."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,you can then go a step further and choose which categories are subject to time management.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"for example, lets say you are fine with your child reading ebooks all day or anything in the educational category but for the games category you want it limited to certain hours of the day  well you can do that!what i wish it hadi do wish it was a little bit bigger but 7 inches is a decent size.it would be nice too if there was a stand that popped out from the back rather than came separate so we dont have to prop it when we dont have the stand with us.more body motion games.overall, i really like the features of the kurio xtreme."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,it makes it really easy to manage my kids on it and we allhave fun using it.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"for the price of just over $100, id say its a good value and it can be a tablet that grows with your child or one that all your child share if thats possible with their own profiles."
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,there is so much that can be customized on this tablet from the profile screens to what games the categories go in.
R1EM7H1EP4C6N2,"i feel like we havent even scratched the surface of what this tablet will do, especially because one of my three kids is usually on it so i dont get much play time on it.i received this product complimentary in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.have fun using it."

R2BWIC54VIFKB5,worked fine initially.
R2BWIC54VIFKB5,"but after a while, it stopped realized that the top body had got a little away from the bottom half."

R2BWIC54VIFKB5,my daughter loves it.
R2BWIC54VIFKB5,i have to keep replacing the batteries.
R33VNZIWC5REZ6,"fun game for the family, but recommend for those 6 and up at least as can be challenging for kids to come up with the right questions to narrow down what their picture is...."
R26F8SFEXFVW6U,"such a fun game  unpredictable, challenging, hysterical!"
R3FHIH7CYDVKE7,"after flying a few times, one of the motors had to be replaced."
R3FHIH7CYDVKE7,it took about 2 hours to replace the motor.
R3FHIH7CYDVKE7,"after replacing the motor, the quadcopter worked fine for a few minutes, but then another motor went bad and needs to be replaced."
R3FHIH7CYDVKE7,there were no severe crashes.
R3FHIH7CYDVKE7,im spending much more time dealing with bad motors than flying.
R3FHIH7CYDVKE7,"so, im taking this as a loss and looking for a more reliable quadcopter."
R1PXLQ0K737PG2,nice

R2G1FKGFRJZFU5,and ive still got a lot of love for a place that knows its ridiculous and capitalizes on it.
R2G1FKGFRJZFU5,each card in this deck have hysterical quotes on them that could easily have been spouted by hipsters in austin or portland.
R2G1FKGFRJZFU5,or seattle... and the court cards depict thoroughly modern characters.

R28E982CZ86B6A,"we bought this to do prank on someone so we could easily blow up a low of balloons, but it ended up hurting instead of hurting"

RH9FSLRTYE5SB,videoid484dea32ddcb0bfc2030d37d500c4120we already own several smart wheels play sets.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,the video shows this smart wheels set combined with parts of 3 or 4 other smart wheels sets.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,in total we own about 78 different smart wheels sets.goodthe smart wheels design team is very ambitious.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,the new features are exciting.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,the best one is the remote controlled car.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"yes it only goes back and forth, but thats all you need."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,my child loves this feature and he can barely talk.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,its an awesome idea.the idea of having smart vehicles that talk and light up depending on the tracks indentation is really ingenious.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,this adds to the fun and education.the play set is somewhat interactive.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"it has lights and sounds, and the track triggers the smart wheels cars to start talking which is always cool.the environment is even more interactive with the car itself?"
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,what does this mean?
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"now in addition to making the cars talk while moving over tracks, when the car is moving using its own motor theres gears it can hit that activates an elevator, moving the car up 3 levels."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,theres even a cool pit stop that activates a bunch of gears like clock work.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,more on this in the bad section.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,theres even a really cool bridge unlike the others this one is perfect in execution as well as two track diverters another cool idea.it has some educational value.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"like the smart wheels garage, it sings learning songs and talks.there is a lot of creativity involved and even problem solving."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"it takes planing to be able to complete the construction of a smart wheels track, given what pieces you have and how much space is available to build it in."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"smart wheels is basically legos for cars, with the roads being the basic building blocks.you can take apart the play sets and store them.okwhile remote controlled car motor is stronger than the smart wheels train motor, its still too weak to move through a few existing smart wheels tracks that arent included in this set."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,this is a minor complaint and just a nice to have in the future feature.badbuggy interactive tracks the only new movement reacting tracks that work every time is the red bridge and the track diverters.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,unfortunately both the pit stop and the elevator ramp track are both victims of either poor design or manufacturing defects.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"with the pit stop, the gears dont always activate and the car gets stuck there."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"with the elevator, it only worked twice."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"every other time after, the car just shoots forward off of the elevator, making it useless."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"based on other reviews, it seems like vtech either didnt properly test these features or they just didnt care and just decided to ship them out."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,im not sure which scenario is more disturbing.there is a lot of trial and error when setting up smart wheels tracks for motorized smart wheels cars as opposed to smart wheels cars being moved manually.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"many times unless the tracks are just right, the remote controlled car will get stuck or go off the track on sharp curves and so on.smart wheels needs space, though you could always take them apart after play.this is one of the more expensive smart wheels sets, which is bad since unlike the other smart wheels play sets major pieces dont work.verdicti would try to purchase the draw bridge and the remote control car separately instead."
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,however if youre a big fan you really dont have much of a choice but to buy this set even with the flaws the moving bridge is totally worth it even though two major tracks dont work.
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"if youre not really familiar with smart wheels, i would start out with one of there other sets instead like the train set asinb00dkci1p6 vtech go!"
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,go!
RH9FSLRTYE5SB,"smart wheels train station playseti really wanted to rate this higher, but this just needs to be fixed."
R39R40J7E5DYMR,love this bunk bed and so does my 7 year old.

R19RJ938DBF8YV,brake in the middle after 5 minutes.
R3FX70T6MZXVZL,"very cute, looking forward to giving them to my son for his birthday, came earlier than expected."

R17UO1VTAKHP3S,all three of our boys love them.
R2X93RSO9XXK6J,came faster than i expected.
R2X93RSO9XXK6J,as one must be patient when ordering international it can take up to 46 weeks and came in about 3 or less in not sure but it came before the expected arrival date.
R2X93RSO9XXK6J,"kids love the plushie, waiting for my sons ordered thru another vendor."
R2X93RSO9XXK6J,its very soft and came well packaged.

R2GK8RS73QJZZ5,the box is quality and i am very pleased with it.
R3FR04VFHQUU9P,"well the main thing that i like about this toy, is that it is very solid, sturdy and requires little to no assembly."
R3FR04VFHQUU9P,it is also very big too.
R3FR04VFHQUU9P,the details on this are awesome.
R3FR04VFHQUU9P,you can play with this on the floor or even in the bath tub.
R3FR04VFHQUU9P,"kids really have to use their imagination with this because i can see them getting bored with this fast due to the lack of things this ship does.kids like a lot of sound effects, lights, movement, etc... when it comes to toys and this lacks it,so dont be surprised if this becomes another toy pushed to the side collecting dust after a few plays."
RSJDGBBFLHVE9,these tattoos were great for our sports party we had at camp.

R3KVCN372BEI8A,my little girl loved her horsey balloon!
R3KVCN372BEI8A,"it popped soon as it met the ceiling fan, but thats to be expected."
R1JKY2VIACUFM8,"i bought this as a gift for an ""under the sea"" themed nursery and think its perfect."
R1JKY2VIACUFM8,its so cute and extremely soft and cuddly.
R1JKY2VIACUFM8,i found myself wanting to cuddle it.
R1JKY2VIACUFM8,in my opinion the size is just right as well.
R1JKY2VIACUFM8,"its large enough that i a 53"" woman could comfortably cuddle it, but not so big as to overwhelm a child."
R1JKY2VIACUFM8,it appears to be well made and that it would be safe for a baby.
R1JKY2VIACUFM8,"the description even mentions the double bagged construction for the bean bag filling, and the lock washers on the eyes for safety."
R1JKY2VIACUFM8,i absolutely love this turtle.
R59PZ1Z7QN0U,bought as a present did not play with it
R2N4113JUG5I9T,funny
R2TC0KF10MTXGR,"the shopkins i received are not the ones pictured they are counterfiet and i know that characters may vary but these are not moose toys skopkins ,they are not on any of the the shopkin list.i filed a claim!"
R3PRHU5U8OGSS8,"there is so much you could expect for the price, but i did not expect for one of the glasses to come already detached from the stick."
R3PRHU5U8OGSS8,"thankfully they are glued with silicone and it was an easy fix, but still... i was originally going to give 3 stars for that but decided to give 4 because they were pretty cute and wellmade for the low price.despite of the detached glass, i would buy them again for another friends wedding, they look cute, easy to fix if they detach, and it was a lot of fun to wear them at our wedding reception."
R3KNFC8T0TV9AI,definitely worth getting.
R3KNFC8T0TV9AI,the large print cards and erratted tickets from the base game are worth the price alone.
R3KNFC8T0TV9AI,the extra tickets and game modes are an added bonus which make it feel like a whole new game.
RYMWVEEA3AR80,"cute, but child was bored of it very quickly."
R3AE7O7AA95NPB,best bubbles ever!
R3AE7O7AA95NPB,my nieces love these plus they take some home with them and play with them everyday
R2J0R5H9FWIOHD,goth barbie is cool.
R2Q6DOXSBTKFOI,much too thin to hold up an adult!
R2Q6DOXSBTKFOI,was very disappointed.
R3GXZH1FYNHX0V,nice as expected
R31OJZA420YISU,great addition to my collection.
R31OJZA420YISU,great honor for frank zappa and his ingenious way.
R3DGCPX7L78PQD,product is a snap together toy not of very high quality considering the price.
R3DGCPX7L78PQD,packaging was not gift box worthy.
R3DGCPX7L78PQD,it was the shipping box that it was shipped in.
R3DGCPX7L78PQD,i gave it three stars because my grandson likes it.
R3DGCPX7L78PQD,labels on the toy are not in english.
R3F83JWUWK9JBM,terrible.
R3F83JWUWK9JBM,it popped in midair within the first hour of playing with it.
R3E5KK2PRRJP3C,love
R2HOSPV1GJH2B1,kids love playing.
R2HOSPV1GJH2B1,help learn counting to check all fingers are still there.
R1IHG2UWH3EBOF,my granddaughters love unicorns.
R1IHG2UWH3EBOF,"they have a bunch of stuff ones, but no puppets."
R1IHG2UWH3EBOF,their eyes lit up when they saw them.
R1IHG2UWH3EBOF,"very soft material the right size for little hands,"
R1F1H22XSNJ9RC,i was expecting something that my 3 year old son can use on his own without cutting himself while learning how to use a pair of scissors.
R1F1H22XSNJ9RC,this does cut skin.
R1F1H22XSNJ9RC,it almost cut mine.
R1F1H22XSNJ9RC,this is a good pair of scissors for kids who already know how to cut.
R1F1H22XSNJ9RC,i wouldnt recommend for toddlers who are leaning to use scissors.
R29600RMN6MOA6,the plushcraft pillows are a great craft idea for kids!
R29600RMN6MOA6,it gave my grand daughter a great sense of accomplishment because she was able to do it without any help.
R29600RMN6MOA6,"the quality is super, so when the project is complete, the finished pillow looks and feels substantial."
R2MB75FSTZCB28,thanks
R3GS7SX7XH166G,very complicated to work
R15NYZI0W9MJZH,these expansion sets get better and better.
R15NYZI0W9MJZH,have all six sets and five crabs adjust humidity sets.
R18MJUM9G38P61,great deal
R1GHVJSTWJ6V65,great inside the pinata we made for our 5 year olds birthday
R3D0WPS9XGOHJW,my daughter absolutely loves her kidrobot bffs!
R1XB8HLQ9RUGT7,the helmet is cheap foam and the knee pads are not even close to plastic.
R1XB8HLQ9RUGT7,this is not worth the money and amazon should give us a credit for the false advertising.
R3P0UNJKYFA9B8,everything was as promised.
R3P0UNJKYFA9B8,thanks!
R2VCHFLJ7L0NN7,"husband put it together right away, currently on display over his bar"
R2NLFK9UNY75WC,daughter loves this set!
R2NLFK9UNY75WC,very good quality.
R2NLFK9UNY75WC,would buy from again
R1ATOP0BI7WAF7,my daughter is pretty hard on these dinosaurs they go with us everywhere and theyve stood up to a ton of play.
R1ATOP0BI7WAF7,"the fit and finish isnt what id call exceptional, but shes 2.5 and has never complained."
R2S2O5IIW9V55Q,bought this for my 12 year old son who loves the star craft video game.
R2S2O5IIW9V55Q,him and his older brother have played it a few times so far and love it!
RZENHL9DQU38I,this little guy is cute and greatly detailed.
RZENHL9DQU38I,the paint job is very good.
RZENHL9DQU38I,specially considering the price.
RZENHL9DQU38I,"its a bit lighter than i expected, but thats good because it makes moving easier."
R2YYMUNAUD41MQ,we like cards against humanity but the red deck feels like a bad imitation it insists on being gross in an adolescent way where cards allows escape hatches.
R2YYMUNAUD41MQ,it just seems like an insincere and imitative effort.
R3HU1NLWFU25UG,my grandson was very pleased with this playset.
R2HT6IOOT89ZLO,my two kids love this.
R2HT6IOOT89ZLO,"they are 1 and 2. the only show they demand to watch is, ""the monkey""."
R2HT6IOOT89ZLO,neither have ever shown any interest in a stuffed toy before.
R2HT6IOOT89ZLO,this one goes to bed with them every night.
R2HT6IOOT89ZLO,so glad i took a chance and ordered it.
R2HT6IOOT89ZLO,plus for some reason my dogs dont bother it.
R2HT6IOOT89ZLO,"dont know why, but what a relief, the monkey in the dogs mouth is not a good thing."
R2HT6IOOT89ZLO,soft and very cuddle worthy.
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,my daughter loved this.
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,my four year old squealed with delight when she opened it.
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,she found great delight in flinging bits of play doh all over the living room and when that got old she quickly began flinging anything else she could find all over the living room.
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,keep that in mind before purchasing this item.
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,"your kid will love it, but you will have bits and bobs of play doh flying around, probably getting squished into the carpet."
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,"that part wasnt fun, but her delight certainly was."
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,very enjoyable product.
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,the characters on the play doh cans was cute but there were four plastic molds that are separate that i could not figure out what they were supposed to represent?
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,"oh, wells."
R1P2VW8GJEPJCM,great product.
R3J8U2ZECIELEG,could not be any cuter!
R3J8U2ZECIELEG,"nice and bright, soft and a great size for your little collectors."
R3J8U2ZECIELEG,"i love his face, his giant eyes draw you in and keep a hold onto you."
R3J8U2ZECIELEG,"great quality and again, just take a look at that face !!"
R3J8U2ZECIELEG,!shipped fast and the smile was free place this in your cart and wait for your heart to melt over this darling little fella.
R2I6KGQGLGTLSI,"came as described  brand new, thanks"
R2SIU67YLDDFSO,"cute deer, but the seam comes apart rather easily on the back of the neck."
R340HZIZEHYLQV,these are your basic plastic building blocks.
R340HZIZEHYLQV,i believe that they would work with mega blocks but i didnt try them out with mega blocks so im not 100 sure.
R340HZIZEHYLQV,unlike mega blocks the pictures are not part of the block.
R340HZIZEHYLQV,they are stickers that you have to put on yourself.
R340HZIZEHYLQV,most children will pull the stickers off and they are not the kind meant to be taken on and off.
R340HZIZEHYLQV,"once the stickers are gone, they are just regular old blocks, not paw patrol blocks."
R340HZIZEHYLQV,i would not buy these myself because of that aspect.
R2EJOWQX2INX65,funny!
R1EMMSCZAMR5GL,"i liked this product, it is awesome the car is dicast medal and i have it in my truck."
R1EMMSCZAMR5GL,i always loved this model.
R1EMMSCZAMR5GL,i also like the show too.
RE0WX7Q8RLNWX,my grandkids love them and it is great to introduce them early to recognizing their letters.....
R179QNUWTHCS3W,model came very quickly excellent!
R1Q11V5SCEAGIZ,cant stop modifying this beauty
R2SSQP7VPKZWZU,this is so cuuute!!
R2SSQP7VPKZWZU,"as someone who has attended skunk festivals real live skunks, descented, peoples legal pets, i thought id bring this to work to playfully show to my coworkers, one of whom recently wrote up my bio in the office paper  which included my skunk festival attendances."
R2SSQP7VPKZWZU,"well everyone loved it but it scared the  out of one person we almost had to get the smelling salts, after apologizing profusely, i realized this skunkie was much more realistic than i expected."
R2SSQP7VPKZWZU,"i was able to get my hand into it and wiggle its paws, move its mouth ad turn its head  and there is a hole under the tail for one finger to move the tail around, but thats a bit awkward.only problem i had was the interior finish some of the seams are scratchy  i had to get my little swiss army knife scissors and veery caarefully trim some of the hard edges.no, i do not own a skunk as a pet i dont live in a skunks legal state."
R2SSQP7VPKZWZU,therefore i have skunk envy.
R2SSQP7VPKZWZU,this little rapscallion fills the need.
R2O7YXR4RTG6PJ,love this game!!!
R2O7YXR4RTG6PJ,!
R12IC70OW31VUF,"this is an ""off brand"" and therefore does not fit properly with lego brand legos."
R3LUUD9XFA4Y7Q,very pleased
R1QY1UQSJQPYBA,my kids love these.
R1QY1UQSJQPYBA,"i bought them for my youngests 3 birthday, but all my kids oldest is 8.5 play with them."
R2UE86C2PTWV42,my toddler loves changing minnies outfits!
RCUHFO81S72QO,"very pleased with quick delivery, good quality for price."
RCUHFO81S72QO,satisfaction maximum.
R3NXMCH1L5NBNO,exactly what i was wanting
RXAWHZ698FO75,very wellmade i would recommend.
R321OHLURROD5N,"got here after my birthday, but i kept in for remembrance."
R321OHLURROD5N,its very very nice.
RPFIQFI8YALFV,good kids love it .
R3TV2J8STR8B9L,very nice addition to our train set.
R3TV2J8STR8B9L,nice that it comes with 2 male to male pieces.
R3TV2J8STR8B9L,my daughter loves it!
RLS3NR9DCEQZU,bought these for a game night!
RLS3NR9DCEQZU,everyone loved them!
R1KHQIINRVPZJ6,easy broken and the shape of the head is not like the original chucky as the movie
R1UWDPU47DPUDK,loving it!
RVH7XRKZHBUPI,"great product, very sturdy... my 2 yr old so broke his last two toy boxes.... this one is holding up perfectly... money well spent..."
R21QC3EJISX0YY,the granddaughter loves it!!!
R21QC3EJISX0YY,she is 5 years old and can really get around on it !!
R21QC3EJISX0YY,!
R2DFZ3J68AF5EM,big hit !
R2DFZ3J68AF5EM,fun and no noise to scare anyone.
R2VDS6DT02IE3I,"super cute and ver y good quality, is small but not so much"
RW8J01CXL2I6T,very cute
R2T9BKQSITKL75,"pretty flimsy, but nit bad for the price i guess."
R3DCFQ2KTZ0RJS,these were adorable and a great price!
R376A65UIHCZBY,"our feedback is much the same as previous feedback by ""da""."
R376A65UIHCZBY,we should have taken that to heart.
R376A65UIHCZBY,these are not the official green pads as pictured.
R376A65UIHCZBY,the annoying fingerprint background covers the whole sheet of the pads unlike the official pads and seriously obscures the checkbox areas.
R376A65UIHCZBY,it is flat out false advertising to picture the original official pads and then ship these poorly designed knockoffs.
R376A65UIHCZBY,they are not worth the price paid and we can create and print a better knockoff ourselves.
R2P0DNON1GVLEF,"worthless product, poor quality, waste of money."
R32327ZDYJYFB2,i have yet to be disappointed
R1GKHZW1ERG16Q,it was perfect !!
R1GKHZW1ERG16Q,!
RMROG03IMTTW8,broke within first hour.
RMROG03IMTTW8,kid had lived it though.
R1H47SJ5LZCI7G,got the hat surprising fast and love it..was a little big but after a wash or two it fits like a glove.
RAXCXGSDK12G2,i already have leaders and cities.
RAXCXGSDK12G2,this includes extra boards and really cant think of a reason not to.
R2PRQJA71GZ1E0,exactly what i needed and fit the chair legs perfectly
R1ELNIX12JR61S,"my grandson loved it..it felt a little too synthetic for my liking, but the image was fantastic"
R2FIEE6Z58VYKZ,cheap fun projects to do with the kids.
R1ERGELQX6ZZH5,five stars
R2KFUA5AEBGF6K,"green toys are a great, they are eco friendly and designed to be recycled, which is good and all, but we really enjoy the simple basic items."
R2KFUA5AEBGF6K,"they are quite durable, and our kids really seem to like them."
R2KFUA5AEBGF6K,"this one is a bit smaller than what i expected, being only about 6"" long, but its a great size for little kids and for a small sandbox."
R2KFUA5AEBGF6K,"driver comes out easily, and the mixer itself spins."
R2KFUA5AEBGF6K,there is also a dump truck and scooper to round out the complete set.
R3O7VASTY7Z5FJ,very happy with this item.
R28ZS3RIVQAX19,perfect for my preschool class
RUP5QUCM6798J,this has been the most fun and memorable holiday tradition i have ever done as a mom.
RUP5QUCM6798J,i hope my kids pass it on to their kids.great idea and so fun for the while family.
RUP5QUCM6798J,"even once the kids stop believing, i imagine it could still be so much fun."
RUP5QUCM6798J,best part of our holiday season for sure!!
RUP5QUCM6798J,!
R2Y9QNGN2OJF7F,this is a great pool toy but unfortunately i was fooled by the picture into thinking it was bigger then it really is.its smaller then a tennis ball but bigger then a golf ball.
RKU6ZFVVDSLDH,"8292015 be supposed that arrived in 3 weeks more, but arrived today yuuupiii and im very surprised by the quality of the product is very nice, recommend !!!"
RKU6ZFVVDSLDH,!
R3GP28QYSNIQQG,kiddo loved this barbie.
R3C3DZKPP8VE1Y,they are cute but they arrived after my wedding date so i wasnt able to use them.
R3C3DZKPP8VE1Y,i will use them if r another event.
R2TJTLZL32Q42W,"sending to missionaries to mexico, they are delighted to have them to hand out at christmas."
R2ENL4TI7KC0HJ,there was not maching between the size and the description
RD02SUZS4U397,"high quality, looks great, and the perfect way to visually gauge what work has been done, and what areas need work."
RD02SUZS4U397,"a great gift idea for mother, child, parent, grandfather, or anyone that has caught the genealogy bug or needs to catch the genealogy bug."
R2YDSWW5Z7A6E,"overall, the playhouse is great."
R2YDSWW5Z7A6E,the only thing wrong were the instructions.
R2YDSWW5Z7A6E,every piece was labeled incorrectly and the screws werent labeled at all and came in one big package.
R2YDSWW5Z7A6E,we had to separate them all before beginning.
R2YDSWW5Z7A6E,the cover for the sand worked great.
R1MSMBOFZ8B34S,simple toy that baby loves.
R1MSMBOFZ8B34S,easy for him to hold and look at at 12 weeks.
R3JBD8QCAGF7KG,my little daughter loves them.
R3JBD8QCAGF7KG,its the perfect size for her doll house.
RFC63W2A2OI1C,i bought this for my 3 12 yr old grandson.
RFC63W2A2OI1C,he loves it!
RWIY4ZQ8UGDT9,great addition
R36QDRM4L8W5D1,my 6 month old loved figuring it out.. awesome motor skills
RRYOIUGQHLU8N,they are fun but lay crooked on my face.
RRYOIUGQHLU8N,they are thicker plastic so hopefully wont break but still cheap.
RRYOIUGQHLU8N,im happy with them for a poker night to wear for a little while to be funny.
R3Q2H3GC41RUBS,"videoid88d579c8a238c14f5bb8c50b1eb35e32what a cute little car, this is quite the little car.this is something any child would be thrilled to have .this is a very well made little car, it is made of high quality materials .this isnt a cheaply made car, unlike similar products on the market .i got this for my granddaughter , she positively loved it .it works amazing , just add the batteries , then off you go thats it .it runs great everything works properly , the lights and the changing into a tank and the car itself .this car drives around and when it comes upon an obstacle it turns a drives away .it drives around and changes into a tank all by itself , my granddaughter went crazy when she saw it do this .it was positively priceless , and i must say daddy and grandpa were having just as much fun.we have tried other products like this and they dont compare to the quality and price of this one.this is a really fun toy for any child or even your big child , my husband thought it was awesome .if you are looking for something like this for yourself or as a gift , you have found it with this product .i highly recommend this great little tank car,i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
R76BWCNFCYDSJ,"the game is fun, fast and easy to learn."
R76BWCNFCYDSJ,"it says it is for ages 8, but my 5 year old did not have any trouble learning how to play."
R76BWCNFCYDSJ,"the players are supposed to have the same set of tiles in the game, but our set had two different sets, which made one player at clear disadvantage."
R76BWCNFCYDSJ,"this was an ok with us, as we would offer the easier color to the little one to help him a little."
R76BWCNFCYDSJ,"the box is oversized for the game, and you can actually fit the game with the orange tokens up and still be able to close the lid  good for taking a break, but not very necessary since the game play is very short."
R16WPY1CY85OSX,"a little thin, but actually hold up pretty well."
R16WPY1CY85OSX,basically exactly what i expected.
R16WPY1CY85OSX,"i wasnt wowed, but they did the trick."
RYW90DF6Y6IVL,"love these clips, more for estheic than ammo capacity."
RYW90DF6Y6IVL,they fit and work very well!
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,i like this doll a lot.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,"shes a lot like the inner monsters a line i really went crazy over and the idea of a 28"" inner monster was just too tempting for me."
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,i had to spring for her.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,"she was a bit expensive but then again shes 28"" tall and thats a lot of plastic."
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,i think shes very pretty but she has a couple of fatal flaws that im not happy about given her hefty price.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,there is no articulation on her knees.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,the joints there are fake and given that price tag she should have real knee joints.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,this is ridiculous.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,she does have arm and wrist articulation though.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,her shoes do not come off without considerable force because there are dots of glue holding them and her feet dont even look like proper feet which is going to making giving any other shoes very difficult.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,"if you dont mind one dress, one pair of shoes, thats okay, but i was really hoping to find other stuff in my collection that might fit her feet and i dont think thats going to work well."
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,she doesnt seem to have a theme per se.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,shes got a bunch of accessories that look like they could belong to several different kinds of monster.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,"shes got were ears, but flippers, gargoyle wings and vines like venus."
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,its like shes several different characters in one doll.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,its a little weird.
R2NQIYUOG3UFGT,"if it had not been for the nonarticulated knees id have probably lived with the rest but the knee thing, it really sucks..."
R1T3XI9UU8XYW9,really high quality.the mane is something you have to feel haha!!
R1T3XI9UU8XYW9,got it for a friend for her birthday and she loves it.
R1T3XI9UU8XYW9,the people who shipped it to me were also very nice.
RKC0AN0XP5YB6,arrived on time!!!
RKC0AN0XP5YB6,great product kids will love them will buy from again!
R1T8EGO0G9C0PT,it is too easy for my son to play!
R2Z01XSYVH9CRO,love it.
R2Z01XSYVH9CRO,i got this to use in a presentation.
R2Z01XSYVH9CRO,"it fits perfectly and, it makes everyone laugh."
R3MI3KDRX0OY2J,"this lil kunai is the best thing to screw around with, my only concern is the fabric wrapped around the handle."
RMCQEQ7EJWQ8S,"so...i didnt really notice when i ordered, but lambs dont have horns."
RMCQEQ7EJWQ8S,it really should be a goat costume.
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,"one of the things i really liked about this playset is that you can separate it into two locations, or keep it together."
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,"if your kids just want to play with one part of it, they can!"
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,"assembly only takes a couple of minutes, and the car is ready to go right out of the box."
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,"everything is colorful, theres a lot to do, you get a couple of cute figures, and everything that moves doesnt require batteries or constant cranking in order to operate."
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,"you have escalators, a slide, a merrygoround, and a bunch of shoppingrelated things to play with.the main drawbacks to the set are that a lot of things here just dont work like they should."
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,"some pieces are too big or small for where they go, and a couple of the parts are on the flimsy side."
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,the slide and escalator in particular.
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,they work...just not very well.
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,"because things arent balanced, a lot of times, the figures will fall out of place when something is moving."
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,it can get very frustrating for kids fast.
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,"if this were a cheaper playset, it wouldnt be such a downer, but youre paying half a benjamin on this thing."
R3F5SFIP05ADZQ,theres no real way to fix any of this either.
R3ND11VTG81A03,great figure really liked it.
R2HE4X51A9W0ML,two year old grand daughter likes this present.
R2HE4X51A9W0ML,she really likes the jumprope feature!
R2PA9VZQOFITUD,she has had a lot of fun with this!
R3AWKGAKYW9OGZ,i love it!
R31IAQXN68ER9B,this was bad.
R31IAQXN68ER9B,you put water in it.
R31IAQXN68ER9B,and it buckled in the middle on one side.
R25CT2KC34QAMU,bought this as a christmas gift for my four year old grand daughter.
R25CT2KC34QAMU,she loves it.
R25CT2KC34QAMU,it looks nice and plays easily.
R25CT2KC34QAMU,one leg was a little unstable but we were able to add a bit of wood glue which solved the problem.
R1KSKF1Z85T3D4,"great price , fast delivery , cant wait to buy another!"
R36TIEUTBEWADJ,crown didnt fit my daughters head.
R36TIEUTBEWADJ,had a hard time staying on so she lost interest.
R3JZWHXDY380NY,defective product.
R3JZWHXDY380NY,i bought chloe as a tenth birthday gift.
R3JZWHXDY380NY,she was all my granddaughter talked about.
R3JZWHXDY380NY,she was shipped and arrived on time.
R3JZWHXDY380NY,"she is very cute, not quite as cute as the picture, but nice."
R3JZWHXDY380NY,"hair not great, for the price i expected better."
R3JZWHXDY380NY,"my granddaughter loved her until we put the batteries in and her head did not move, now she is very disappointed."
R3JZWHXDY380NY,"she has to go home without her gift, so that it can be returned."
R2VI9ZWKJESU9I,excellent product
R2C63RKX0C7HN,i love this game and play it nonstop.
R2C63RKX0C7HN,it is so entertaining and you just really enjoy yourself.
R2C63RKX0C7HN,"playing with two is fun, but the bigger the group the more fun and the longer."
R1391TT7JUH89C,"while the finished product is spectacular, mega bloks has a long way to go in order to make them a serious contender in the buildingblock industry."
R1391TT7JUH89C,"the pieces do not connect as readily, easily, and freely as lego pieces, and the packaging is the worst part."
R1391TT7JUH89C,"while the sets arrive in several separate sealed plastic bags, they are not numbered like lego and seem to have no rhyme or reason of separation."
R1391TT7JUH89C,"because of this packages, the instructions cannot direct a child to numbered bags for specific parts needed throughout the process of building."
RQ3KWUCEZEV0D,real nice but a little overpriced
R3HCS8GRBNNVF7,im a big twd fan.

R3HCS8GRBNNVF7,i love merle!
R3VQA71X5GTK91,the peas came in a cheap yellow color
R1QQ8J2A20FGMB,so ill preface this review by saying my young child loves this.
R1QQ8J2A20FGMB,as a parent it drives me crazy for two main reasons1 the sound doesnt stop when the baby stops playing with it!
R1QQ8J2A20FGMB,"it shuts off eventually, but baby can stop pressing the buttons and it still makes noise for a bit.2 id admit this is petty, but it drives me nuts that the song this cube sings has the words &34theres fun on five sides... the cube is fun for everyone!&34 the cube has six sides, not five!"
R1QQ8J2A20FGMB,"and yes, i understand that one side is pretty boring and thats why the song says that, but for the love of every math geek in the country, please change the song so my kid doesnt grow up thinking a cube has five sides!"
R1QQ8J2A20FGMB,"like i said, i know its petty, but by the 400th time it really gets on your nerves..."
R3SY6VZ8MBXMUB,super soft!
R3SY6VZ8MBXMUB,and such a great gift

R3PNU3X7MBPJ38,"smell bad,but after two weeks,its become ok"
R2J0RN51OU5C7M,the die cast metal is way better than the plastic ones
R3LOBC6BKGXC0Q,the canopy part has never been able to stay up for me we have had it for about 3 months now.
R3LOBC6BKGXC0Q,other than that it works great.
R1GGUWMMU9MKN9,product is great except mine was missing a magnet.
R1GGUWMMU9MKN9,"it was original packaging, but the chipmunks magnet was not included."
R1GGUWMMU9MKN9,i only received 19 magnets.
R1GGUWMMU9MKN9,i would have returned but needed the items for party favors.
R380I52W2N6ZSX,you need after run oil if you care for your machine
R37KVQWAUEF23H,"love this inchworm,it is cute but small"
R1YNXWDMDW5S5X,sent this to my grandsons and two years later they are still using this game.
R1YNXWDMDW5S5X,"they are six and nine, both now have joined the school chess club."
R1YNXWDMDW5S5X,i highly recommend this set.
R2ODQPR1N1WRLD,awesome she looks beautiful.
R2ODQPR1N1WRLD,like on the picture.
R2ODQPR1N1WRLD,mizore is life .
R66XTEWO1ID5V,exploding kittens older sibling.
R66XTEWO1ID5V,"if you already bought the original edition, i recommend that you buy this with it if you are a responsible and mature maybe adult."
R66XTEWO1ID5V,"as the title suggests, the art is very questionable for the workplace so definitely dont play this with kids."
R66XTEWO1ID5V,i used this in addition to my regular deck as a special surprise for a party i went to.
R66XTEWO1ID5V,"i think everyone appreciated the art.above all else, gameplay is amazing."
R66XTEWO1ID5V,paranoia and sabotage and hilarity.
R66XTEWO1ID5V,you cant beat a card game that fulfills all three.
R2LY0EGMBE9TCB,good
RO73HTDAWBKIG,havent played it yet.
RO73HTDAWBKIG,extensive rules.
RO73HTDAWBKIG,beautiful pictures.
R28Q6SZKTX16FN,just what i wanted for my water deck
R2QHSH1VZ95JOY,it was really small.
R2QHSH1VZ95JOY,the measured size includes the tube around the cooler compartment.
R2QHSH1VZ95JOY,it would be difficult to fit a 12 pack with ice in there.
RAKMRFK04ZUD0,love this
R3TDC7P5ALA912,seems like some balloons were hit or miss for completely filling the water balloon.
R3TDC7P5ALA912,be sure to follow the instructions.
R3TDC7P5ALA912,"tub already with water, hold deflated balloons into to water, turn water on full power."
R3TDC7P5ALA912,we definitely had more hits than undefiled balloons.
R3TDC7P5ALA912,just did not like seeing some of them wasted.
R3TDC7P5ALA912,but far better than spending hours trying to fill the same amount of balloons the traditional way.
R1OKFA9ZI0IS77,magformers are fantastic toys for boys and girls.
R1OKFA9ZI0IS77,"my 4 year old granddaughter has enjoyed playing with them for a year already and they remain one of her favorite toys  a couple of days ago she made a playground, complete with ferris wheel.marketing this one tiny set in pastel colors to girls really distresses me."
R1OKFA9ZI0IS77,its made worse by the fact that this seem to be the only set in these colors.
R1OKFA9ZI0IS77,its a pale imitation of what the bigger sets provide.
R1OKFA9ZI0IS77,do yourself a favor and buy a bigger set in regular colors so the building options are much greater.
R1OKFA9ZI0IS77,the ones in the $40 range have enough pieces to really exercise the imagination.
R1OKFA9ZI0IS77,"your girls and boys will get much from it.one of the advantages of magformers for moms and dads is that because the pieces are magnetic they store compactly and there are no little pieces underfoot, as there are with other building sets."
R1D0FTYUHR1AGH,"awesome trike, my son loves his &34bike&34 and can go pretty fast on this thing!!"
R1D0FTYUHR1AGH,he was 3 when we got it for him so he was never really interested in the rocking part of it but we have had it now over a year and he still loves it!!
R1D0FTYUHR1AGH,i kept on the handle in the upright position for extra control for mama if we arent listening.. and for the extra visibility it has at a higher lever so grabs more attention for myself and otherscars to be able to see him and or his bike.
R1D0FTYUHR1AGH,"sometimes if he had been on pavement going fast for a while the back peg holding on the extra handle can come out, it tips backwards so it doesnt hurt little guy as long as you dont loose the peg.we got the yellow and blue which was significantly cheaper at the time not sure why but happy with it!!"
R1D0FTYUHR1AGH,100 recommend
RYKHU3NNJOX3C,"fun, fun, fun."
R3NGVO17F9Y2A8,the product itself is great.
R3NGVO17F9Y2A8,but there is a minor defect paint problem.
R3NGVO17F9Y2A8,its too small so i dont replacereturn it.
R3NGVO17F9Y2A8,otherwise i would give 5 star.
R2CL5YV6ZI64JM,"easy to learn, fun to play."
RVT8LVORB9HD1,was a gift for a friends daughter....she loved it.
R3DQGUDQ7T1V3J,alot bigger than i thought.
R3DQGUDQ7T1V3J,will not fit in barbie house.
R2M56RAI6O9X22,it has a great likeness of dr. strange and the silver surfer
R1PEGLOXOAA0HB,not too bad...
R2QOY1C1561NYZ,good for kids party.
RU6JBCR0VVNHS,deliver in time !
RU6JBCR0VVNHS,as promissed product
R4PLC4T9YN8BB,jist got the card in the mail.
R4PLC4T9YN8BB,they mailed it in this hard plastic sleeve & in it a flimsy plastic sleeve.
R4PLC4T9YN8BB,"all that for a $1 card, simply worth it!"
R23BWMZNBIGSEC,as expected
RYKT5GF0D85RN,its even better than i expected!
RYKT5GF0D85RN,everyone is getting a kick out of it.
R1HLU3SL4AH6YC,a little smaller than expected
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,"my adult son spent his entire childhood playing with toys like this, from legos and lincoln logs to erector sets and, finally, his favorite  complex roller coasters."
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,"now, hes a structural engineer who designs skyscrapers  but how does he like to relax when he comes home?"
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,building these things.
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,"oh, ostensibly, he builds them with his fiveyearold son, but hes been doing this since the boy was an infant."
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,"my grandson appears to be a chip off his father, but at five, hes far too young to assemble this toy on his own, even though it says &34six and up.&34 normally he is a couple years ahead of the curve on any building toy.building this marble maze was a lot of fun  for my son."
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,"he had it together in less than an hour, but it was fairly painstaking."
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,"things have to line up perfectly, the black connectors must be turned the same way, etc."
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,my grandson helped a little but kept getting bored.
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,"just like me.once the set was complete, adult and the child both had a great time."
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,only three marbles come with the set  they added more immediately.
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,it reminds me of a rube goldberg contraption  its very amusing.
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,sometimes the marbles jump the track and the gears can be a little clunky if you stop turning them at the wrong moment.this maze is probably best for very patient kids above the age of eight or ten who really enjoy building.
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,a twelveyearold would love it  as do adult kids.
R3GY69HAJ3AG0P,id give it four stars for my son and three for my grandson because he does love playing with it now that its built.
RK3ZWC1MVBUE4,love it!!!!!!
RK3ZWC1MVBUE4,perfect in every way!
RHGXSYSGQIH6U,well made... love him!

RUQX8KV65LYO4,amazing product at a great price!
RTWJQ0M0FN9NE,my daughter loves her back pack
R30V2X66QO5X6P,absolutely a nightmare!
R30V2X66QO5X6P,"stickers, glue, and color came off onto our hands."
R30V2X66QO5X6P,we used my mothers tiles once and will never be able to use them again.
R30V2X66QO5X6P,the stickers cannot be removed.
R30V2X66QO5X6P,horrible experience.
R30V2X66QO5X6P,they returned my purchase price but refused even to remove shipping costs on a new set of tiles which i needed.
R30V2X66QO5X6P,i cant emphasize enough how awful a transaction this was!
R30V2X66QO5X6P,stay away from yellow mountain!
R2WGLWRRODYYX9,a big pack of hello kitty party favors.
R2WGLWRRODYYX9,perfect if youre looking for a big pack of hello kitty party favors.
R15V0LRQDVS0RB,fairly easy kit to build.
R15V0LRQDVS0RB,it does require some panel lining and paint to replicate the products pic.
R15V0LRQDVS0RB,its quite heavy without a action base so posing is tough without it.
R15V0LRQDVS0RB,even without paint and panel lining its super good looking and well worth the time and money.
R1BK32E1N3KM8T,surprise gift for girlfriend.
R1BK32E1N3KM8T,huge outthegate excitement.
R1BK32E1N3KM8T,romantic gestures always need a bit of a punch at boxopening for sure.
RJE5W3SJ2VG2Y,i love my syma and we have had a lot of fun with it.
RJE5W3SJ2VG2Y,ive gotten it stuck in 2 different trees at approximately 30 in the air which has led to some interesting actions to retrieve it.
RJE5W3SJ2VG2Y,"my last syma landed in a pool, so this is my 2nd one."
RJE5W3SJ2VG2Y,"lesson learned, either keep it at a low altitude or use it in a huge field."
RJE5W3SJ2VG2Y,buy more batteries because this one only lasts 810mins each.
RJE5W3SJ2VG2Y,i gave it 4 stars as the first 2 transmitters didnt work correctly.
RJE5W3SJ2VG2Y,"luckily, 3rd transmitter was a charm."
R3EZA6OQYUNG45,hes perfect!
R3QWIF5EAHY6M1,very sensitive as far as the microphone goes.
R3QWIF5EAHY6M1,"cool that i can plug in my phone and my daughter can sing a long that way too, but the microphone seems pretty cheaply made"
R1IH2M47D504PW,belle objet de collection!
R2RE5KE6D85TKA,"great product, great service."
RIQVTVDOM4NDZ,"really cute figure of pre haircut yura, i have no issues with it in terms of quality, but the face can be kinda derpy."
RIQVTVDOM4NDZ,could be me since i havent watched the anime since it aired.
REPZM0FON9WSY,arrived on time and as expected.
R2KBST1TMD7FGX,my son is a huge fan of minecraft...this has been on his wish list for some time!
R2KBST1TMD7FGX,"hes thrilled with it and loves that it makes real ""creeper sounds""."
R2KBST1TMD7FGX,"i liked that it came wrapped in plastic protective packaging, as all the ones ive seen in stores look like theyve been used over and over, dirty, worn out, etc."
R22ATR1GI87C7B,adorable!
R2ENJP93D38SBN,what youre getting is the equivalent of those basicsabers that come in the anakinvaderobiwan variety there used to be a quigon hilt which hasnt been available in a decade.
R2ENJP93D38SBN,"im sure that kids will generally get over the fact that the blades cannot be spun, though a rotarylocking mechanism wouldnt be too hard to implement despite making the circular hilt thicker, and that the blades themselves are 13 shorter than the usual basicsaber, but the $30 price for something this crude is indicative of hasbro expanding their profit margin at the expense of the parents of potentially disappointed children."
R2ENJP93D38SBN,"try to find it cheaper, if possible."
R2CBSR9LN06PDC,adorable monkey.
R2CBSR9LN06PDC,i enjoy playing with it more than my little one does.
R1AAWWEG9WDOZS,fun gift for family game night

RXXQPMSA9MFOS,it is ok
R2HAWY0HQGO3NC,great gift!
R1OJ09B8HWLV08,difficult to detach but awesome concept and way better than having to constantly refill.
RZA47CLALSYY7,there are 34 individual rows of sticky backed gem stickers that instantly turn the ordinary into the extraordinary!each strip is a length of gems with sticky backs that can be arranged in any order or pattern that you like.
RZA47CLALSYY7,its easier than making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
RZA47CLALSYY7,just peel and stick the stickcons to any pair of shoes.
RZA47CLALSYY7,so easy!
RZA47CLALSYY7,the hardest part is choosing which pair of shoes to use!the 7 year old was so excited and absolutely could not wait to bedazzled her shoes!
RZA47CLALSYY7,"she carefully plotted where shes going to put everything.start to finish, she was able to decorate both of her shoes in 10 minutes."
RZA47CLALSYY7,and look at the results!these are so pretty!
RZA47CLALSYY7,they have great staying power too.these are also perfect for giving life to a older pair of shoes!
RZA47CLALSYY7,i have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.
RZA47CLALSYY7,the opinions are 100 mine
R39GTVK4YGXPW4,wrong material.
R39GTVK4YGXPW4,i expected to get trim with an inside measure of 14 inch.

R17KXRB9Q5PW8H,i got this because my 2.5 yr old loves loves loves pinky pie.
R17KXRB9Q5PW8H,it an okay toy.
R17KXRB9Q5PW8H,its awkward for her though.
R17KXRB9Q5PW8H,have to push put the legs in order to spin the wheel u der the bell to twirl the balloons.
R1OGS5UEO7WG1R,awesome figures
R2F0F5U0991KOI,i was so excited to get this today only to find that the clear plastic was broken on the box so theres dust all over the inside also there are chips in the paint on the head and im not sure if it should be green but from the description it doesnt flow in the dark.
R2F0F5U0991KOI,so why isnt it white?

R1WB6NY2QFQNWK,and have fun.
R1PEHZX5LLVQ24,"cute, fun toy"
R29D7ICUBEMYO7,not all of them blew up to full size.
R29D7ICUBEMYO7,i tried to blow them up ahead of time so they would be ready and half of them lost their water.
R29D7ICUBEMYO7,great concept but i had to buy twice as many in order to have enough

R11OAL2YYF36OU,i bought the governor last year and he was a hit.
R11OAL2YYF36OU,if you get one here and there you can fill the stockings with the walking dead  glenn is loved by most fans so get him in your cart before he is gone or his price rises.
R11OAL2YYF36OU,you cannot go wrong when collecting and glenn is a great place to start.
R11OAL2YYF36OU,"he is very detailed and if you are a comic book fan you do know his days are numbered so grab him now before his demise, if you wait until then the price will be so much more."
R11OAL2YYF36OU,"bottom line  if you are thinking about collecting twd figures, start here.great quality, shipped fast and fantastic price."
RKSV4NXWMKYUU,the 124 astonmartin dp 214 by model factory hiro is exactly what you would when bringing two of the worlds premier marquees together  unquestionable excellence.make no mistake this is not a toy that can be slapped together in an afternoon or two.
RKSV4NXWMKYUU,"it becomes, when given time and talent, a family heirloom  one that will proudly passed to future generations."
RKSV4NXWMKYUU,"building experience, aptitude, dry fits, good painting techniques, etc, will all come into play during the building kit."
RKSV4NXWMKYUU,"it is robust and will not deteriorate and be spirited away into a rarely used closet, but hold a place of dignity and pride within a decor.unlike the age group suggested by mfh, i would personally suggest an age of 18 to 20 years before taking on such an undertaking.with best regards, wolf"

R19Q2JL1IFGSFU,we love this necklace.
R19Q2JL1IFGSFU,i decided to super glue the lid on before presenting it to my daughter.
R19Q2JL1IFGSFU,but that was just a personal choice of mine.
R19Q2JL1IFGSFU,she wore it for about one month straight and it still held up.
R19Q2JL1IFGSFU,"the hoop holding onto the chain did bend when she got it caught on something, but that was pretty easy to fix."
R1NULRETSIOFUG,save your money.
R1NULRETSIOFUG,this thing is flimsy and so gentile.
R1NULRETSIOFUG,broke just taking it out of box.

R30PQRVFIBFNEL,its great to have a wide variety with these brushes.
R30PQRVFIBFNEL,they work very well!
R2R2Q65O1ETADH,buying this online was much cheaper than in stores.
R2R2Q65O1ETADH,its exactly what my son wanted for his birthday.
R2R2Q65O1ETADH,easy to put together and play and doesnt take up a lot of room.
R30AGZW1IBXUX9,perfect for what we needed.
R30AGZW1IBXUX9,it supports different weight.

R1Y4T1WQ84SQ9W,"my 21months, soon to be 22 months old son absolutely loves this elmo doll!"
R1Y4T1WQ84SQ9W,"i bought it for him with my birthday money and he loves listening to the number getting ready for school song, elmo singing his a, b,cs, and speaking up whenever my son zips and unzips his yellow triangular zipper, opens and closes his purple square snap."
R1Y4T1WQ84SQ9W,"he still hasnt figured out open elmos red velcro strap on left shoe, but hell eventually figure it out, but he knows how to unvelcro both of his own shoes, silly boy!"
R1Y4T1WQ84SQ9W,1010 a highly educational toy!
R1Y4T1WQ84SQ9W,i wish there was a more updated version of this doll where elmo is wearing real fake leather shoes that stay attached to his feet with real shoelaces!
R1Y4T1WQ84SQ9W,"then, i can teach my son how to tie his shoelaces!"
R1UWUAO2ZAP9AV,easy for baby to hold
R12A2Q2EJ29O93,i am thrilled with the mahjongg set.
R12A2Q2EJ29O93,so much lighter and easier to carry than the leather or metal cases.
R12A2Q2EJ29O93,"like the new pushers, too."
R12A2Q2EJ29O93,"dice are tiny, but thats an easy fix."
R2M77JCL513XQD,i wasnt happy to find out these are now made in china.
R2M77JCL513XQD,"however, the toy design is still superior to anything else available."
R2M77JCL513XQD,"i work with children in a therapeutic setting, and they love to measure pinto beans with the discovery cups that belong to the facility."
R2M77JCL513XQD,"im getting a set of my own cups with about 6 pounds of pinto beans, some scoops, a large funnel, magnifiying glass and putting it all in a rectangular clear plasic tote."
R2M77JCL513XQD,"instant, inexpensive, mesmerizing, soothing, and even pregeometry activities available!"
R14YAM0U85ZAEZ,wonderful for a oneyear old.
R14YAM0U85ZAEZ,good quality.
R6QYFPE2IFOTF,this is really awesome work.
R6QYFPE2IFOTF,ill definitely be buying another soon.
R30R6XHBV4N7GR,large size and very buoyant.
R30R6XHBV4N7GR,much better than the less expensive and smaller options
R1632M4I4RPLRW,not comfortable at all!
RQJCZF78EV9KK,"pretty, high quallity puzzle."
R3BBECCS7FUHCY,seems to be good stuff.
R3BBECCS7FUHCY,i think some people might mistake it for being aluminum instead of copper because it consists of pre tinned copper wires.
R3BBECCS7FUHCY,if you snip a piece off you can see the copper color in the middle.
R3BBECCS7FUHCY,nice thick insulation as well.
RLWI8H17I9BNH,not the real thing
R3GYM4TUOHFAEX,came with batteries and an immediate hit with a a 2 yr old!
R3GYM4TUOHFAEX,great first personal computer.
R21YMRTJH86P01,looks good but the arm and leg often fall off and we have to reattach.
R387FLPI8TXE2S,"this is a fantastic way to get children to make up their own short stories, silly or serious."
RB6HCNK63UTER,"a great prop, well made, the shoes are sparkly and realistic."
R1R4Q9HYGZ11YJ,"i got this dice bag on thursday, and took it to my table top game on sat."
R1R4Q9HYGZ11YJ,all of my friends really liked the design and i think they are going to get one of their own.
R1R4Q9HYGZ11YJ,its a really cool idea that actually works!
R169WYH0DFQW1P,last forever
R2TVEST032RE6C,great little play set.
R2TVEST032RE6C,the set has scenes that can be switched out.
R2TVEST032RE6C,"there are lots of accessories, but rarity is the only pony that is included."
R2TVEST032RE6C,"while there are many pieces, they are all contained in the set when it folds up."
R1GIZM45FMM2WQ,"work as advertised, buy with confidence."
R1KSL62YMGMR3Y,the peppa pig balloon is actually pretty big
R3R9IKWS5B9NSL,just as advertised.
R2IESRZAZHS168,"bought three pirate ships, and this, the least expensive, gets the most play, primarily because of the cannon."
R2IESRZAZHS168,"it can be removed, easily loaded, and the darts shoot well without hitting hard."
RKMOKP3BUXKAD,nice little danbo.
RKMOKP3BUXKAD,as advertised.
RQY2AJXJUQ346,awesome figure great articulation
R3FSBC6UHSOLPQ,difficult to transform but looks great on my shelves amongst the other auto & decep bots
R1I8ZMZ4QM5A62,".the deep sea submarine in this set is a beautiful piece, which would look good on any shelf."
R1I8ZMZ4QM5A62,"the build, itselfwent quickly, and all parts were bagged by step, directions, for the build were clear and everything came together nicely."
R1I8ZMZ4QM5A62,"my one main criticism as usual is about the stickers, they are difficult to apply for a nice finish."
R1I8ZMZ4QM5A62,"the assembled sunken treasure chestbone cage display are ok in the set, their adequate, but its just kind of generic, especially when compared to the sub itself."
R1I8ZMZ4QM5A62,now the addition of two divers and a shark was nice touch and affords some room for play time scenarios.
R1I8ZMZ4QM5A62,"the submersible, though, is the jewel of the set and everything about the sub looks marvellous."
R1I8ZMZ4QM5A62,"everything looks good in this set as whole, and if you can afford to marry up either the smaller sets in the theme, or one of the larger then you have a great set piece and lastly this beauty, meaning the sub, can float and it floats real well!."
R1W3KXM9X9AVYO,this is a fun toy that every kid should get a chance to play with!
R1W3KXM9X9AVYO,the cart itself is sturdy enough and the plastic pieces are good for smaller hands.
R1W3KXM9X9AVYO,the only thing i wish could be different are the cardboard items.
R1W3KXM9X9AVYO,those wont last long with little hands on them.
R1W3KXM9X9AVYO,"my grandkids are gonna have such a good time playing ""grocery store"" with this!"

R2QWXXGBAV2V94,we used this hat for our company meeting to sort folks into teams for a fun challenge and it fit ok on adult heads.
R2QWXXGBAV2V94,for the price i dont feel bad throwing it away after if i cant find a taker.
R3OE4SKYB8L1QM,my son loves to play with this toy.
R190G3JNSNWHGK,my neighbor loaned me these feet and i absolutely love them.
R190G3JNSNWHGK,i am going to borrow them again for halloween when i dress up like a mutant chicken.
R190G3JNSNWHGK,i already have my chicken capmask so i will be great at our annual trunk or treat.
R190G3JNSNWHGK,these feet are so comfortable and do not hurt my feet at all.
R190G3JNSNWHGK,they are really cozy and nice.
R190G3JNSNWHGK,i cant wait.

R3BABW32S3Y7NU,awesome customer service!
R3BABW32S3Y7NU,i recommend this seller and like before i love these lego.
R3BABW32S3Y7NU,i received 2 same minions.. i was expecting 3 of them all different minions so i was very disappointed.
R3BABW32S3Y7NU,the one with two eyes is my favorite.. i had to give one away to my brother.
R3BABW32S3Y7NU,"other than that, i enjoyed this."
R3BABW32S3Y7NU,tiny but fun
RYTTQAB9EKT6T,we used this for our 56 month old child.
RYTTQAB9EKT6T,"he is a tall, larger baby, so the fit was okay."
RYTTQAB9EKT6T,it will probably be a bit better in a few months or next summer.
RYTTQAB9EKT6T,"the other older kids in the pool loved this also and wanted to play with it, too."
RYTTQAB9EKT6T,i think we will definitely get good use out of it over the first 12 years of our babys life.
R2TTOZVUJ2XA53,this was a huge hit for the cars and stickerlover in our family.
R37BDDR162NOF,got this for my grandson.
R37BDDR162NOF,he just loves it!
R1R8D9ZI3QG85H,good.

R2TEQZEVT568B0,beautiful

R3SDEEPJUHGJHW,my kids love these for the bath.
R3SDEEPJUHGJHW,i love that they are easy to clean up too.
R3SDEEPJUHGJHW,will purchase again.
R2WXTF77EWIT5E,the bubbles always have leaked from elmos mouth and it takes extra effort to get them flowing.
R2WXTF77EWIT5E,my son loves elmo but i should have invested in a talking doll instead!
R16H314NZ0SBE6,a very good game.
RHHFXU5G287ND,thin very cheap plastic will shatterdo not put to much weight on itused silicon lubricant and it spins like a champ im very happy with thiseasy to transport the rubber pads really hold on to the cari put a rc still hot right onto the rubber without thinking and it didnt melt im happy with thati use the tray a lot wish they continued the tray around to the other side for more space with thin movable spacers for a great place for keeping screws separate
R14EC4N64Y9QDC,its a great little charger.
R14EC4N64Y9QDC,"i just got into quadcopters and this charger had the features i wanted, and its been performing well for me."
R14EC4N64Y9QDC,my batteries have xt60 connectors so the included connectors are charging them nicely.
R14EC4N64Y9QDC,"it charges very fast and while im sure theres fancier chargers out there, this one suits me fine."
R14EC4N64Y9QDC,"it supports every battery i need and it has a lot of options for charging output, and you can save customized charging settings for each battery you have, which is a nice feature.this charger does come with a cable that has a plug for the input to the charger on one end, and aligator clips on the other, but it does not have an ac adapter included."
R14EC4N64Y9QDC,"you could either buy an adapter and hope it includes the proper connector, plug it into a 12v battery terminal, or do what i did i found an old 12v 2a adapter for a router i dont use anymore, i cut the wires and stripped away a small lead and clipped on the included aligator clips and powered the unit like that."
R14EC4N64Y9QDC,its working great so far.
R2PH044BALLPP6,there is cheap and same stuffs inside the eggs

RA6N7NASY5MMX,this worked perfectly for my cosplay.
RA6N7NASY5MMX,i needed it to put on my body and some clothing items.
RA6N7NASY5MMX,it itched for a friend of mine but did not itch for me.
RA6N7NASY5MMX,something to think about.
RA6N7NASY5MMX,it did look very realistic!

ROJH8NBTV7283,oh the possibilities for my zombie deck.
ROJH8NBTV7283,i could easily give each zombie 500500. this card is great for themed decks that can produce a ton of tokens.
R31FJRJAFW8IKD,perfect
R2G61MHNY4D2EJ,we had two of these and the 6 and seven year olds at the birthday party enjoyed knocking over the green pigs.
R2G61MHNY4D2EJ,worked for less than 10 minutes.
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,i received this product as part of a bzzagent review.
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"my two daughters 10 and 6 were very excited to try out the chocolate maker, as they had seen this in stores earlier in the summer."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,assembly was very easy and quick.
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,only five pieces needed to be snapped into place and then we were ready to start melting chocolate.
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"the product advertises that no microwave needed, but i was very hesitant about how the melting process would work."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"according to the product instructions, simply fill the melting container with hot tap water, screw on the top, and then place chocolate chips or pieces into the bowl."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,there is a divider for keeping different color chocolates separate.
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"to be honest, after reading the directions, this was the step i was most concerned about."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"on my first attempt, i filled the container with hot tap water, placed the chocolate, and waited the instructed 2 minutes before stirring."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,it did not go well.
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"the pieces were still completely solid, and while we did manage to start breaking up the pieces with the included plastic spatula, the process took a long time."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"plus, there was little room to operate with the divider inserted."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,we abandoned the stirring process and elected to melt our chocolate in the microwave.
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"we did pour the melted chocolate back into the melting container as we began the decorating process, though."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"while the included container might not melt the chocolate at a speed satisfactory for kids, it did an excellent job of keeping the chocolate heated and workable.the decorating process was a bit tedious for the children, but they had a very good time trying to add color to the owl and chocolate square molds."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"while we wont win artistic awards, both girls were pleased with the resulting appearance."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"i had a little more luck with the chocolate pops mold, but the cupcake and swirl patterns were much smaller and tedious."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"i did lose some of the chocolate decoration on both the swirl and the cupcake mold when i popped them out of the freezer, but i may not have added enough cooking spray to the molds at the start."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"the spinner was a neat feature for the girls to operate, but both were more interested in popping their molds into the freezer than in completing the process of spinning the chocolate to ensure it is well coated and dispersed within the molds.overall, the product was fun, and im sure my daughters will get some continued use out of it, much like their easybake oven."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"we havent yet prepared chocolates to package with the included wraps and decorations, but i expect that to be a weekend project soon."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"the product is all plastic, and, while the gyroscope spinner seems well built, the two &34legs&34 dont seem to be very solid, so the spinning process may wear on them, especially with an &34enthusiastic&34 child on the handle."
R13SCRT7UU1AWZ,"clean up was very easy.pros easy assembly, cute molds.cons chocolate is not included, melting process takes a while."
R2T1TP8V9RM5AD,"what a neat little gadget  let me start off by saying im not tech savvy at all, but knew my son would absolutely love this."
R2T1TP8V9RM5AD,"i was dreading the set up, as we have a few similar toys that were nightmares to get up and running."
R2T1TP8V9RM5AD,i was surprised at how easy it was to set up and charge.
R2T1TP8V9RM5AD,"it only took a few ""test flights"" to get the hang of the controls, and i love that its multidirectional."
R2T1TP8V9RM5AD,the battery stays charged plenty long enough for a fun afternoon.
R2T1TP8V9RM5AD,"it kept all three of my kids 13, 10, and 7 fully immersed in play all afternoon which is a win for any mom."
R2T1TP8V9RM5AD,im very glad i decided to go ahead and grab this.
R2T1TP8V9RM5AD,i was offered this product at a discount in exchange for my honest thoughts on it.
RZZN6TOL98PRP,it has a special place in my collection and i love that is looks traditional
R6ZQ6XJL6T8R6,my 2 year old loves this toy!
R3FSU7QIQS5YLU,"an excellentmodel, but not for a beginner."
R6XVN9ATUL5GI,super fast shipping!

R2NLI90Y39SUF2,my son said that overall he likes the card but he wishes it was an ex.
R1T9I2OTL2NBJS,everything was as promised.
R1T9I2OTL2NBJS,thanks!
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"videoidc3022c076c09ab44153cf1e1de508fc5the dreamwalker obviously isnt for anyone, including children, those under 5 tall, and 220 pounds on up."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,perhaps i could exclude myself on the grounds that i dont have that innate finely honed balance that one should have before attempting to ride.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"some people are naturals and can skate board, snow board, ski or use a selfbalancing scooter with ease."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"this is certainly not a toy and although many find it easy to use with little challenges, others i know whove tried have taken potentially serious spills."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,take a pass if you dont have the coordination to manage the dreamwalker.ive had the dreamwalker for a couple of weeks now and people shy away from it like it had the plague.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,its a totally solid piece of machinery and ive had zero problems with the battery.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"ive been testing it on and off, when no ones looking of course, and really like it."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"i rather draw the line at the word ""love,"" but as far as the technology and the quality of this selfbalancing scooter, its topnotch."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,i wouldnt go so far as to say that learning how to ride is intuitive because its not.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"people do rave about how easy it is, but that ""easy"" comes with practice and allowing the body to relax and guide the dreamwalker.first up, getting on and subsequently off the scooter is the critical part."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,the way to mount the dreamwalkers platform is to quickly put your strongest foot up first very quickly followed by your other one.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,its rather like a quick hop.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,getting off the scooter is just the reverse.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,quickly dismount to the rear with you weakest foot first and then your strong one.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"if you have a hallway where you can move freely up and down, that would be the perfect practice field so to speak."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"seriously dont believe these people who pick it up in five minutes and are off.i had problems initially because i was not letting my body do the work, but i was trying to insist the scooter do what i wanted."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"the key, for me anyway, was to relax and not overthink the task at hand."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"you still wont see me traveling to the local store in back anytime soon, but i am quickly gaining a decent amount of control."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"not to discourage anyone, but i just want to be more realistic."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"this is great fun, but not intuitive."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"oh, and i had a rock climbing helmet on and i suggest that anyone who uses one put on the protective gear."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"the first few attempts at getting on and off the dreamwalker just could throw you on your back.the dreamwalker has a lithium ion battery, which is the ultimate in dependable."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,when i want to charge its simply an overnight deal.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"it does come fully charged, but instead of waiting with bated breath, the overnight makes like simple."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"the body of the dreamwalker appears to be an impactresistant polyurethane, but obviously not scratchresistant."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"until you get really good at working with this selfbalancing scooter, you can easily put your own bumpers on."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,im not really worried about scuffing it will happen try putting some selfadhesive weather seal on until you are good at it.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"its rather like putting training wheels on a bicycle.there are seriously no problems with the dreamwalker, but the problems are with the user."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,i need to learn to relax more instead of trying to think for the scooter.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,what is does is pick up on my subtle muscle movements.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"when i first tried it out, it seemed as if my body were resisting and the scooter decided i wanted to go backwards each time."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"as i mentioned, a hallway would be a great practice field."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,the hands can lightly guide and give some confidence.
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"i was all over the place for a while, but fortunately i didnt fall."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"the dreamwalker is the ultimate in cool, highquality, but not intuitive."
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,would i recommend it?
RG9A9XGMPWE8H,"if you are capable, yes, but it you cant walk and chew gum, take a pass.specs weight 26.45 pounds 12 kg motor power 1000w drive mode dualwheel and twoway direct drive rated speed 8kmhour balance detection 3 gyro sensors  3 accelerometers mileage 9.20 miles 15 kilometers battery capacity 110wh control system leray smart walker rated load 220 pounds 90kg battery capacity 110whwhats in the box1."

R9WA6ZXC7MDB8,so cute and sweet
R1YHCL0BKSGR86,my grandchildren love playing with this
R1AZ44WN51OTZ,"the light is an incadescent bulb in the rectangular base of the switch, the toggle handle is not illuminated."
R1AZ44WN51OTZ,"as others mentioned, when mounted, the light will be invisible unless the installation will accomodate an opening in the backing material so the bulb can remain visible.regarding the switch resistance, it is close to 0 ohms between power  and acc, that is what needs to be hooked up for switching."
R1AZ44WN51OTZ,"people measuring 25 ohm are doing so between power  and ground , which is the resistance of the lamp filament."
R1AZ44WN51OTZ,"if you want the light to work, connect your circuit  to power , your circuit ground to ground, and your switched lead to acc."
R1AZ44WN51OTZ,"if you dont need the lamp, then connect your  to power  and your switched lead to acc.only 3 stars from me for not making the description clear about the nature of the illumination  i was also erroneously expecting the toggle handle to light up."
R2RHWCAX2X8S97,great product.

RK7XPY411X168,"the glow is really dim, this picture is extremely misleading."
RK7XPY411X168,also the material is very hard when just out of the box i.e.
RK7XPY411X168,"cold, but on the plus side that makes for a good grip strengthening exercise."
RK7XPY411X168,i prefer the nonglow versions.
R2U6XR137K3C32,a favorite to play with my grandchildren.
R3SP0G3BZJ9X5I,weve been very impressed by all the folkmanis puppets so hard to choose which ones to get!
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"i was attracted to this as my first drone, thinking that the videooverwifi would be a cheap way to get pseudofpv."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"on my first day playing with it, i got it stuck high up in a tree, where it stayed for two weeks until i could get some long enough bamboo canes 40. it survived the weather for those two weeks, and has survived a regular number of knocks and collisions since, but ive had to use hot glue and reinforcements to repair it on a regular basis."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"however, its now on its last legs, with flight time of only around a dozen hours.durability is a serious issue all beginners are going to crash while learning to fly line of sight, and its unfortunate that the build quality isnt tougher."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"the crash guard is made from thin plastic, which breaks on almost any hard hit where it meets the legs of the drone."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"hot glue does a decent job at repairing it, but the joints should be far tougher, and probably the material improved."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"by the way, the crash guard makes it far more likely to get stuck in trees, so it is a mixed blessing."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"after a collision, one of the drone legs snapped theyre made from a hollow and brittle plastic shell i reinforced it by putting a nail inside the leg and another nail outside, and pouring on plenty of hot glue, in a kind of makeshift splint  that worked well enough, and has held up."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"the real nail in the coffin, though, is that the threads on one axle that the propeller screw attaches to have stripped after taking the prop on and off only 34 times i was trying to figure out why the prop wasnt providing lift, eventually realizing that i was using the wrong prop  the two reds are actually opposite shapes, and you need to replace like for like."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"so, the prop is now glued to the axle, since the screw is useless, which means that the drone is on borrowed time.i could never get the wifi to work."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,holy stone support have been very good they sent me photos of the interior where the wifi board plugs into the main board  their theory is that the plug got loose after a crash.
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"however, since the leg is glued up i cant get at the internals."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"i half thought about using a dremel to cut into it, but thats more time than i want to put into it right now.its quite fun to fly, and responsive."
R3TYRCQTWXC9F2,"the batteries give a reasonable flight time, and its nice that they provide two batteries.in short, a reasonable choice to learn with just exercise some caution while learning."

R1N7TCZXBN66C3,"also, not sure if the main top jewel was ever there i didnt open the package, it was at a bday party but by the time i saw the crown it was missing & looks weird without an actual jewel there."
R1N7TCZXBN66C3,the jewel hasnt shown up anywhere either  or i would try gluing it back on.

R36SRWDTCI9O5R,"big bulky, sturdy figure."
R36SRWDTCI9O5R,"its pretty well articulated, for a larger character."
R36SRWDTCI9O5R,"he just lacks any wrists articulation, which limits his posing somewhat."
R36SRWDTCI9O5R,"and given the fact that his helmet is hes in scale to how i think juggernaut should be, tall and bulky."
R36SRWDTCI9O5R,"if only this figure came with an additional unhelmeted head or better yet, had the option to remove the helmet to reveal cains cranium underneath, it would be prefect.aside from these few minor complaints, the figure is great & well worth getting."
R1JB4O6XEP7SDS,i already own the skyward sword version and its perfect so i thought id add this one to my collection as well.
R1JB4O6XEP7SDS,its cute but the stand that holds it up is extremely flimsy and it falls over with the slightest touch.
R1JB4O6XEP7SDS,plus all the limbs fall off way to easily and it doesnt help that the head makes it too top heavy.
R1JB4O6XEP7SDS,im considering krazy glueing the support peg to the stand so it will be more sturdy.
R1JB4O6XEP7SDS,maybe i just got a bad one?
R350XBGYYE95TQ,very cute decoration for sons 7th birthday party!
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"as soon as i saw them here on amazon, i knew they would be an ideal decoration for upcoming sharkthemed birthday party this past june, but was hesitant at first since i read another review that claimed these were a bit delicate.im so glad i ended up purchasing shark inflatables as they were too cute, with tons of compliments, and as for being easily damaged, our experience has demonstrated these are anything but decorations only!"
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"once we had these blown up a day or so before sons party, he and his rambunctious 4yearold sister just couldnt seem to stay away from the sharks, even as we advised numerous times for them to leave the ""fragile"" decorations alone."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"from sword fighting to rolling around on top of them, every time we would be out of sights range, someone would have to be roughhousing with one of all three of these decorations."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"not sure why this was, it just seemed as though these had some kind of hypnotic pull that kept my children coming for them at every turn."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"finally they were hidden away until the day of the party, which ended up being one of the windiest outdoor parties ever, with 60 mph gusts at times, even tarps surrounding pavilion of park could not keep the horrendous winds from blowing everything, including decorations."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"for these guys, hanging from the top of the pavilion in a triangular formation, they may have gotten some of the worst drafts being higher than some of the tarps extended."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"even so, with so much abuse already dealt to the hapless shark blowups, at clean up time the sharks were taken down and remained full of air."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"some days later, i found the blue shark inflatable in my daughters toy box, tail tied in a knot, yet most of it, everything above the tail still had air in it, as did the other inflatables."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"once kids found inflatables third hiding spot, with the heat of summer bearing down, the pool became their common hangout spot complete with the inflatable sharkswhere they continued to use throughout july and into august."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"i guess i couldve continued to remove the items and find yet another hiding spot, but by then, i figured at least the inflatables are being put to good use other than the onetime birthday decoration they were intended to be."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"it is now almost september, with summer winding down and school around the corner, the sharks are now lying quietly in the pooldeck box, they still contain most of their air that was originally blown into them more than 2 months earlier, with no additional air being applied, and through all the play and well...abuse to put it mildly, they seem to be still going strong."
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"completely worth the minimal price paid, with more uses than decorations, who knew?"
R350XBGYYE95TQ,definitely worth the money!
R350XBGYYE95TQ,"while i wouldnt buy them specifically for use as an inflatable toy, just know they may be utilized in that fashion once their primary function has been performed!"
R350XBGYYE95TQ,recycling is great in any form!
R350XBGYYE95TQ,!
R25UJCBY3BSZLF,cant go wrong with a tribute.
R25UJCBY3BSZLF,it is very slick to me but that is preference.
R25UJCBY3BSZLF,some people like slick tamas and some dont.
R25UJCBY3BSZLF,the ken seems a little heavy but again it is preference.
R25UJCBY3BSZLF,playability and looks are superb.
R25UJCBY3BSZLF,i highly recommend a tribute to a starting player.
R25UJCBY3BSZLF,and if your a veteran you already know tributes are great.
R25UJCBY3BSZLF,i know someone who has been playing for over 10 years playing with toysmiths to ozkras to mugens and still says to this day tribute is in his top 5 of his favorite damas.

R15A4PTJ460QS0,i am writing to share a serious matter of importance as it relates to one of your childrens costumes.
R15A4PTJ460QS0,"i refer to your cell block psycho childrens costume with the description that reads, ""kids will look psychotic with our scary cell block psycho child costume."
R15A4PTJ460QS0,"with a look resembling hannibal lector, no other convict will dare mess with this one."
R15A4PTJ460QS0,"our kids cell block psycho costume includes an orange prisoner jumpsuit featuring torn sleeves, one attached tattoo sleeve, zipper front and ward 1031 print, broken wrist shackle and a brown half face constraint mask."
R15A4PTJ460QS0,the molded plastic half mask features bars over the mouthpiece cutout for the scary look of hannibal lector the cannibal.
R15A4PTJ460QS0,"no one on their cell block will dare to mess with this serial kill mental patient in our scary cell block psycho costume for kids."""
R15A4PTJ460QS0,"my younger daughter, once an honor student, athlete and musician before her illness presented during the onset of adolescence, has lived with schizoaffective disorder for the past six years, and was hospitalized as a child."
R15A4PTJ460QS0,"weve taken her to ucla and stanford, as well as our local hospitals, hoping to make sense of her devastating illness."
R15A4PTJ460QS0,"if you have ever spent anytime visiting a loved one in a childrensadolescents mental health treatment facility, i assure you, you would understand that this costume is painfully cruel."
R15A4PTJ460QS0,childhood suffering is not an appropriate inspiration for a halloween costume.
R15A4PTJ460QS0,vampires are not real.
R15A4PTJ460QS0,"mummies cometolife, monsters and zombies are not real."
R15A4PTJ460QS0,"cartoon characters, fairy princesses and action heroes are not real."
R15A4PTJ460QS0,those types of costumes are appropriate to sell for children for halloween.
R15A4PTJ460QS0,but childhood and adolescent mental illness is very real.
R15A4PTJ460QS0,i doubt you would sell a stage four cancer costume.
R15A4PTJ460QS0,why would you sell a costume that makes fun of a severe brain disorder?
R15A4PTJ460QS0,stigma only encourages hopelessness and despair.
R15A4PTJ460QS0,please reconsider stigmatizing our daughters very real illness by removing your cell block psycho costume and other mental illness inspired costumes from your inventory.

R26G9QINGU0V5C,"the leapfrog scouts build and discover tool set is a dog house that can be taken apart and rebuilt.i think this is a really novel idea to teach higher level concepts of construction, counting and color matching tools to the job."
R26G9QINGU0V5C,"you get five tools a hammer, ruler, saw, screwdriver and wrench.this is not an erector set where you literally have to find pieces and fit them together using the appropriate tools to fasten them.the walls just fold down and handle separates and the youngster is encouraged to use puppy pal scout to guide them through counting and measuring.nothing is literally being hammered or screwed into place."
R26G9QINGU0V5C,"yet in imaginative play, there is a feeling of accomplishment when the thing comes back together.one thing i am sort of surprised with since this is a leapfrog product is a general lack of interactivity.we have other leapfrog products that use various mechanisms to respond to being pressed in certain spots or under certain conditions."
R26G9QINGU0V5C,i dont see those features with this item.
R26G9QINGU0V5C,this one is obviously intended for a younger age range.
R26G9QINGU0V5C,"i think this would be good for a 2,3 or 4 year old.overall  this was wellreceived by my grandson."
R26G9QINGU0V5C,"he seemed kind of in awe with it and since he is on the younger side of that range, was excited when guided through &34building&34 the dog house."
R26G9QINGU0V5C,i find the tools everywhere as he must be reasoning that if he can build a doghouse he can build other things.
R1ELWQ9M8SRXJH,one of the best games ive played in a long time!
R1ELWQ9M8SRXJH,a lot of fun!
R292HOYPJXIA09,this set was a hit with the little ones.
R292HOYPJXIA09,the pieces fit together well and the whole set appears durable.
R292HOYPJXIA09,the nieces and nephews ages 26 have played with it pretty regularly for the last two weeks and the set seems to be holding up well.
R292HOYPJXIA09,the remote is well enough designed for use by an eighteen month old... it goes forwards  and backwards not much to mess up!!!
R292HOYPJXIA09,as the adult... be prepared to tolerate a little noise with this as well..the car is a bit loud.
R292HOYPJXIA09,"still, i definitely recommend it for design, durability, and repeated use and interest!"
R292HOYPJXIA09,"!caveats the instruction sheet is a bit small and hard to follow, but the picture on the box should be enough!!"
R292HOYPJXIA09,consider putting it together the first time without the little ones around to help!!
R292HOYPJXIA09,"it took around 30 minutes just to get all of the three sheets of stickers in the proper places... if you do get this, consider getting a good size storage box."
R292HOYPJXIA09,"this has a pretty large footprint and is the kind of setup that you will probably leave up for a few days at a time rather than putting up every night.all the best,jay"

RXAYHJBIAQI9G,no pets included.
R1XVZ36O6PWFPQ,"within a few days, it began to lose power and got slower and slower."
R1XVZ36O6PWFPQ,"eventually, it just wouldnt go forwards or backwards."
R39IX4C13X2483,great for spa

R1DLJB7J5RYEB0,great!
R2LERET8FIGJJE,my daughter loved getting this with her bitty twins last xmas.
R2LERET8FIGJJE,shes 3 and sits at the table and chairs with them and it has held up very well considering it id not made for people but dolls lol.
R2LERET8FIGJJE,nice wood construction and did not take very long at all to assemble.
R2LERET8FIGJJE,table is very sturdy due to positioning of legs and i needed that with a toddler who loves to climb and read reviews on others where tables easily tipped.
R30FFLEDIK2DX1,really a lot of fun
R8UI509FI01HF,too small.
RG7LOKU5EDTWB,"great product, just like the factory piece."
R1HQHE36G5G0TP,perfect deal for my syma x5c
R21OS246CABMKK,i think all of the words are already said.
R21OS246CABMKK,the figure is purely majestic.
R21OS246CABMKK,the only thing that bothered me was face mold.
R21OS246CABMKK,i love david wenham and i wouldnt say that this mold looks like him.
R21OS246CABMKK,"at most, side view does."
R21OS246CABMKK,but thats not a big deal on a large scale.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,i have say this mask is amazing the craftsmanship on this is incredible i compared it to the video game and it spot on!
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,its very detailed to the point that this mask a presence of its own making a great conversation piece especially around dc comics fans.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,right after i got it i had people come over and immediately after seeing it they wanted to put it on.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,now with all that good stuff said there are a few issues there about five straps in the back of the mask.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,its takes a minute to adjust it.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,the straps are cheap and already tearing so i have to be careful when i put it on and at least in my case the back right corner of the grey part of the mask is sharp and hits my head on occasion so if you have a big head be warned.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,also the fabric is slowly coming apart on the left side.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,this is why i gave it four stars and not five.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,i didnt mind waiting three weeks for it and overall it came out great.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,ill probably buy another one just in case anything else happens.
R1L0CEPP8XMT7M,"i would definitely recommend this item to anyone who is a big dc comics fan, the arrow tv show and batman arkham video games."
R6INC0041ZCIK,great buy
RID4JY0RYH7ZV,exactly what i was looking for!

R2VTTDMRAOYPGH,so beautiful and the quality looks 1st class
RUB4AUWGHG16G,this might be the largest and most accurate elsa ice palace i have seen.the main component of this castle is spinning platform on the bottom that you attach the doll to.
RUB4AUWGHG16G,as you spin her around the second level of the castle also raises up or down if youre cranking the other way.
RUB4AUWGHG16G,"there are steps up the side that are spring loaded when you touch the first step it flips the stairs over into a slide, an elsa portrait that turns around into a mirror, an olaf portrait that is hidden behind a shade."
RUB4AUWGHG16G,a drop down chandelier.
RUB4AUWGHG16G,"plus it comes with a few little accessories, day bed, makeup stationstool, and of course little items like goblets, chests, etc.putting it together is fairly straightforward, some of the pieces are small and the directions arent super clear, but it went together quite easily."
RUB4AUWGHG16G,the best part is that you dont have to put any stickers on.so the final verdict.
RUB4AUWGHG16G,"it looks like elsas ice castle, its quite huge and has a lot of room for playing with 12&34 i.e."
RUB4AUWGHG16G,barbie size dolls.
RUB4AUWGHG16G,"the downside that we see is some of the plastic pieces dont feel all that sturdy, and the weight of the chandelier portion really seems to tilt the castle a bit, kind of making it look like a large piece of cheap plastic toy."
RUB4AUWGHG16G,"our daughter still loves it of course, but i feel its really not justified of its price tag."
R3TA7TXOBEPQ8N,works great

R14VNUKE0UVOEB,too many cinderellas by grail games.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,"this tabletop game is for 24 players that are ages 10  my 8 yr plays, and is about 10 mins long."
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,you play as town people who are spreading rumors for the prince to hear.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,he will pick his cinderella based off of the rumors that you spread.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,anyone can actually become cinderella.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,"a male, senior, or even a cat."
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,"yes, an actual meow cat!"
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,which is my daughters favorite card from this game.i was actually quite surprised how great the quality of this game is.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,the box is made out of a thick cardboard with beautiful bright prints.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,once you open it up.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,all the components fit nicely and wont be rattling around in your box.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,the art work on the lien cards are just beautiful!
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,they use light pastel colors that most princess loving girls enjoy.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,"the ""diamonds"" were both of the girls favorite components."
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,they wanted them all.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,what girl can turn down the silliness and cuteness of the game!too many cinderellas is similar in scope to the love letter games.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,"it is a quick, small deck based game where you earn the most tokens diamonds over a few rounds to win."
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,"each card you lay down has an action, in this case a rumor."
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,its easy enough to talk and enjoy your company while playing.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,"however, its interesting enough to keep you pulling it out to play again."
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,we truly enjoyed this game.
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,"i hope you check it out for yourself, or for a little girl in your life."
R14VNUKE0UVOEB,"my daughter & i like taking this out to our &34coffee&34 dates.ages 10 & up though my 8 yr old playsplayers 24playing time 10 minutesmaterials this game is very well made.recommend it to others yes, quick fun games that is great for princess fans."
R2H1YGVDSRWWPP,"this the what i refer to as our ""get along game."""
R2H1YGVDSRWWPP,every child that has ever touched it starts sharing and teaching each other immediately.
R2H1YGVDSRWWPP,i recommend everyone grab this for your classroom or your game shelf.

R1T2YTR75ITIH2,none of the holes for the canopy mounts were drilled.
R1T2YTR75ITIH2,seems cheap but works fantasticallyfor now.
R1T2YTR75ITIH2,"i really hope it lasts because despite the negatives, it works great."
RZ3OJMIC5YBXG,product arrived fast and our 3yr old loves it.
RZ3OJMIC5YBXG,its big enough to where she can enjoy it for another couple of years but she can still climb onto it by herself.
RZ3OJMIC5YBXG,shes about 3ft tall.
RZ3OJMIC5YBXG,the horse is very soft and the base is sturdy..you do have to assemble it yourself but it is very easy.
RZ3OJMIC5YBXG,just do not over tighten the screws to prevent splitting the wood.
RZ3OJMIC5YBXG,oh and when you squeeze the ear it makes a neigh sound and a galloping sound also

R11QBODW9UDU9E,i highly recommend it.
R3J068II3EA2SO,"as other reviewers have noted, this is a game thats not particularly friendly to newcomers."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"even simply setting up a game takes a ton of time between creating up to six different &34location&34 decks and up to four player decks, youll be spending a lot of time sorting through cards."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"some decks even require you to pick out specific cards from the dozen or so different card categories, so overall the process can get pretty tedious.once we finally got a game going, though, it was pretty fun."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"the basic objective is to search a variety of locations for the villain, fight him a few times, close locations that he might escape to, and eventually kill him."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"combat can get really intense  your success is governed by a mixture of a characters strength, die rolls, and spending valuable cards to increase your chances of success."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"that said, i felt like luck played a little too strong a role in the success or failure of an encounter the strength of a die roll is where youll get the vast majority of your combat power, and this might turn off some players.pathfinder has some really cool ideas, and i particularly like how it handles the concept of &34health&34 and &34equipment.&34 you can carry multiple weapon and armor cards with you in your hand, though you can only bring a limited number of those into an actual battle."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"as for your characters health, your draw deck essentially doubles as this."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"taking damage forces you to discard cards from your hand, and if you run out of cards to draw... youre dead.id like to reiterate that this is not a game thats easy to just jump right into."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"the rules are incredibly complex, and a lot of attention must be devoted to making sure that everything thats supposed to happen actually happens."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"since there are so many cards on the table at once, its very easy to forget to trigger a particular event, and correcting mistakes like this is not always easy.my only other real problem with pathfinder is that i found the artwork to be kind of bland."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"monsters, characters, weapons, etc."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"are drawn on a plain white background, and the world of pathfinder itself didnt jump out at me as anything special.i should also mention that theres a persistent aspect of the game that involves permanently leveling up character cards, progressing through different scenarios, and even permanently removing cards from the game."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"i havent checked this mode out yet myself, but there certainly seems to be a ton of content here."
R3J068II3EA2SO,"if youre willing to invest the time, youll be getting some great bang for your buck."
RZ6JBDC35BC7V,it was a hit for my granddaughter.

R3F3YOTDE9QZLW,i ordered these to put in party favor bags for my daughters lego birthday party.
R3F3YOTDE9QZLW,they were just what we were hoping for.
R3F3YOTDE9QZLW,"each minifig requires assembly put the legs, arms, head, and hat on the body but are individually packaged."
R3F3YOTDE9QZLW,"i liked this because the fun part of legos is building, and the kids loved putting together their own figures."
R3F3YOTDE9QZLW,these are pretty decent quality and are compatible with lego brand bricks and pieces.
R3F3YOTDE9QZLW,the only reason this isnt getting 5 stars is because there wasnt a single minifig that was female.
R3F3YOTDE9QZLW,"small gripe, but it would have been nice to see a female firefighter or doctor or something."
R3F3YOTDE9QZLW,shipping didnt take as long as expected...about a week or so.

R25EA03W6JRWOX,we received this as a gift.
R25EA03W6JRWOX,we were so excited to open this big tub of art supplies!
R25EA03W6JRWOX,"when we opened it, i laughed in disbelief."
R25EA03W6JRWOX,"a cardboard rectangle took up the bulk of the inside, and the inside of the rectangle was totally empty."
R25EA03W6JRWOX,the meager art supplies were between the cardboard & the outside.
R25EA03W6JRWOX,"so look carefully, because what you can see through the sides is literally all you get!"
R25EA03W6JRWOX,the papers are way small.
R25EA03W6JRWOX,the best part about it is having a decent storage bin.

R1RC3PN44WYER8,i received this item and was a little surprised with the size of the puzzle.
R1RC3PN44WYER8,"while the dimensions are listed, the puzzle is small and very thin."
R1RC3PN44WYER8,it is made of wood but it does not seem as if it would be very durable.
R1RC3PN44WYER8,the pieces are thin and have a shallow fit.
R1RC3PN44WYER8,im sure my child will play with this puzzle and love it however i do not believe it will last long enough for another child to enjoy.
R1RC3PN44WYER8,i think that these would be great as party favors but not so much as a thoughtful gift that would last for years to come.
R1RC3PN44WYER8,please be advised i received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
R59A0FJHRU6QS,"i like it  however, it is a bit complicated to use and the instruction manual written in halting english is not very comprehensive."

R1XSZYNLJEEBH7,videoid9c09d470c33afa47b1f8091df63c48a8 i received this awesome kit for review.
R1XSZYNLJEEBH7,i was opening it and my son took over.camouflage is a very interesting and important aspect of animals.
R1XSZYNLJEEBH7,"the book that comes with the block is very informative, well written, has also a soup letter and a picture where you have to find the camouflaged animals.the idea of having dr. cool presenting the book was a plus for my son age 6.the blocks are crystal clear acrylic and safe for the little ones.both my sons attend an stem program based school so this was a big hit among his classmates.cool kit dr."

R2SIPO248K2J3S,i got it for my 1.5 year old.
R2SIPO248K2J3S,"it was easy to put together, appears sturdy enough and decent size for her and a friend."
R2SIPO248K2J3S,its got a cute little battery operated chandelier inside it and a window they can see out.
R2SIPO248K2J3S,you can also buy this at target for $50 which is where i purchased.
RY5SKY09474RV,i really adore this doll.
RY5SKY09474RV,shes super cute.
RY5SKY09474RV,id give her a five if it was only based on how much i liked her.
RY5SKY09474RV,her quality though is pretty mediocre.
RY5SKY09474RV,not sure if this matters if youre just getting her for a child.
RY5SKY09474RV,though i do wish they would make things a bit more durable for when kids play with them.
RY5SKY09474RV,when i opened her box she had some hair bits on her eyes as though someone tried to cut her hair in the box.
RY5SKY09474RV,if you see my picture she has some of her bangs awkwardly clipped on the right side.
RY5SKY09474RV,the hair is a weird texture and not as soft as other dolls.
RY5SKY09474RV,there is some product between her eyebrows from her bangs making it look like a unibrow.
RY5SKY09474RV,there are threads on her dress that are starting to come out as well.
RY5SKY09474RV,the white ruffle on her pink tights are unraveling as well.
RY5SKY09474RV,im not rough with the clothes either i just change them with other dolls.
RY5SKY09474RV,"i do love her choker and the cute, catear belt."
RY5SKY09474RV,"her make up, shoes, and glove paint is nice as well."
RY5SKY09474RV,i just realized that the silver on her choker is suppose to be a thirteen.
RY5SKY09474RV,i thought it was a side ways heart for the longest time haha.
RY5SKY09474RV,i think she looks adorable with draculocker draculauras shoes and is a pretty doll nonetheless.
RY5SKY09474RV,i am even thinking of getting the boo york catty because catty is so cute.
R2Y6AILELI8FOK,super fun game the provides lots of laughs.

R3IBWLG12B684J,"if you collect or give them to be played with, this one is the perfect place to start."
R3IBWLG12B684J,each time you or that special person you gift this to sees this pink baby they will smile.
R3IBWLG12B684J,owl bet you will be happy if you buy her.shipped super fast and the smile came free of charge
R37QP6Z5LU3IAV,got this for my daughter who is now 8 months.
R37QP6Z5LU3IAV,her feet dont touch the ground while sitting on it so i have to hold her.
R37QP6Z5LU3IAV,i guess she will enjoy it more once she starts walking.
R37QP6Z5LU3IAV,she likes to chew on the antlers.the only thing i didnt like was the front legs bend when she leans forward and the toy topples.
R37QP6Z5LU3IAV,i guess this wouldnt be a problem if the child had her feet on the ground but if they didnt they would fall forward.
R3VAF9Y8B264JS,you go beach!?!

R2I0WAWNC6RV1O,"the game was really fun, and not too hard to learn."
R2I0WAWNC6RV1O,"one i got the hang of it and started quickly finishing all the easy cards, i moved on to the complicated cards and it was surprisingly hard!"
R2I0WAWNC6RV1O,"maybe im a bit too old for this game, so it got old after a while, but i could see it staying exciting for kids 612 indefinitely"

R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,topnotch lego set for star wars fans.
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"build difficulty and intricacies medium, but needs teenager at least."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"though a young child can put most of it together, a teenager at least is needed to optimise the build."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,see below.
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,my 5.5 year old took about 7.5 hours to complete this.
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"this is the same time as the ucs bwing, even though the ucs is arguably more complicated."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,this is because of the issue with the pegs that make up the lateral foldout joints of the hull.
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,these pegs cannot be pushed all the way into the socket.
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"if you inspect them carefully, there is a small bulge just below the head of the peg."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"if you push the peg all the way into the socket, it jams the hinge and any attempt to fold out the hull not only causes an annoying squeaking noise, the resistance exerts stress on the lego plates that often leads to parts of the hull falling off whenever you fold it out."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"after discovering this, i had to disassemble the adjacent sections of the hull plates and ask my son to redo it again which is why it took him as long as it did."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,95 into the socket is enough.
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"play value high, considering the size of the set."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"a command centre section that lifts off to reveal the interior, and the upper hull plates folding outward and down to reveal the rest."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"two springloaded missiles that fire forward, with storage for two more at the rear of the bridge."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,swivelling turbolaser cannons on both sides  many minifigures display valueformoney high.
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"it isnt the same as the ucs star destroyer, but it looks impressive and detailed."
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,trivia for star wars vehicle buffs  the proportions of the bridge and the swivelling turbolaser cannons fit the blueprints of a victoryclass star destroyer rather than an imperial star destroyer.
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,see the star wars vehicles and vessels diagrams.
R1TBGXH7FEZ3IE,"this is a minor point really, and does not detract from the beauty of this set."
R1OFM209WLKLBQ,love it
R2PGVD11S93TSR,easy to use and will easily peel off.
R2PGVD11S93TSR,only reason for 3 stars was there should have been more track for the money.
R3U6VT9BBMHVHD,"mine had to be returned, had such a bad drift that i had to keep the stick at 90 counter lock just to keep it in place."
RQANHBCD9W3H3,"the product itself comes in a really nice little metal box, with a stack of sturdy cards and instructions inside."
RQANHBCD9W3H3,one card has a little scratchoff code that you use to download the game to your leappad platinum tablet.
RQANHBCD9W3H3,"the cards are fairly sturdy, but might not hold up to the normal use from a typical 5 year old."
RQANHBCD9W3H3,an 8 year old should be able to care for them well.
RQANHBCD9W3H3,"what is nice, though, is that with the &34digital card picker&34 you dont actually have to have the card to choose to play with it, so losing or mangling a card doesnt render the game useless.leapfrog is a company weve been using for about fifteen years, and im always impressed with how they keep adapting to current technology, and also keeping up with characters that are currently popular."
RQANHBCD9W3H3,mixing teenage mutant ninja turtles with math is definitely a good way to get kids to pay some attention.you can use the cards to play some games without the pad too.
RQANHBCD9W3H3,my kids have fun with using the cards to build equations.
RQANHBCD9W3H3,"i like that there are signs for division and multiplication, and there are also fractions."
R30AH70ALD3XOS,this hoppy horse was the big hit gift  my grandsons 1st birthday party.

R2TBCVT258ZNDL,the card i received was a thundurus ex which was in great condition.
R2TBCVT258ZNDL,"however, in the 100 other cards i received several sets of duplicates sometimes four of a single card but i didnt really have a problem with it and it is never stated that there would be no duplicates."
R2TBCVT258ZNDL,"overall great quality, a couple cards were in played condition but nothing terrible."
R2TBCVT258ZNDL,the cards ranged in set from neogenesis to the most current and the most common set was furious fists.
R2TBCVT258ZNDL,i would definitely buy again.

RHVUBGBN7N665,most people love the millennium falcon.
RHVUBGBN7N665,the xwing is a perennial favorite.
RHVUBGBN7N665,and then there are the contrary types who prefer the star destroyer.
RHVUBGBN7N665,"but for me, my favorite star wars vehicle has always been the snowspeeder."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"it just has that aggressive wedgeshape, with the two ginormous guns mounted and the nifty maneuvering flaps that suggest serious maneuverability."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"the looks just scream &34home brew hot rod,&34 even more than the xwing, showing the philosophical differences between the rebels individual modifications and the empire ruthless conformity and standardization."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"yes, i have to say...the snowspeeder is first in my heart, and lego has done a decent job here.that said, this particular set is not without problems."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"the instructions need just a touch more proofreading, as i noticed at least one spot where a sticker placement was just not listed."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"in addition, i always found it easier to affix the sticker to the brick and then add it to the model...these instructions generally tell you to place the brick first and then add the sticker."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"for some of the elements, like inside the cockpit, this doesnt work very well."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"also, the instructions arent clear on how to use the harpoon gun  we here had to reason it out that the reason the extra piece was on the grapple was to fit in the gun, after which you press the lever and it shoots out of there.second issue i had is the harpoon  yes, the line is fine on its own but in conjunction with other sets, yep, like a previous reviewer said youll find it too short."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"you can certainly hack this by adding your own longer string, but then you run into design issues in that the spool isnt big enough to accommodate much more than the string that is provided."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"using thinner string is an option, but then you sacrifice durability.the added value here are the three minifigures my oldest remarked on the detail of the snowtrooper, and i have to say hes really cool, but at this point i have to give another nit and complain about the trend of twofaced lego heads."
RHVUBGBN7N665,why?
RHVUBGBN7N665,"in this case, the helmets of luke and dak do not completely cover the back of their heads, so you see their chins peeking through on the backs of their heads."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"it was a cute idea when i first saw it with the femme fatale figure in an indiana jones set, but now i think its just getting overdone.another value add are the missile launchers  they work and are easy, if not entirely accurate to the esb film."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"still, kind of neat to launch them across the room, and yes they do have pretty good range for their sizes.so overall, this is a very good set."
RHVUBGBN7N665,"building does require more attention than usual because of the instructions, but the end result is a pretty sturdy ship with great play value.oint i have to give another nit and complain about the trend of twofaced lego heads."

R37M4SO9K84ZQ3,it was really simple to assemble and fun to decorate the box.
R37M4SO9K84ZQ3,i took me only 5 min to set it up.
R37M4SO9K84ZQ3,"so, kids did not get bored and really enjoyed."
R25KTCJIKJALET,"bought it to exceed the minimum for free shipping on an order, as it cost less than the shipping charge would have been."
R25KTCJIKJALET,"life has gotten in the way of getting a chance to play it, but im sure its a good addition to the base game."
R1M5IXNMW89Z7Y,very cool dog tags
R2M2P41XMKP5DB,much much smaller than i thought it was.
R2M2P41XMKP5DB,neat little box but not worth the price.
R2ZTU2JR289KAQ,front bucket is plastic and does not work my son was dissapointed
R6D287FYFHK41,everything was as promised.

R1TJF6NHFHEEQX,good
R2X39H4HUI5UZL,this is a fun puzzle to put together at the beach.
R2X39H4HUI5UZL,individual puzzle pieces are good quality and easy to put together.
R2KZLK86HZ69HN,loved watching my 5 year old granddaughter put this together!
R2V6U6IRC507S9,my kid loves this playset.
R2V6U6IRC507S9,we go all over town with the jacket and helmet on.
R2V6U6IRC507S9,he especially likes the radio that makes noise and the oxygen bottle.my only complaint is with the gloves which dont seem to be made to fit any actual human.
R2V6U6IRC507S9,"theyre like a cartoon of gloves  you can tell what theyre trying to be, but good luck actually putting them on a childs hand and expecting it to stay on."
R76RA950ZFWZC,arrived on time and as expected.
R1RQ0G7GA4ZFB4,best edward kenway figure!
R3A7OOJRGJWTDL,i love it.
R3QNV4QGC6XAPX,good
RLBCB28S24EM8,good.
R1GKK4HCJQF829,i never thought i would have one of these.
R13GGUO12U7KQH,"these loops are super cool except, as many others have noticed, they are indeed very fragile."
R13GGUO12U7KQH,i actually got them for my son who loves magic but hes very young and has a hard time with them because they are super fragile and impossible to see.
R13GGUO12U7KQH,"you must use ""the force"" to work with them."
R13GGUO12U7KQH,theyre probably best for seasoned pros who understand the fragility.
R13GGUO12U7KQH,theyre also very expensive for what they are.
R13GGUO12U7KQH,its too bad because i would buy them more if they were cheaper but its a better deal to just buy the spool of the same elastic.
R13GGUO12U7KQH,i cant handle my son crying each time he breaks one before even being able to show the trick.
R3H0WWGLPO0YKL,my 10 year old girl loves it.
R13EKT4FZPEVR,so cute
R1S350JIM7ZVTI,such an adorable toyrattle!

R1DR6E84LDHFMB,"most 3 to 5yearolds should already have a good grasp of shapes and number recognition, but the math intro is good."
R3N22ZL3P8WAC0,im so happy to receive my dice and cups.
R3N22ZL3P8WAC0,we learned to play aces away while camping.
R3N22ZL3P8WAC0,"my friend had the same cups, i like them and ordered my own right away."
R3N22ZL3P8WAC0,they are worth the money i spent on them.
R2SGCTPS1T90MZ,came on time and looked just like the picture.
R2SGCTPS1T90MZ,great price
R253IA1DGKU35P,"i will not buy other brands of crayons, period."
R253IA1DGKU35P,other brands are more wax than color.
R253IA1DGKU35P,"i have been buying and using crayola crayons for longer than i can remember, and i dont see that changing."
R253IA1DGKU35P,"the paper is nice and thick, but can be a little hard to get off once you need to."
R253IA1DGKU35P,"i also never worry that my son might get sick if he decides to nibble on these, because they are nontoxic."
R253IA1DGKU35P,"the color selection is wide, and the colors are bright and thick."
R253IA1DGKU35P,"keep it up, crayola!"
R12IONGB0K7XZK,great service excellent product

R371Z8Q5B9SD1L,very lifelike.
R371Z8Q5B9SD1L,"similar in size, color and weight to the real eggs my hens lay."
R1X8DX9Y143DZ9,our 3 12 yr olds enjoy the house.
R1X8DX9Y143DZ9,its really a substitute as we could not find a mini mouse boutique house... glad we bought it as its sturdy except the stairs keep coming off.
R1X8DX9Y143DZ9,the girls arent that excited about the furniture but love that figaro is included!
R2HQVXF0NBLZBA,my one year old loves this toy but i dont.
R2HQVXF0NBLZBA,too much talking and singing and no volume control.
RA6N3R7OLPGOE,"paint job was a little scratched and the base was slightly broken, otherwise very nice."
RWWNN7LH83PD5,good
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,i recently got this umbreon in the mail last month.
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,he came pretty quick despite that he came all the way from china.
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,"china may be famous for its bootlegs, but i do love this guy quite a lot!"
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,"heck, he even goes good with my espeon plush, or any eevee plush collection or a collection of other eevee merchandise."
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,"like i said earlier, umbreon did come fast and he came from a pretty reliable seller as well!this umbreon plush is very soft, but the stuffing is somewhat stiff though."
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,"he is well constructed, but there are some flaws with him, all the rings on his body, except for one, which was flawed a little bit, were perfectly made."
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,"his red eyes are beautiful yet fierce looking for a dark type pokemon, similar to a cats eyes."
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,he sadly does not stand up well and does tumble often due to his paws not being pointed down and rather being in a straight line.note there are more bootlegs of this umbreon plush than authentic ones.
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,the ones that are sold on amazon and ebay are mainly being sold by chinese vendors.
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,"if you want an authentic one from japan or the pokemon center usa website and not a bootleg from china or hong kong, you could be out of luck."
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,"the bootlegs are much cheaper, and if you order one, it could be poorly made.despite being a counterfeit umbreon plush, this was worth the money."
R3M9EUEZAYOCN9,any eevee or umbreon fan will be pleased with this.
R3T7ZOTS8FU20D,all of the balls were not stress ball foam.
R3T7ZOTS8FU20D,some are cheaply stuffed with white stuffing.
R3T7ZOTS8FU20D,not happy.
R1D5FF6ZI3WSK3,i would recommend this product for both homeschool parents and teachers.
R1D5FF6ZI3WSK3,"the educational value of the chunky magnet set is high just as a manipulative, but gets much higher when you add the activity cards!"
R1D5FF6ZI3WSK3,as a magnet it functions perfectly.
R1D5FF6ZI3WSK3,"sometimes magnets encased in plastic or surrounded by plastic are weaker or less reliable, the chunky magnet does everything you would expect a magnet to do and more!"
R1D5FF6ZI3WSK3,it has a nice feel to it and all the parts are designed well for big or little hands.
R1D5FF6ZI3WSK3,"cheaper magnet sets are out there, but then you have small hard to organize parts that are not worth it."
R1D5FF6ZI3WSK3,i recommend this magnet set over the many others i have tried.
R1D5FF6ZI3WSK3,"my sixth grade students use it during free time just to explore and play, which is great, but i am already planning to incorporate it into my math and stem classes."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"i always loved &34lilo and stitch&34, and have fond memories of watching the cartoon on tv as a child.experiment 624, known as angel, from the classic disney television cartoon ""lilo and stich the series"", is stitchs adorable and pretty feminine counterpart."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"this lovely plushie of her is quite difficult to come by, so when she showed up at the disney store in my local mall, i purchased her right away."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"i picked her up, held her, and just couldnt leave without her  i am indeed happy that i bought her!"
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,she goes well with my stitch plush and is very nice to hug and cuddle.
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"she is a roughly mediumsized plush, about 10 inches tall, a bit smaller than the disney store stitch plush despite being just as large as stitch as portrayed in the cartoon."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"however, the quality of this plush toy is just spectacular.this is probably the best plushie of angel you will ever find."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"she is accurate, authentic, and absolutely adorable."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,she is made with a velvety fabric that is sublimely soft to the touch.
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"her hotpink colours are very vivid and emphasize her girlish charm, differentiating her from her boy counterpart, stitch.she is very pudgy and cuddly, with a rounded body shape."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"she is stuffed so that she is very squishysoft and huggable, yet she retains her shape perfectly, as she is very wellconstructed and durable.the details are wonderful!"
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"this sweet little mischievous girl alien, angel, has a koalalike look about her, just like stitch."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"she has big black eyes with little lashes, a big round lavender purplish nose, and supersoft, long rounded rabbitlike ears."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,her colouration and markings are spoton.
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"most of her body is a vivid hotpink colour, her underbelly, inner ears, and the rings around her eyes are a soft rose shade, her blunt claws and paw pads are magenta, and she has purplish patches on her antennae and ear tips."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"she has a white heartshaped mark on her chest, and another large purple upsidedown heartshaped mark on her back."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"i particularly love her long, gracefully flowing tendrillike antennae, as well as her cute lil bobtail.one of the paw pads on her feet has an official disney store logo on it, so you can tell it is the authentic product.this is a truly adorable and wonderful plushie, and i highly recommend it to fans of lilo and stitch."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"children and collectors alike will love this angel plushie.i just really wish the disney store would release a big chubby, fluffy plush toy of experiment 625 a.k.a."
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"""reuben"", captain gantus witty sandwichmaking sidekick, who appeared in nearly all of the ""lilo and stitch the series"" episodes whereas angel only appeared in two of them, and is supercute!"
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,"he is so funny and adorable, and so lovable, plump, and cuddlylooking  i dont understand why there wouldnt be a plushie of reuben!"
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,i would love to have one.
R1QVR5ZJMOAJQJ,.

R158DZ8XLE6HQM,this had a great review in a parenting mag so i got it for my 4yo.
R158DZ8XLE6HQM,it was too hard for her to do.
R158DZ8XLE6HQM,my 7yo could easily do it but it really isnt anything spectacular at all.
R158DZ8XLE6HQM,the fun lasts all of 30 seconds and then its back in the closet.
R2XSTCOX4P1WX3,loads of fun to play  like an adult apples to apples
R4NM298B6BRZR,cheap cheap cheap.
R4NM298B6BRZR,feels like it came from the dollar store.

R2SJ5REZFNUGFQ,we bought these masquerades for our guests in our wedding reception.
R2SJ5REZFNUGFQ,"they are quite pretty and did the job, but at least one of our guests struggled with removing the dye that bled from the masquerade all over her face, i felt very embarrassed."

R2VXDUC5GHS7PI,disappointed!
R2VXDUC5GHS7PI,"i paid 13.95 for this, and no beach toys came with it."
R2VXDUC5GHS7PI,"maybe i should of read it clearly, but the bag is worth to the most $2!"
R2VXDUC5GHS7PI,rip off!!!
R2VXDUC5GHS7PI,!

R1Y1CBQYIV2ZUY,this is just great!
R1Y1CBQYIV2ZUY,our grandaughter is almost six months old and she loves it.
R1Y1CBQYIV2ZUY,she is able to sit now and spends half an hour splashing and playing with the rings.
R1Y1CBQYIV2ZUY,the seat back is sturdy enough to hold her.
R1Y1CBQYIV2ZUY,i recommend it 100. just do not leave the child unnattended!!
R1Y1CBQYIV2ZUY,excercise common sense.
RYU9T3X78CBPO,very bad quality compared to the motors i ordered direct from sunnysky.
RYU9T3X78CBPO,"there are visible lathing lines on the metal where it should be smooth, the bearings click right out of the box, and the shaft sticks out much further below the motor than it should.not really sure how these motors can differ so much from each other under the same name."
RYU9T3X78CBPO,"i do not recommend buying these motors from this site, rather go to a reputable sunnysky motor dealer and buy them from there."
R25VVOG6EEC105,awesome game
RRJCHONH3EL2H,my granddaughter loves her pinkie pie.
RRJCHONH3EL2H,she plays with it all the time!
R50AFW0LVTBL1,they broke on me.how did they break?
R50AFW0LVTBL1,they just wouldnt stay on.
R50AFW0LVTBL1,"seems like a battery issue, but it wasntthat is why i gave them 3 stars."
R50AFW0LVTBL1,other than that these were perfect poi!
R50AFW0LVTBL1,"great weight, and great light show!these really grabbed the attention of people who saw them, and &34oh, what is that?&34 could be heard from various people surrounding me!but then they just stopped working."
R50AFW0LVTBL1,"i assumed it was the batteries, and got new ones, but all the new ones i got didnt work.i am sure this was a fluke thing."
R50AFW0LVTBL1,so far this company has been great!i will buy these again in the future.
R50AFW0LVTBL1,especially to go with the pod poi i purchased in place of these.

R12ASHC566CU4G,!
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,i was a little astonished to see the fisher price name on this toy ... one that sports a fisher price price tag.
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"were it not for the actual label, this product feels a little like something one might pickup at a big lots, an ollies or an odd lot you know, those unclaimed freight type stores with the oddball, offbrand toys."
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"its flimsy, lacking attention to detail, and features lots of monochromatic plastic chunks that seem merely to takeup space rather than to be played with."
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"also, for all of you expecting this ""mall"" to fold in half with a little popup handle for travel ... no such thing."
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"the one aspect they ""got right"" was the inclusion of more than one figure."
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,parents have been complaining for years about these disney themed sets that then require mom and dad to pick up extra figures rightly so.
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"here, minnie and daisy are included."
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,nice touch.
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"now, do know that it is from china."
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"i know many, many parents who will not permit their children to have such toys due to the substandard manufacturing processes that does seem to be an issue here, human rights violations, and frequent recalls."
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,this was ignored and discarded pretty quickly by the little ones.
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"it seems, ""what am i supposed to do with it?"""
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,was the reigning answer.
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"and, i can hardly argue."
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,i dont see many activities here ... and i dont see aspects that spark imagination.
R2YW7137YI9YJ3,"for us, on nearly every level, this was not a success."
RFJ3Y67UED8FZ,nice set.
RFJ3Y67UED8FZ,good questions.
R16BCK2ZWVV9EM,two words did not match the picture.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"i had fifteen dollars lying around and my best friends address, so i ordered this for him."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"i had it giftwrapped, added a letter, and sent it to his house."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,it came to his door one day before the estimated delivery date and it shipped to the east coast from california.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"the box was much larger than the product great for storage, thanks amazon."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,the gift wrapping was high quality and matched the classic amazon colors im saving it for this christmas.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"for a singlepiece plastic item, my friend was very impressed with the packing, it was surrounded in wrapping paper and air cushions regifted as toys for my pets."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"he said the wand itself came exactly as pictured and the plastic felt very durable, with the star and handle are one molded piece and very hard to break apart."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"the rainbow gradient would match any pink or purple fairy, princess, witch, or stripper costume."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,at first i did not believe him.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,my friend gave this to his younger sister she is 18 months old when she was crying.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"not only did she stop crying, she was intrigued by the amazing build quality of this magic wand and played with it for the next 30 minutes."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"an hour later, my friend found it in his goldfish bowl, with mr. goldy his pet goldfish swimming through and around it."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"holding it from the top end, my friend was able to use it as a replacement drum stick when one of his broke, until he could get a new wooden one."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,i truly believe it is a fivestar product.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"at such a cheap price, it comes out on top  compared to other magic or costume wands anywhere."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,i visited his house and he showed me this wand i bought for him.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"i was amazed at not only the amazing quality of this product, but also at the fact my friend was telling the truth."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"this product is now in an antique display case above the headboard of his bed, being saved for the generations that will follow him, to spare them from the fate of horrible, everexpanding chinese build quality."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,here are 13 reasons you should consider buying this item 1. great for any fairyprincess costume.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,2. toys for your pet dog or cat.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,3. shipping box large enough for future storage or moving.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"4. durable plastic, capable of receiving abuse."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"5. exactly as pictured, excluding white backdrop."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,6. brilliantly colored rainbow gradient.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,7. great centerpiece for a room.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,8. decent temporary drum stick.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,9. entertainment for a small child.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,10. good aquarium prop for a small goldfish.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,11. reestablishes trust with close friends.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"12. spares you from cheap, chinese toys."
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,13. madly hilarious entertainment for a teenager 16. cons 1. there was no instruction manual.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,2. it is not a sixpoint star.
R3UQ04JVC2PFL2,"for the $15 i spent on this product, the return on investment is astounding."
R32Y2USXLJG2XZ,"well, for less than $30, this is a tremendous doll on amazon."
R32Y2USXLJG2XZ,there are some incredibly cute things about this doll.
R32Y2USXLJG2XZ,the first is her heartshaped belly button.
R32Y2USXLJG2XZ,"also, her clothes come off easily."
R32Y2USXLJG2XZ,the doll is 100 machine washable and that alone is worth the price of admission.i have not really identified any drawbacks.
R32Y2USXLJG2XZ,i think this doll is a home run.

RUZ7U5PWM0HR2,this game is an amazing 2player abstract strategy game.
RUZ7U5PWM0HR2,"if you like strategy games, then get it quick before it goes out of print."
RUZ7U5PWM0HR2,i see that yinsh is really hard to get and it is my favorite of the series.
RUZ7U5PWM0HR2,"the whole series is amazing, but skip punct if you should choose to skip one."
RUZ7U5PWM0HR2,"start with yinsh, dvonn, or tzaar if you are going to get one."
R1C0EJQPP1JHWW,my nephew loves it.
R1C0EJQPP1JHWW,thank you for fast shipping.
R2NIN4HQGPDP0L,"just okay really sums it up.the canopy doesnt stay up regardless of how inflated it is...even appears as if the velcro is placed incorrectly which is what actully holds it up.additionally if your child isnt in the top  for weight, they are guaranteed not to fit in the mesh seat."
R2DU53KVQNE85K,love this game
R2LDWKRJZ8VME8,this backpack is more thicker and sturdy than the walmart brand.

R3C6HRR4I8K4V7,"although its light its not flimsy, studier than many water toys of this kind."

R36IKWWC4Q8D59,"it has no offensive or dangerous features, other than small parts."
R36IKWWC4Q8D59,"based on what im seeing, it will make them happy."
RL989U5FYCULG,kids are 4 & 7. i love how it forces them to use their imagination.

R1R6C614PEZWB0,i love how a kid can really use their imagination and creativity to design their own play set.
R1L8XHCF54I2ZY,as we all know the great quality of ravensburger puzzles this one by no far is as good.
R1L8XHCF54I2ZY,the pieces are thick and not 2 pieces stuck together.
R1L8XHCF54I2ZY,i will say it is a little hard with all the brown and a lot of the details are the same.
R1L8XHCF54I2ZY,but if you love ravensburger puzzles then i say go ahead and get it if you want a puzzle that isnt to hard but not to easy either.
R203M8R2ELJTI3,"its munchkin, and the theme is adventure time.it is a fine game, and the makers of munchkin did a good job integrating in the tropes of adventure time.interestingly, adventure time is one of the best translations, because every episode is really about metaphorically kicking in the door and finding cool stuff."
R1G7CRGE1DSSM,its perfect i will probably be buying more
R24QDHYC8SZLEC,son and his cousins love these.
R24QDHYC8SZLEC,"lots af kids can play on ""team"" mode."

R7E189ZETSON1,who doesnt love jenga?
R7E189ZETSON1,!
R27L2RRGWG391A,i love folkmanis puppets and own several.
R27L2RRGWG391A,as some others noted the mouth was a little difficult to operate and doggie was pretty floppy.
R27L2RRGWG391A,but as soon as the little birthday opened her present she hugged it and gave me the biggest smile.
R27L2RRGWG391A,she loves her new puppy.
R6AAMJWBDZQWI,works well and costs way less than the new bunches.
R6AAMJWBDZQWI,had my kids refill the straws with the balloons and let them have fun.

RAMTGGTJG8FM6,it fits both my 2 and 11 year olds.
RAMTGGTJG8FM6,"the two year old of course its a little larger on, but it does fit both of them."
RAMTGGTJG8FM6,the shiny silver fabric shines nicely.
RAMTGGTJG8FM6,thanks for letting me try this out so i could review it.
R2GS4DWEKDODCH,fun but it broke after a few uses.
R2GS4DWEKDODCH,farts uncontrollably when turned on.
R2GS4DWEKDODCH,which is funny on its own i suppose
R3BGP4BMRLUYE2,bought two to put out at the end of our driveway when kids are playing outside and they worked like a charm right out of the gate.
R3BGP4BMRLUYE2,i heard a sudden deceleration from every car that rode by when the driver spotted them.
R3BGP4BMRLUYE2,"it was music to my ears!the flags are wound up pretty tight outofthebox as others have stated, and will require a little extra work in order to get them to flatten out.the units are pretty sturdy."
R3BGP4BMRLUYE2,we live in a pretty windy area and even without any sand in the base they didnt topple over.
RXIM7LQ3DHTEE,fun game
R29SGKPTWY70O7,i was drunk and bought 10 of these.
R29SGKPTWY70O7,we have too many roaches.
R29SGKPTWY70O7,wed have less if we were filthy.
R29SGKPTWY70O7,my roommate put one on the shower head and i fell when i saw its beady eyes looking at me from such a close distance.
R29SGKPTWY70O7,ill buy ten more boxes.
R2QAMUE50VJUCK,the forklift delivery was eagerly anticipated by my 2 12 year old grandson.
R2QAMUE50VJUCK,we picked it out together on the amazon.com website.
R2QAMUE50VJUCK,"he was happy when he first saw it, the moving parts were a little hard for the little guy to handle."
R2QAMUE50VJUCK,the two forks were very wobbly and did come off every so often.
R2QAMUE50VJUCK,"my concern was that the forklift toy was very heavy and i was afraid that he could get hurt if it ever would fall on him, like playing on the table top."
R2QAMUE50VJUCK,we have since put it aside and purchased another forklift that was easier to handle and not so dangerously heavy.
R2815DCHV34ASH,arrived on time and as expected.
R3MRBP6U5FIRWC,so cute!
R3MRBP6U5FIRWC,!
R2SDVFKQ65T5BE,good quality back pack and adorable too

R2TWZ8UJAPSTQZ,my 2 year old loves it.
R2TWZ8UJAPSTQZ,"he has tons of cars cars, but needed a tex."
R2TWZ8UJAPSTQZ,i was happy to find it on amazon.
R2N2XMDNUWU8SS,so so cute and soft and more over it has a proper size .my kids really loved it.thank you so much you made their dream come true.
R2QV3Y005O9V59,the package arrived today and mr. smees leg and feet were broken upon arrival see first photo.
R2QV3Y005O9V59,then within an hour the stand for izzy also broke off.
R2QV3Y005O9V59,highly disappointed.
R3R1JUCODA4SL0,"this is the game that wizards of the coast always wanted to make.when i received the first, betaversion of magic the gathering from rich back in 1992, i thought to myself this is a card game version of wizwar, where magicians challenge each other by casting spells and summoning creatures to fight one another.after 23 years, this is the board game for magic the gathering.i like it."
R3R1JUCODA4SL0,"i like it a lot.as with all wotc products, the quality of the components is very high.each player take the role of a planeswalker wizard that summons creatures and spells to attack opponents.once your points are gone, you are out of the game.last wizard standing is the winner.the rules are simple, but they game is infused with the themes and flavor of the collectible card game.there is lots and lots of room for expansions, but the base rules are less than ten pages long and those pages are liberally filled with colorful diagrams and photos.great game!"
R3R1JUCODA4SL0,i highly recommend it!
R3JCVB1DCVNZKV,its so small!
R3JCVB1DCVNZKV,i wasnt paying close enough attention when i ordered it and thought it was a decent size...like something my 2 year old could sit in front of and play like a real drum set sized fora toddler.
R3JCVB1DCVNZKV,but its miniature.
R3JCVB1DCVNZKV,seems a lot more fitting for a 6 month old.
R3JCVB1DCVNZKV,"in fact when my two year old saw it in the box waiting for me to return it, he said ""baby toy?"""
R3JCVB1DCVNZKV,two thumbs down.
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,"this is the first schleich product ive ever had, so i looked up the spinosaurus, and found that experts no longer think it looks like the jurassic park type, but the back legs were shorter and the spine fin was not humped, but rather wavy, and it had webbed feet."
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,"probably, it was an aquatic creature that lived on fish."
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,"that being said, this is still an impressive monster that was the largest dinosaur ever, and the toy is impressive, too."
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,"the detail is most impressive, with the scales, teeth and tongue."
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,"the jaw opens and shuts, but my two year old doesnt mess with that."
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,"hes been in the sand box, playdoh, and tub so far and no chipping of the color or pieces yet."
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,i love that the feet are perfectly balanced.
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,you know how sometimes only two feet are on the ground and the others totter?
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,not this one.
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,it has a good heft to it and even the tongue is raised.
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,the colors dont bleed into another area.
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,this is a high quality product.
R23JWUPNOZLXTM,"my only question is, why did they say it was violet?"
RO4Z2PRQMJTMC,the very same stickers from traxxas.great product im happy with my purchase.
R21N1JBP5HT75Z,thank you!
R7XMUPDEB8HVI,much better and faster than the stock wall trickle chargers.
R7XMUPDEB8HVI,highly recommend to anyone who wants a charger that charges very fast snd isnt so expensive!

R3S70JM0YMFWLE,bought them for band camp water day the kids had a blast
RKO35WAGO1YGV,my son loves these.
RKO35WAGO1YGV,great quality at a great price.
R1N3GDOPMHB2XZ,this model was very easy to put together and was fun too.
R1N3GDOPMHB2XZ,"its tough too, i dropped it a couple of times from off the shelf, and nothing broke not even the little lights, its pretty cool."
R1A4ZQVFDGTTK1,my 2 12 year old grandson wont get out of it!!
R1A4ZQVFDGTTK1,"it is well made, sturdy, and has a working hose!"
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,im really satisfied with this kit.
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"this was my first build of anything rc, and although it wasnt the breeziest thing ive ever done, it was doable without a lot of frustration."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"there are numerous youtube videos that explain how to assemble these kits if you arent sure what youre doing, so id recommend those.the kit includes most of what i needed, but i had to buy nylon hex spacers for mounting the flight controller after the kit came because i assumed there would be some included, but there were none."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,there were all the screws needed and some extra but no spacers.
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"there is some piece of an adapter that comes in the kit that i can only assume is a battery connector, but i opted to buy some xt60 connectors because that seems like the new standard.once i got it all assembled, the kit is very very sturdy."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"it does not feel like its going to break easy, and after 6 days of flying and probably 20 crashes, it does not seem to have any structural issues."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"ive cartwheeled it in tall grass plenty of times, and while the plastic props i bought can get bent easily, the frame holds up great."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"i did break a small piece of it off in the back by flying backwards into a house, but even so its still very sturdy."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"the carbon fiber blades that come with it are good quality, and they fly much steadier than the plastic gemfans i bought, but i was able to break one pretty easily nonetheless."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"they hold up great for crashes, but dont let them hit anything hard like concrete because they can break more easily.one of the downsides of this kit that i didnt like is that the holes for the motor were not drilled out enough."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,i had to drill all of the motor holes out more myself.
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"not only was it too narrow for the screw to fit, the holes werent tall or wide enough to accommodate the screw hole patterns on the motors."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,be prepared to have to drill the motor mounts.
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"and i was able to loose the dampening camera mount easily so id say dont fly with it on unlessyou are going to use it.everything in the picture comes in the kit, including the two wire pieces and the two heat shrink cables."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"i was a little concerned that it might not come with a power distribution board because it was not listed in the description so i bought another one anyways, but i can confirm that it comes with one inside the kit."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"all in all, this was a great buy and im really happy with it."
R3N65FCMYEKQWE,"i mean, you cant beat the price, this has the same stuff that kits that cost 50 dollars more have."
RZDJ745R6JEUL,"i have a grandson that is huge for his age weighing in at 43 pounds, and this works perfect.for him."
RZDJ745R6JEUL,i only wish they made something like this with a sun shade.
R2OFNPUOT79ZSR,"this owl was a gift, it is adorable!"
R2OFNPUOT79ZSR,the mommy and baby girl loved it!

R1B551LEPP3UC3,a good strategypuzzle game to make you plan ahead.
R1B551LEPP3UC3,friends enjoyed playing it.
R1B551LEPP3UC3,doesnt go toolong per game.
R2TNKEHZM54T17,"this minnie mall is super cute for toddler girls.this is very well made, sturdy and portable."
R2TNKEHZM54T17,"box is actually a carrying case with handleyou can easily transport this around and the bright colors are eye catching and makes everything pop!the set comes with 3 mini figurines which are minnie,daisy and figaro."
R2TNKEHZM54T17,"since they are tiny children may put them in their mouth, so please be watchful."
R2TNKEHZM54T17,"there are a lot of other cool amenities that come with this such as the moving escalator, revolving doors,carousel, food court."
R2TNKEHZM54T17,etc....just like an actual mall!
R2TNKEHZM54T17,this is going to be a hit come christmas.
R3CQQ4V8B3LT6U,very disappointed in this item.
R3CQQ4V8B3LT6U,"was excited when it arrived, its super cute."
R3CQQ4V8B3LT6U,"but within the first two days the lobster clasp broke, and then it fell apart."
R24VAW5USOBNJI,works like a champ and has the volume to be heard at a pretty good distance.
R24VAW5USOBNJI,"i purchased this as a backup to my telemetry on my radio, and a few times its gone off a minute before my transmitter figured out i was getting low."
R24VAW5USOBNJI,nice to have a backup
R2I4QX1RJKJXZW,my 4 year old loves it.
R3QUHC2V0I8E2K,on time...good quality.
R33U4XSUBLATBO,actual lunch box size is ridiculously small.
R33U4XSUBLATBO,cant really be used by a fourth grader.
R1HBDCR3G0XQKG,"yes, it did, my grandson, 4 years old, is enjoying this toy very much indeed."
R1HBDCR3G0XQKG,it has been a good election.
RVR95LRBZURXZ,"this is not really a 4speed transmission, you cannot shift gears."
RVR95LRBZURXZ,"what it is is a gearbox with 4 gear ratio options.this kit is fairly easy to assemble, but beware, there are many small pieces."
RVR95LRBZURXZ,"the instructions recommend using the included grease, but i found that the grease added significant drag."
RVR95LRBZURXZ,i doubt that the gears will wear unless you plan on running it constantly for long periods of time.
RVR95LRBZURXZ,i chose to clean the grease off in favor of reduced drag.
RVR95LRBZURXZ,you will also need to clip the base plate for it to fit.
RVR95LRBZURXZ,if you are using onei am using this for a bluetooth arduino robot.proseasy directionsconsthe grease adds excessive drag
R1UMEC1PCFY03E,great cube!
R1UMEC1PCFY03E,"it was delivered within a week, packaging was good, and overall the cube is great quality."
R1UMEC1PCFY03E,i recommend it to anyone!

RS4LQSUL30XRJ,nice cutters in a variety of shapes.
RS4LQSUL30XRJ,have not used them yet so will have to submit more later.

R3A07EPQCU2UVF,you can check the unboxing and the presentation for this set here
R3272FD87U0ZRU,i received these bracelets at a discount in exchange for my review.these bracelets are not as bright as the picture would indicate but theyre still a lot of fun.
R3272FD87U0ZRU,there is a switch for you to change whether the bracelet flashes or stays steadyon.
R3272FD87U0ZRU,the led bulb changes color in each mode.
R3272FD87U0ZRU,you can also switch it off.
R3272FD87U0ZRU,"when i received my package, one of the bracelets had gotten switched on in transit and the batteries were almost dead."
R3272FD87U0ZRU,but the others were in perfect condition.
R3272FD87U0ZRU,these would be fun at a 4th of july party or maybe wear them to a night club with friends.
R3JAPXX8FLZTPJ,loved it!
R1OHNLLMA3PWLJ,we took this game on our family vacation because it took up little space and because the original apples to apples the older kids had already.
R1OHNLLMA3PWLJ,we played this game with children that had a limited reading ability.
R1OHNLLMA3PWLJ,they had watched older siblings play the regular game but could not keep up with them.
R1OHNLLMA3PWLJ,this allowed everyone to play.
R1OHNLLMA3PWLJ,a picture is certainly worth a thousand words.
R1OHNLLMA3PWLJ,everyone had a great time playing it.
R1OHNLLMA3PWLJ,most of the pictures are really funny.
R22U5HQOU8972P,horrible material!!!
R22U5HQOU8972P,so cheap !!!
R22U5HQOU8972P,"sharp corners, very cheap plastic... phone, stethoscope, beeper dont work!!!"
R22U5HQOU8972P,"the case is horrible, you cant even close it!"
R22U5HQOU8972P,"so uneven and sharp edges....so not worth the money.... i could get those toys at dollar store... im really disappointed with learning resources... i got another toys from this company, i thought they were going to be as good as they were.... im gonna think twice next time before getting anything from learning resources.... i usually dont write reviews but im so upset about this product that i had to say something about it..."

R1HGS7S408SQTT,"the string did not hold, so i used asinb0000ay6ac 3m marine 5200 adhesive sealant, white, 1 oz to seal it to my front door lamp which didnt have any sort of cover."
R1HGS7S408SQTT,now i have a glowing stormtrooper to guard my door & hes stuck tight since last year.
R1HGS7S408SQTT,"now all i need is a motionsensing speaker to say ""move along!"""
R1KUMEA8HL884M,"cheapest quality ""do it yourself"" kit i have ever purchased for my kiddos."
R1KUMEA8HL884M,the screws continously fall out as you pound your hammer on it in attempt to add the additional screws it directs you to do.
R1KUMEA8HL884M,planes fell apart within minutes of kids finishing them due to the building materials being so cheap!
R1KUMEA8HL884M,waste of money.
R1KUMEA8HL884M,home depot & lowes kits are 100x better quality!
R3QKEP2VFOYCHG,my daughter is happy with it.

R2EVHZNUYG1VE5,great product for little girls.
R2EVHZNUYG1VE5,"my daughter loves to carry around her ""purse."""
R2EVHZNUYG1VE5,she usually carries it empty because it is a little heavy when all of the toys are in it.
R2EVHZNUYG1VE5,i love that this toy has so many different things for your little one to play with.
R2EVHZNUYG1VE5,if they get bored with one toy there are several others to choose from.
R2EVHZNUYG1VE5,"the opening is a little small, however, i just ripped the sides a little to make it wider and that problem was fixed.. i love that it has babies with the skills of pulling things out and putting them back in."
R2EVHZNUYG1VE5,super cute toy!
R9NS08Y927WKI,this was an excellent buy for the price.
R9NS08Y927WKI,the train was bigger than i had expected and had movable parts.
R9NS08Y927WKI,my granddaughter loves it.
R2B6J3VSEIZFLG,nothing bad about it.
R2B6J3VSEIZFLG,just a relatively bland figure in terms of a bgrade villain with no accessories.
R2B6J3VSEIZFLG,the fin is nice and the figure is menacing looking and finely made.
R2B6J3VSEIZFLG,if you need more villains for your heroes or want ultrons arm the full ultron is pretty amazing though go for it.
R13A99CG5X46PA,beautiful toy!
R13A99CG5X46PA,loved it
R1MEYV2B6AS7PB,amazing motor and esc 50mph might buy more in the future
R327A3QEHHXYMB,"my cat, izzy, loves this toy."
R327A3QEHHXYMB,"fortunately, when it falls over its wheels stop & ive not had to worry about her fur getting tangled in the wheels.izzy, has almost figured out how to turn it over & get &34shamrock&34 going again, lol i am always present when she is playing bc of the fur tangling concern."
R25ATSKWAOTFL5,this puzzle is absolutely beautiful but the pieces themselves leave a lot to be desired.
R25ATSKWAOTFL5,pieces do not fit snuggly together and it is often unclear if they actually fit.
R25ATSKWAOTFL5,the birder took forever bc of this reason.
R25ATSKWAOTFL5,i like the art work but would not ever buy another puzzle from this company.
RX6G1WNTL6RW,"we love the colorful theme and what separates mountain from the &34others&34 is their piece construction...good thickness, feels like quality and the pieces fit like a glove!!"
RX6G1WNTL6RW,please come up with some more great designs !!
RX6G1WNTL6RW,"!the best tennis players of all time....golf too, etc &34teddy never looked so good in multiples!!"
RX6G1WNTL6RW,!.....please give these to your &34thinker&34mana...meow
R3A7ILRJTDV38H,my grandson loves this.
R3A7ILRJTDV38H,it is getting well used.
R1V32QMNG3LODV,good deal good price
R38HMFNVE3Y6V,like it
R2VU6PS5BL7M3X,kicking myself for not getting one of these decades ago!
R2VU6PS5BL7M3X,takes a couple of tries to get the knack but then its worth its weight in gold.
R6A98H1L21QTQ,its okay.
R6A98H1L21QTQ,its not as wide as i thought it would be because the beans inside round it out and make it thinner.
R6A98H1L21QTQ,"also the beans dont stay in one section, they go all over the place so trying to get it even is really hard."
R6A98H1L21QTQ,if you dont get it even you will float crooked.
R6A98H1L21QTQ,you have to be careful to make sure you dry this out thoroughly or it will mildew as it says in the instructions but not in the advertisement.
R6A98H1L21QTQ,its very heavy to pull out of the water so you have to wait for some of the water to drain out which can take awhile.
R6A98H1L21QTQ,i got this because i have three golden retrievers that swim and i didnt want something that would puncture.
R6A98H1L21QTQ,as much trouble as it is it will never get punctured not only because of the design but because i probably wont use it much.
RFRBD1OCTAYMJ,my son loved it.
R2K9X27DMAHH4F,least favorite of three riding toys.
R2K9X27DMAHH4F,cant self propel well.
R2K9X27DMAHH4F,"durable, and they enjoyed that it could spin when they were pushed."
RZMO8WWIYIHCU,bought this to entertain grandsons.
RZMO8WWIYIHCU,they have really enjoyed it.
RZMO8WWIYIHCU,it keeps them busy on the front lawn for an hour or more whenever we break it out.
RZMO8WWIYIHCU,thats time they arent buried in their cell phones of their tablets.
RZMO8WWIYIHCU,outside in the fresh air is a good thing.
RZMO8WWIYIHCU,my grandsons are 13 and 12.
R2HAM5JWDR5HR7,exactly as described
RGPZN4OBIXWM,good figure like the way it moves always like the we elite series
R39ZIZEVFWIRPL,belle objet de collection!
R275ILKGCWQIB3,these zombie action figures  or as i call them zombie army guys are awesome!
R275ILKGCWQIB3,my son loves them he is really into army guys and zombies both so these action figures are just what hes been looking for.
R275ILKGCWQIB3,"they are made very well, with a sturdy plastic."
R275ILKGCWQIB3,they stand up very well while hes playing.
R275ILKGCWQIB3,the tube the come in works well for storage also.
R275ILKGCWQIB3,i would definitely recommend these to anyone.
R275ILKGCWQIB3,i received these at a discount for my honest review.
R2CQB8M3HL0SPD,this is a great little set that was super easy to put together and is making my 2 year old very happy!
R2CQB8M3HL0SPD,i love that it is made with metal and sturdy unlike several cheap plastic options.
R2CQB8M3HL0SPD,quick delivery and quality product.
R2CQB8M3HL0SPD,ill buy more from this company!
R2C4SA0HPU0HOP,"when i received this product, it was missing one tray."
R2C4SA0HPU0HOP,"it says it holds 28 but the one i received only held 24. also, these do not hold 3ds games."
RX07U6D1CXUP6,happy with my purchase.
R1ABJHVH6AA1WV,love it
R1BOKV682WTA7F,perfect!
R2LPC8VTT3HBW0,thats it.

RSPIR56AULZ9V,kids love it.
R2MXKNRHFF2YP4,i bought one of these at the beach a couple years ago for less than $5.
R2MXKNRHFF2YP4,no way is it worth $30.
R36UY2T0T4IO28,everything was as promised.
R36UY2T0T4IO28,thanks!
R2HZNG143M2ZW9,i purchased this when it was a lightning deal and i think it was a great value to buy both items as a set instead of purchasing separately.
R2HZNG143M2ZW9,i gave this as a gift to a 7 year old boy and he loves it!
R2HZNG143M2ZW9,it was a huge hit at the birthday party and all the kids were playing with it.
R2HZNG143M2ZW9,both items were ready to use out of the package and did not need any batteries or assembly.
R2HZNG143M2ZW9,"if there were any instructions, we didnt read them because it was easy enough for the kids to figure out how to use these on their own.the vaccuum isnt very strong but it was enough to trap bugs."
R2HZNG143M2ZW9,it would be great it there were a reverse setting to help get the bug into the critter barn!
R2I8YETRD882QY,my daughter wanted a honu and this one fit the bill.
R2I8YETRD882QY,super cute and huggable she definitely loves this turtle.
RTL1AXW0GM2AU,this is a nice set.
RTL1AXW0GM2AU,soooooo glad i bought this!
R2D0RA5WTPVTWS,fun game
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,"cool idea, especially if the child shows interest in decorating cakes and such."
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,the spotlight is cool but the motorized spinning isnt really a great idea.
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,it doesnt really go at a speed that you can use.
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,i would suggest just spinning it by hand.
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,"it comes with two rather small, plastic, reusable items to decorate  a vase and a dishcontainer."
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,"there are also 3 cardboard discs included to decorate, which are really kinda cheaplooking."
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,the styler is reminiscent of a caulking gun  you load it with a deco pop filled with playdoh and squeeze.
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,i really dont like purchasing products that require additional purchase of consumables.
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,i wish you could refill the deco pop containers by hand.
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,"however, i dont see that it will be a big problem, since i believe most kids will tire of this before you need to purchase many refills."
R2F5RO7C75LTRR,not bad for a rainy day afternoon project but not really a long term item.
R1YNC6HDUZ4HAH,i had to buy a phone for my 9 month old because he kept trying to go for my iphone.
R1YNC6HDUZ4HAH,"he loves his new phone, my only problem is he dropped it once and now repeats one song over and over and we have to turn it off."
RLBIOU95GLLAI,my lil girl loved this even did a baby tuturial
RB9SF0QQL7980,this toy is larger than i thought it was going to be!
RB9SF0QQL7980,my toddler loves it!
RB9SF0QQL7980,very good quality toy and considering the size of this thing also a good value for the price.
RB9SF0QQL7980,colors are true to the descriptionpictures.
RB9SF0QQL7980,will definitely be buying more of these for christmas gifts.
RB9SF0QQL7980,i received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
R2BC6DVX4F6GEB,fun!
R16TGNXY9Z7ZEK,just right.
R16TGNXY9Z7ZEK,assembled fast.
R16TGNXY9Z7ZEK,"looked at many others, this one was best for the money."
R16TGNXY9Z7ZEK,very sturdy and the umbella does its job.
R16TGNXY9Z7ZEK,wish it was a little bigger.
R16TGNXY9Z7ZEK,just using water right now because the littlest one wants to eat the sand.
R16TGNXY9Z7ZEK,our two grandkids love it.
R16TGNXY9Z7ZEK,will buy another when other grandkids get a little older.
R3BCZUS3RAUEJZ,very nice.
R3BCZUS3RAUEJZ,shipped well.
R3BCZUS3RAUEJZ,thank you.

R266QHGM9OAG55,thats all that matters.
R266QHGM9OAG55,im happy!
R1TFLSWJRXBYTG,were great fans of schleich products  they are heirloom toys quality meant to last several kids rather than the play and destroy cheap toys so prevalent today.
R1TFLSWJRXBYTG,"as well as hand details and care, expect a very nice product that you can that displays beautifully when not in use."
R1TFLSWJRXBYTG,"so yes, very much worth the higher cost.with the riding arena set, we have a nice introduction to the schleich horse world."
R1TFLSWJRXBYTG,"the set includes a beautiful handpainted horse, saddle and accessories that can be outfitted, and a riding paddock area with fence."
R1TFLSWJRXBYTG,"it may seem sparse at first but when paired with the playmat that is sold separately, it makes for quite a nice set piece."
R1TFLSWJRXBYTG,what we like about the arena is that it is open  so the horse can be easily seen when played with  the building doesnt get in the way.
R1TFLSWJRXBYTG,opening windows make an additional nice touch.we greatly enjoy our schleich horses and sets and i enjoy having a toy that can be passed down to each child and then saved for grandchildren one day.
R29JPKM4P89367,little be small but looks well.
R1J8TJEJ61YE07,very nice
R2R3V25SCHSBJY,"fun, not predictable."

R2HEG4K9FQM4KB,every shengshou from 4x4 up gets better every extra layer.
R2HEG4K9FQM4KB,i have 47 and this is the best so far.
R2HEG4K9FQM4KB,far better than the 6x6.
R2FMNULB8ZUMNW,"consistent with the japanese price, not bad!"
R5T67F8IBQ6OD,everything was as promised.
R5T67F8IBQ6OD,thanks!

R3GQ13MYCJQR1U,this is a very cute set.
R3GQ13MYCJQR1U,my daughter loves it.
R3GQ13MYCJQR1U,"the only thing i wish i had known is that the loom is foam, and not very sturdy."
R3O14Y7TXIMPOD,great little game
R12QC51AX8ME1K,my son loves this.

RWL0WVIVY3XXY,my grandson loves to play it and the whole family has fun with it.
RIS2CKDHNOC2S,they have a lot of power but to get them to fit correctly they are too large and will need the copter modified
RX7IHPBWLNZLY,"cute, just as pictured."
RX7IHPBWLNZLY,i could definitely see myself buying more.
R2OQX8CZPNG344,broken when it arrived
RJAZE927DPHWL,love it
R2G9L8OLGR9HSE,i bought several of these for my grand daughter.

R2G9L8OLGR9HSE,thank you
R2FLV5GTPI7VZA,nice price for paper!
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,we had a great time completing this puzzle!
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,"the last puzzle we completed was back in the late 90s, so we were pretty rusty."
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,"i thought it was pretty challenging and we had to constantly reference the box illustration, especially for the kelp, mermaid tail, and mermaid hair."
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,we spent about 4550 total hours between the two of us to complete it.
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,"i think without looking at the box illustration, it would have taken us twice as long to complete!"
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,"so many times we thought a piece must be missing, but then we would find it and laugh.we separated out the edges first, and once we got the border complete, there were still several &34edge looking&34 pieces left that ended up in the middle, which made it more challenging and i thought this was a nice touch."
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,"there were also a lot of very unique curvy pieces, which added to the fun."
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,"there were two instances where two pieces were still connected to each other as they hadnt completely been punched through, which was no big deal.the overall quality is great!"
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,"it really is a beautiful puzzle, as other reviewers have stated!"
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,the illustration is very vibrant and colorful.
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,we plan to glue and then frame it!
RQ880SFFC9Z1Q,we look forward to our next sunsout puzzle!
R13K0ZH2ALAFGV,my 14 yr old loves this game.
R1C98GJJFYN0C4,love this doll!

R2B4Y73Q36KTU1,it is nice
R3B6UXAZCFXZ91,arrived on time and as expected.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,my boys  now in their 30s loved tmnt so i thought my 5 year old grandson might love them too.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,i was right.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,he was right on this game and enjoyed playing with it right away.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,he plays games on my kindle all the time so hes got it down pat.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,they are so quick now.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,when i was five we had a huge &34fun with dick and jane&34 book on our desks.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,sigh.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,i am aging myself.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,these kids are just so much more clever.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,there are two things that i am not crazy about.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,the cartridges are now cards.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,"even though they come in a really great tin box that my grandson loves, it would be easy to lose them or bend them."
RRSH12FZG5Y94,my daughterinlaw is very good about these things but i worry about that.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,the other thing i dont care for is that you must complete a level to move one.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,"this may be good for adult gamers, although i admit i get frustrated with that, but for kids it doesnt take long before they get bored and put it aside."
RRSH12FZG5Y94,theres just so many times hes going to try before he loses interest.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,he is having a wonderful time and learning math so you cant beat that.
RRSH12FZG5Y94,i love the leapfrog product and have never been disappointed with the quality.
R2GRGU9HBYWZ0K,only true fans will love this doll... voice and clothes are great...dolls face...needs work
R2AYGT2B687ARB,"i love these puzzles, but,... the last three white mountain puzzles ive gotten have all been missing one piece."
R2AYGT2B687ARB,strangest thing!
R2AYGT2B687ARB,i talked with another friend who gets white mountain puzzles and its happened to them twice.
R2AYGT2B687ARB,maybe its their m.o.
R2AYGT2B687ARB,"i love the puzzles, but frustrated by the one missing piece!"
R2Y61UYJCMJC14,i love elephants.
R2Y61UYJCMJC14,my favorite animal.
R2Y61UYJCMJC14,"i got this guy as i was going through a breakup i knew i needed something to cuddle and cry on at night or when i felt lonelyat first, i hesitated because it is pricey and you would think that with such a high price, it would have gotten 5 stars from every reviewer."
R2Y61UYJCMJC14,but many said it was poorly made or didnt look like an elephant at all.went ahead and ordered this guy and fell in love when i got him.
R2Y61UYJCMJC14,he is soo big and plushy.
R2Y61UYJCMJC14,had no problems when i washed him.
R2Y61UYJCMJC14,"though the ears sag, he still looks like a beautiful elephant to me."
R2Y61UYJCMJC14,named him captn rogers and he is always next to me when i sleep.
R2Y61UYJCMJC14,this guy is gonna follow me everywhere.
R1ZUI6WYGR5I3G,i got this for my birthday.
R1ZUI6WYGR5I3G,it didnt work.
R2MQKVP7NZK015,this is my first remote control aircraft and i love it.
R2MQKVP7NZK015,its very slow so it gives you time to turn it before it collides with a tree.
R2MQKVP7NZK015,but if you have the wind at your back you go flying literaly.
R2MQKVP7NZK015,noting wrong with a pun every now and then if you have a child how wants an rc plane this is by far the best choice for your smaller kins folk.
R2MQKVP7NZK015,it can fly for about 7 minuets and charging time is about 45 minuets.
R2MQKVP7NZK015,the remote control is powered by 4 aa batterys.
R2MQKVP7NZK015,the plan is powered by a costum battery that plugs into the remote to recharge.
R2MQKVP7NZK015,it a bit of a struggle to put the battery in the plane so have patientsas far as i can say its a great plan for beginner pilots.
R2O3YUPITL591M,a very nice  heavy gauge wire for charging my lipo batteries.
R2O3YUPITL591M,well built  very happy with the item
R36PT1GXLT247E,bought this and have to say it rapidly is becoming one of my favorite duel decks.
R36PT1GXLT247E,i chose eldrazi  my hubs picked zendikar.
R36PT1GXLT247E,we are decent magic players and so far we are dead even for winslosses on our picks.both decks need a good set of drops  and once that happens its a steamroller situation.
R36PT1GXLT247E,there feels to be a good balance between the two  tho i think eldrazi is the stronger deck.
R36PT1GXLT247E,using spawn as land to cast is a great mechanic that churns out the creatures and helps with lowcost blockers.great cards.
R36PT1GXLT247E,fun mechanics.
R36PT1GXLT247E,really interesting to play.
R36PT1GXLT247E,winner in my book.
R1QN47T9CXVW4,"this is my first product like this, i bought after i did some research and weighed a few other options, and im glad i did."
R1QN47T9CXVW4,the price was right for the variety of colors you get.
R1QN47T9CXVW4,"it is tricky to get the hang of, the amount of water needed for it is really very little, but it also depends on what method of application is used."
R1QN47T9CXVW4,get this and have fun!
R1QN47T9CXVW4,it just takes a bit of experimenting to get the colors as opaque or sheer as youd like and to blend colors.
R1QN47T9CXVW4,i have bright red hair and have used it with a small angled eyeliner brush to get beautifully bold orange and red eyebrows to match that last all day and night.
R1QN47T9CXVW4,ive also filled in tattoos for a fun pop of color and used it for super bright lips.
R1QN47T9CXVW4,it does come with two decent little brushes so thats a plus.
R1QN47T9CXVW4,i use either a beauty blender or cheap wedge sponges for bigger areas.
R1QN47T9CXVW4,remember to thoroughly wash your brushes  sponges with soap and water because this stuff is very pigmented!
R1I335AU6REEYA,i really wish id listened to all of the negative reviews.
R1I335AU6REEYA,"im a volunteer at a primary school clinic, and our kids are dropping baby teeth like crazyat lunch, in their classrooms, and even in the hall right outside the clinic."
R1I335AU6REEYA,"we started out the school year two weeks ago with 30 tooth holders, and now were down to about 5. amazon.com to the rescue!"
R1I335AU6REEYA,"well, not quite....i received my well packaged, well padded box containing the mini tooth chests within the 2day prime shipment estimate, which is good since were in a bit of a pinch."
R1I335AU6REEYA,"the bag contained 3 colors of chestspurple, pink, and orange."
R1I335AU6REEYA,"it would have been nice to get additional colors such as the ones in the photo, but at this point im not picky we just need something that will safely store those bloody baby teeth so the kids can take them home and let the tooth fairy do the rest."
R1I335AU6REEYA,"having read a few of the negative reviews, i realized that i needed to test the chests before i brought them to school."
R1I335AU6REEYA,the first pink chest closed just fine.
R1I335AU6REEYA,the next one was was missing a tab that secures the &34lock&34it didnt stay closed.
R1I335AU6REEYA,"a third purple chest was missing a tab, so of course that one wouldnt stay closed."
R1I335AU6REEYA,"i tested 20 of these chests, and only 6 would stay closed."
R1I335AU6REEYA,"after some quick calculating i realized that out of 144 chests, there probably were only around 40 that would stay closed."
R1I335AU6REEYA,"sorry for the language, but that is some p$$poor quality control, and i am not a happy customer.ive started the return process stating that these chests were &34defective&34hopefully i will get my $$ back so i can order tooth holders that will actually perform the job as described."
R13M29KCUX645Q,gave as a gift  child loved it!
R2NUAQGAX7B98E,very easy to fly indoors
R2KZINRDRHQEM7,"i bought one of these a few weeks ago, and i liked it well enough to buy another one."
R2KZINRDRHQEM7,"great quality, great performance."
R2KZINRDRHQEM7,"i have all sorts of uses for these batteries, and will probably buy more."
R2X3PTV1RIBM99,"very elegant clawdeen, thank you!"
R2GS3UUEWTEOU4,nice
RZKBDNKZ377H0,bought this for a 3 yr old for his birthday and it was a huge hit.
RZKBDNKZ377H0,it was the first present he opened and he immediately forgot about the rest of his presents and played with it for 2 hours straight!
RZKBDNKZ377H0,"i had wanted to see if it would be good for my 2 year old, so i will be buying another one shortly for him."
RZKBDNKZ377H0,"the lights, siren sounds, movement forward and backward was just so exciting for them."
RZKBDNKZ377H0,and its a good size for toddlerspreschoolers.
RZKBDNKZ377H0,highly recommend!the only con is that it is loud!
RZKBDNKZ377H0,but all these trucks wsounds are.
RZKBDNKZ377H0,it would be great if they had a lower volume setting...
R36PX7BZ2CWJMM,"easy to erect, far exceeded all expectations"
R2BS5DPM7V4CKQ,this product is excellent.
R2BS5DPM7V4CKQ,it took about 30 minutes to put it together.
R2BS5DPM7V4CKQ,the instructions were mostly clear.
R2BS5DPM7V4CKQ,it fit together well for the lowest set of holes for my 4 and 6 year old grandsons.
R2BS5DPM7V4CKQ,you can write on the chalkboard without any preparation  maybe the product has been improved since the older reviews that mentioned a problem here.
R2BS5DPM7V4CKQ,my grandsons took to it right away and we played with it for a while at the first use.
R2BS5DPM7V4CKQ,we bought the accessory set also  it was of fine quality.
R1N7786OAOSP61,my daughter has been playing with this for over a year now she has learned to walk with it and still plays with it daily at almost 2 ... great toy
RDCXHZZHAL3BQ,we had a lot of fun with this game at home with eh fam
R2XK6BBR04ZVP3,beautifully painted and realistic model.
R2XK6BBR04ZVP3,"amazing detail, particularly the interior of the mouth."
R2XK6BBR04ZVP3,highly recommended.
R1FEGDG8INSG32,"instructions were clear, but the general structure of the whole thing lacks stability."
R1FEGDG8INSG32,"the screw just dropped out of the pendulum base, two of the medium axles were smaller in diameter than the rest, so some wobbling, and that whopping long pendulum stalk is of no use the dowelling warps easily due to its length, and it just &34sways&34 back & forth in a circular motion.... lacking stability.... would be better having a doubledowelled pendulum."
R1FEGDG8INSG32,"the face plate does not fit correctly, and pushes various gears together.... hence the clock ticks for about 30 seconds, then stops.i think the instructions give you plenty warning about it not working for various reasons.... perhaps this is a cover for the lack of stability."
R1FEGDG8INSG32,"anyway, learnt the hard way!"
R2RQSB20GQLAIG,this board seemed like a great idea when i saw it so i decided to give it a shot.
R2RQSB20GQLAIG,it is of good construction and looks pretty cool.
R2RQSB20GQLAIG,the problem is it seems that you need to be an experienced skate boarder to get any good use out of it.
R2RQSB20GQLAIG,"i have young kids and thought they might enjoy playing with it, working on their balance and pushing each other around."
R2RQSB20GQLAIG,well it lasted a few hours.
R2RQSB20GQLAIG,they are unable to balance on it and it doesnt slide around nearly as well as i expected.
R2RQSB20GQLAIG,unfortunately it has ended with the other unused toys the kids have.
R2RQSB20GQLAIG,make sure you are getting this for the proper person or that you have good boarding experience.
R1FK31PV071I1F,"good play tool for boys, the noise level if fine and it is easy for little hands and fingers to manage."
RE7VVWC6SHBXR,it works fine.
RE7VVWC6SHBXR,i bought it for my daughter to put in her classroom.
RE7VVWC6SHBXR,"she has an avengers theme for the second year, the kids love it."
R39JERTV9WO2DN,keeps kids busy and doesnt need to be charged up!
R1THX9JAKJKRWV,gift for the groom.
R1THX9JAKJKRWV,he loved them.
R2PQM73T0S5EMR,they do not fill up very much.
R2PQM73T0S5EMR,this means that they bounce off when thrown.
R2PQM73T0S5EMR,the next time i filled up a couple hundred i filled & had dinner.
R2PQM73T0S5EMR,came bout & almost all of them had leaked out.
R2PQM73T0S5EMR,"not very happy kids.i would not purchase this item again, or recommend anyone."
R2PQM73T0S5EMR,is there a rating that can be chosen that is less than 1 star??
R2PQM73T0S5EMR,?
RCTRVUUH9YNAQ,used for dock party  great colors
R17DK3YUN3WEL8,"this is a great toy, but dont believe that it will really teach your kids about electronics."
R17DK3YUN3WEL8,my son has had this for about 5 years but it mostly sit in the box.
R17DK3YUN3WEL8,hes 15 now and we got it out last night.
R17DK3YUN3WEL8,"its easy for him to follow the directions but you dont really learn that much about electronics because all of the integrated circuit ic modules are like little ""black boxes"" in that you dont know their inputs and outputs."
R17DK3YUN3WEL8,so the only real learning the ive ever been able to do with him with this is to talk a bit about resistors and parallel vs. serial circuits.
R17DK3YUN3WEL8,"otherwise, youre kinda stuck with the ""recipe"" they give you."
R17DK3YUN3WEL8,if youre luck you can modify it slightly and do cool stuff.
R3BF8NDUFQMU6O,awesome product.
R3BF8NDUFQMU6O,kid loved saving george from the fiery candles .
RPM7IPJYJSA1H,great!
RPM7IPJYJSA1H,thanks.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,this is an amazing slide for my almost 14 month old son.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,we got this for his 1st birthday and he is always playing with it in his room.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,"we would go outside with it but someone might steal it live in a bad apartment complex, people steal all the time."
R25VG81AVWH3HI,it is a light toy so you might want to hold onto one side while your child climbs up.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,we really havent had any trouble with it falling over when my son climbs on it.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,he is 2 and a half feet tall and 31 pounds.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,this has helped him learn how to climb and he loves using the climbing wall.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,he also likes to try to go up the slide.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,silly boy.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,this was also very easy to put together.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,we love this slide!ps... i dont know why the pictures are sideways.
R25VG81AVWH3HI,sorry!
R2N02L5SIMEHKP,my granddaughter is thrilled with this gift.
R2N02L5SIMEHKP,cheapest price also.
R1YJFSYT98ZTFE,what a piece of garbage.
R1YJFSYT98ZTFE,the fins are part of a foam sleeve that was ripped in half before i opened the box.
R1YJFSYT98ZTFE,i rigged it with some rubberbands.
R1YJFSYT98ZTFE,then the launch tube is full of holes which is a great idea for making sure the vinegar and baking soda mix except there are holes in it so there is no way to fill it with baking soda.
R1YJFSYT98ZTFE,the baking soda just falls out as fast as you fill it.
R1YJFSYT98ZTFE,this thing is a total scam.
R1M4HGS1FVN6JL,beautiful cars.

R1573MURTMSOOM,what a great idea it was to make a little play kitchen out of a stool!
R1573MURTMSOOM,this toy is really awesome as it is a kitchen and a step stool and a chair.
R1573MURTMSOOM,your little girl will sure love it.
R1573MURTMSOOM,everything fits very neatly inside so the clean up is easy.
R1573MURTMSOOM,if only the clean up at the real kitchen was so easy!
R1573MURTMSOOM,it has some decals that were easy to apply.
R1573MURTMSOOM,"youll need 2 aa batteries for this toy the burners light up and sizzle so adorably!this kitchen comes with very cute silverware, pots, pans, cups, fruits, vegetables, and eggs."
R1573MURTMSOOM,"you can take a whole egg, pretend to break it, and then fry it as it comes with a sunny side up egg too  this step stoolkitchen is made out of sturdy plastic so it is safe for your little one to step on it."
R1573MURTMSOOM,this would make a perfect gift for every little girl or boy out there.
R1573MURTMSOOM,i received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes.
R10NJWNBMAMZ8Y,these are greati really wish they sold 2 opposite angles herethey all kinda curve in one direction so when you have 2 next to each other they have to be set in place in the same direction or they look wonkyi like my pins to face inward so i can pull straight out instead of working my fingers in between the 2 terminalswhen they are in the same direction it looks out of balance not symmetrical so it seems like this is half of what you need to buy yet i dont see any others for sale
R3FMCQJP5DMOUT,detail but prices is a bit high.
R1U6IHZVANN67V,cute learning game!
R1U6IHZVANN67V,my kids love it
RIGCRJ5CFFP9X,"upon unboxing, everything was intact and well packed against breakage."
RIGCRJ5CFFP9X,"light worked great, better at night of course."
RIGCRJ5CFFP9X,"i intend on using this on trick or treat night and with that being said, great product for the minimal use it will get."
RIGCRJ5CFFP9X,"also, for the price, dont expect high end material in this light, it is built well though."
RIGCRJ5CFFP9X,"in closing, a better light replacement method would be great."
R258KXD1P4RQS3,"easy to inflate, allows an adult to sit in comfortably, can easily tie it to an anchor."

R3U825Y718QR00,bows dont stay on to well
R11XKMRNQNNN10,these are just plastic.
R11XKMRNQNNN10,"if theres any sort of glass fiber in there, i cant see it."
R11XKMRNQNNN10,"when you break a carbon fiber prop, you can see the layers of fiber criss crossed in there, but with these they have the same consistency the whole way through."
R11XKMRNQNNN10,"they are fine if you dont crash, but they seem to hold up well enough even if you do."
R11XKMRNQNNN10,"if they hit anything hard its basically guaranteed to break, but in my case i crash mostly in grass so they tend to last through a few crashes.these are just ok for flying."
R11XKMRNQNNN10,"if youve never used carbon fiber props and only used these then you are missing out because cf flies much smoother, but in a pinch these will do.mine didnt come with the spacers or adapters or whatever they are but thats ok i didnt need them anyways."
R3NOYF30T3AGA7,as usual playmobil is a great quality product.

R3SKT75U7WTCC7,"this doesnt work  i bought this thinking that a small version of this type of bubble blower would work best for short e.g., childs arms but we didnt succeed in getting bubbles."
R3SKT75U7WTCC7,"thinking it might have been the bubble solution which was indeed part of the issue  this solution didnt provide decent bubbles in other swordstyle blower, emptied and refilled with solution known to work well  managed one bubble and then nothing after that."
R3SKT75U7WTCC7,"sorry, folks, spend the bigger bucks and be happy  we have the unbelievable bubble bought at same time as this one and are much much happier with it especially when used with the bubble solution that came with it ... wish it came with more!!."
R3SKT75U7WTCC7,we used the unbelievable bubble first so we knew how to use the device.
R9C7JUNGHM6F5,"this blows a lot of bubbles, which is great, but it is surprisingly noisy, and it is hard not to spill the solution if you need to move the machine."
R9C7JUNGHM6F5,"there is no cap to it, so if you dont use up all the solution, youre kind of stuck."
R36Y1630E2O1JM,went on wall great but not so great taking them off.

R2VU5PV8UJQHY7,"like many, i am related to a 2nd grader who is obsessed with shopkins."
R2VU5PV8UJQHY7,"as an adult, i dont completely understand why, but im sure i collected a few head scratchers back when i was a 2nd grader."
R2VU5PV8UJQHY7,"on the positive end, this shopkins fashion spree shoe dazzle playset makes a nice display for your shopkins, shoe related or otherwise."
R2VU5PV8UJQHY7,"while this set doesnt come with many shopkins of its own, it does come with two."
R2VU5PV8UJQHY7,"if you are buying this for someone who doesnt have many shopkins, you may want to consider getting some extras to go with this playset."
R2VU5PV8UJQHY7,its not poorly made and our kid testor seems to love it.
R2VU5PV8UJQHY7,"so, all in all, that makes a win in my book."

R39YPKDZ3Z3KFN,ok
RLZR412X1765H,building blocks have been around for ages.
RLZR412X1765H,many companies have tried their hand at this classic toy and the fundamentals have remained the same stacking blocks that connectfit together.
RLZR412X1765H,then you have these.
RLZR412X1765H,"first of all, the blocks are oddly shaped."
RLZR412X1765H,theyre very rounded along the edges and they taper up so the bottoms are wider than the tops.
RLZR412X1765H,"the underside is simplistic when compared to a lego product, being that there isnt a specific channel for each &34bump&34 to connect into."
RLZR412X1765H,"when stacking like blocks two bump to two bump, four bump to four bump, etc."
RLZR412X1765H,they connect alright enough.
RLZR412X1765H,but dont try to &34bridge&34 two pieces together with a smaller piece on top as it merely sits on top of the bottom blocks and does not press into place at all.also worth noting is that the color distribution varies from that in the stock photo.
RLZR412X1765H,"in the set i received the pitched pieces are blue, the 4 bump blocks are green, larger blocks are orange, and 2 bump blocks are yellow.weve been really impressed with green toys and i had no reason to believe this product would be any exception."
RLZR412X1765H,sadly i was mistaken.
RLZR412X1765H,"the build of these is on par with green toys thick, sturdy and smooth plastic but they totally missed the mark on design."
RLZR412X1765H,"i would not purchase any more of these, especially given the high price point for 18 blocks."
RLZR412X1765H,sadly i cannot recommend these as theyre more frustrating than anything else.
R1URSR0ISNCOFP,"again another gorgeous version of frankie, keep it up she looks better and better with each doll!"
R1URSR0ISNCOFP,thanks!
R3TNAENAP1KYI0,card looked amazing and is already in my deck!

R10BZSFTYOWA0I,excellent
R2PNB3NNG6PCIB,i bought the product tomorrow and have enjoyed it immensely
RL8JBJN4GI9FY,my 12 year old sister liked the blaster.
RL8JBJN4GI9FY,"she tried my demolisher and had a hard time with it, maybe a little big for her, but she got the hang of this blaster pretty easy, i got shot a few times by it."
RL8JBJN4GI9FY,"kinda stings, but thats okay."
RL8JBJN4GI9FY,"she unloaded the clip on me pretty quick, considering its a fly wheel blaster battery operated."
RL8JBJN4GI9FY,"as long as my sister likes it and is happy with it, thats all that matters."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,wrath of the righteous wotr is a table top game that uses a combination of cards and dice to create a high fantasy adventure for 1  4 players more if you have the character expansion pack.
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,the game is cooperative  all players work together to achieve each game scenarios goal.
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"everything you need to play is in this one box dice, cards, rules, though expansions and various accessories are also available."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"the game itself is a hybrid of both traditional board games and roleplaying games rpgs  shuffled cards determine what treasure you will find and monsters you will face, and your character becomes stronger after every scenario as heshe battles the hordes of darkness."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"no game master gm is required, though a moderate amount of setup and takedown time is necessary for each scenario.wrath of the righteous is relatively easy to learn to play, but will require some reading of the rulebook in order to properly understand."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,each player controls a different character with special abilities and equipment represented by cards.
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"characters take turns searching locations and dealing with what they discover  be it monsters, treasure, or horrible villains."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"cards are played to represent what the character does or uses, and dice rolls determining success or failure.in my opinion, the pathfinder adventure card game acg is incredibly fun, and wrath of the righteous is one of the most enjoyable sets so far."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"wotr allows a high fantasy adventure experience whenever a player wants it, without the need for a willing gm or an exact group of friends to properly play."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"i still love traditional roleplaying games along with their flexibility and potential for incredible story experiences, but this acg is also a great deal of fun  i highly recommend it.rating 4.5 out of 5 stars rounded to 5. an incredible game for those looking for high fantasy adventure."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"does require some setup and takedown time, as well as a decent understanding of the rulebook.tip do not mark the cards in this set."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"either print a character sheet and mark it to track character progress, or purchase card sleeves and then mark on them with a felttip ink pen the sleeve goes over the card, but can be removed when you want to play the character over."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"sleeve size will most likely be standard card game sleeve size, though this can vary slightly by manufacturer.accessories and expansions wotr and the other pacgs have a number of accessories and expansions available for them  everything from new adventures called &34wrath of the righteous adventure deck&34 and the number to miniatures that represent the characters and contain unique cards &34pathfinder iconic heroes&34."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"none of these things are necessary for new players to have, and may even create unnecessary confusion."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"for those people that really want to start with a more complete pacg experience, however, i would recommend two possible purchases the wrath of the righteous character addon deck $20 or less retail on release and the pathfinder adventure card game mat retailing at roughly $25$30 on release."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"the character addon deck provides more characters for players to choose from the play mat makes it easier to figure out where cards should be placed, and helps prevent them from sliding not to mention making the game look more organized and appealing, imo."
R1TJPWT03U7MFN,"these accessoriesexpansions are nice to have, but not necessary to enjoy the game especially when first purchased."
R27CHLD33TXTX0,i purchased this for my 6 year old on his birthday and he loved that it has a bed.

R208TW4Q6NU5KF,kids enjoyed putting it together but it falls apart.
R208TW4Q6NU5KF,not sturdy at all.
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,"even though i am not a child, i am lucky to have two granddaughters, 9 and 15 years old, to share this telescope with."
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,"i have very little experience with telescopes, although i am very familiar with other optical instruments microscopesoptical test equipment."
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,where i am a complete newbie is in locating stars and planets  ill be lucky to find the moon!
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,but i am beyond excited to learn and have signed up for a beginners astronomy course.
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,"i have also downloaded an app called star walk 2 on my ipad, which will hopefully help me to identify what we see in the sky.the telescope came in a huge package in perfect condition."
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,"it took me about 30 minutes to put it together, the directions were clear and i did not need any tools."
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,"everything is sturdy, stable and very well made."
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,the telescope was larger and more impressive looking than i had imagined it would be.
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,"several lenses are included, and a nice booklet which clearly explains how to start.i dont live in a place where it gets super dark at night, due to lights from a nearby city."
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,"however, we own a rural property where there is some open sky available, and this is where we will be having stargazing nights.i live in the tampa bay area of florida, and since it is our rainy season, it has rained and been cloudy every single evening for the past two months, and there is more rain on the way."
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,"we will have to wait until we have a clear night to find some extraterrestrial objects.i am really happy to have this telescope, and i am impatiently waiting to venture outside with it.as a gift for a child i think this would be fantastic!"
R3QKRSNQYDXWC2,"it is not at all toylike, its quality is high, and i cant think of a better gift for a fledgling astronomer."

R2V3UU04B02N93,"5 star fun, 4 star quality."
R2V3UU04B02N93,i have flown these helicopters for several years with my son.
R2V3UU04B02N93,i would say its the perfect step up from like the syma s107.
R2V3UU04B02N93,"the micro size is very durable for high speed crashes, however it makes the copter nearly unflyable outside in the wind.the pluses great for the price, parts are cheap you can buy any part."
R2V3UU04B02N93,good power and a quality controller.
R2V3UU04B02N93,"easy to fly  with practice, and i still crash a lot."
R2V3UU04B02N93,only the faster crashes will cause possible damage.negatives when you receive this heli glue the tail motor mount down to the boom!
R2V3UU04B02N93,if you crash tail first into the wall the mount will slide forward and shear the wires off yes i did it before.
R2V3UU04B02N93,"i wish the quality of motor was better, the one you see i replaced both motors, it is the oldest heli i have however i have 3. the amount of plastic in the rotor causes the flight characteristics to change and frequent trimming."
R2V3UU04B02N93,the drive gear will be ruined quickly without killing the power before a crash.tips glue the tail motor mount down.
R2V3UU04B02N93,kill the power before a crash and dont let it flop around on the floor.
R2V3UU04B02N93,i would say 67 years old to fly this without destroying it.
R2V3UU04B02N93,"i would order main drive gears, balance bars and main blades."
R2V3UU04B02N93,i have not broken the tail blades yet.
R2V3UU04B02N93,there are great kits with everything besides the motors for around $10 including all the usual broken parts plus a new canopy and skids.
R2V3UU04B02N93,the main drive gear i had to order individually.
R2V3UU04B02N93,"dont overhead the motors too badly, they may begin to turn slowly and have to be replaced, warm not hot.have fun!"
R2J0BUUUKJNEKG,nice and big for kids to ride on.
R2J0BUUUKJNEKG,once on its steady but can be tricky to get on.
R2J0BUUUKJNEKG,my kids love it!
R2J0BUUUKJNEKG,we like the realistic details on it.
RAA38310WMFA2,ive wanted a decent prowl for years since i got back into transformers and i missed the generations prowl and passed on the prime kit bashed prowl.
RAA38310WMFA2,time was on my side it looks like.
RAA38310WMFA2,i personally love this figure and had to pick him up the moment i saw him.prowl is loaded with articulation and comes with a tribarreled rifle and the handfoot piece for the giant combinor.
RAA38310WMFA2,"i wasnt looking to complete all 5, but i might now."
RAA38310WMFA2,"prowl alone puts all my cons from bruticus to shame.the detailing is alreay pretty nice, but im thinking of lining it with a black paint pen to bring out more of the detail.the comic doesnt feature much of prowl though."
RAA38310WMFA2,that seems to be a habit with hasbro now.
RAA38310WMFA2,"oh well.you see prowl, get him."
RAA38310WMFA2,you wont be disappointed.
R2I5GWS79E4AQM,"very happy with quality,performance and ease of use , confident it will perform for a long time ."
R2I5GWS79E4AQM,so far so good .
R3VNCZYTE3L92E,"very fragileafter the first crash my son had, the front plastic piece came off."
R2LCFU5W7AFOF5,my niece was elated when she got this barbie!
R2LCFU5W7AFOF5,packaging was superb for a birthday gift too.
R14C5CEK75HJYX,i have yet to be disappointed with a green toys item
R3K8WBXDO33HNN,my 16 year old daughter loved this present!!
R3K8WBXDO33HNN,she was able to look at numerous objects and enjoys it.
R3A548C8GVTNMB,bought this for my grandson and he loves it but if he didnt id give this a 12 star rating.
R3A548C8GVTNMB,"very cheap quality, feels like hollow light weight plastic."
RJTE957HDA1SQ,great dress.
RJTE957HDA1SQ,"has been washed multiple times, and still remains intact."
RJTE957HDA1SQ,my niece absolutely adores it and i think she actually wore it on a daily basis for at least a month.
R3LFFM5PW88WJG,very pretty

RJ0PR0S61EDLM,bonita
R3BE9Q3FNVC0UV,just what i was looking for
R35RR3635AW576,we had one of these before and it stopped working after years.
R35RR3635AW576,this is a great product.
R3NWEEHBI7H86F,so soft!
R3NWEEHBI7H86F,came before expected.
R1YJX1JTUJ4UU0,"well, the picture is deceiving as this item is at least 50 pink and while my grandsons arent weird about pink things, i still would have liked to get what i see on the listing and so found this transaction to be somewhat dissatisfying from the getgo!"
R3NNY8ANJCAROK,bought this and several others for positive reinforcement for my son to use the potty.
R3NNY8ANJCAROK,it has worked wonders.
R2M1FGJ7O0R9BV,kids love
RMO8EGUF5ZUQT,wildly adorable.
RMO8EGUF5ZUQT,my daughter really wants to be a leopard for halloween and this outfit is perfect.
RMO8EGUF5ZUQT,she can layer underneath and she will be warm.
RMO8EGUF5ZUQT,"it could be a little longer, but we will get by."
RMO8EGUF5ZUQT,"if your child is tall, these will be too short."
RMO8EGUF5ZUQT,"my daughter is 3yo, 28 lbs and 36 inches tall."
RDZ2QFHYTM098,just who i was looking for this guy is so cool looking i want one on my side of the field
R2N5386358C685,"very nicely made, children will love it."

R9MEU146QT2D3,nice bank.
R9MEU146QT2D3,my son loves it.
R9MEU146QT2D3,holds a fair amount of coins.
R26XVFTL19U97M,it is pretty much what i thought it would be a cheap toy for grown ups.
R26XVFTL19U97M,my sister did like it alright.
R1LTJO73T6AN5,we really enjoy this game and it is impossible to find in stores anymore.
R1LTJO73T6AN5,loads of fun and great for younger children too.
R202R8JI5XQLRJ,"this charger comes from china, so it takes a few weeks for delivery."
R202R8JI5XQLRJ,"the charger is better then i thought it would be, very good quality, i recommend this battery charger."
R19VWBPLD5L2DN,great thanks
R1VE9A4BI27VOS,this puzzle was an immediate hit with my son who is almost a year old.
R1VE9A4BI27VOS,as soon as he grabbed the first piece it was ruined within minutes because he put it in his mouth which is a normal development stage for 12 month olds.
R1VE9A4BI27VOS,the animals are just stickers on top not painted on and any moisture causes them to peeldissolve immediately.
R1VE9A4BI27VOS,im so disappointed to have waste money on this.
R1VE9A4BI27VOS,its also disappointing that it appears all m & d toys are being made in china.
R1VE9A4BI27VOS,"no thanks, i rather buy quality toys like haba and hape where i trust their standards and safety."
RGP7XGXWBXRKJ,i am more than pleased with the neon hats.
RGP7XGXWBXRKJ,"i am going to use them as decorations for my ""fun hat party on friday."
RGP7XGXWBXRKJ,just the right touch!
R36H5ZBIE9LYSR,cheaply made.
R36H5ZBIE9LYSR,just ugly quality.
R36H5ZBIE9LYSR,ill be finding my daughter a different costume.
R36H5ZBIE9LYSR,sad to see something disney made so cheap.
R1GQQ8ZF8OFW9F,love the storage at the bottom!
R17N3EGW5PXR2A,love it
R157XKKBHCCM87,"i did enjoy the star patterns until the bulb burned out, which was only a few days."
R157XKKBHCCM87,the star wars galaxy was actually very interesting but just too bright to keep on beyond an initial view.
R157XKKBHCCM87,"the case redeems the product, very cool!"
R157XKKBHCCM87,i have since graduated to the star theater pro which costs quite a bit more money and that is nothing short of awesome and seems to be durable.
R157XKKBHCCM87,"this is more a childs toy with a few redeeming features for ""big"" kids."
R1SRFL6724FD9H,great price and perfect for a 2 year old to doodle on.
R1SRFL6724FD9H,just hoping he understands that you cant write on just any table.
R3CYTOCDA6CFU3,ive still run into this model from time to time retail in 2015 but she is of course getting more difficult to locate.
R3CYTOCDA6CFU3,i doubt mattel will rerelease this one any time soon so if you can find it online for a good price i would snag it.
R3CYTOCDA6CFU3,"that being said, the model has the obvious flaw of not actually having the rear spoiler as portrayed in the movie and on the packaging."
R3CYTOCDA6CFU3,"pretty disappointing to my son, but he quickly forgot about it."
R3CYTOCDA6CFU3,"its still a quality unit and the wings have been solid under heavy play, this has been one of the few cars with ""extra"" parts that hasnt hit my workbench for some superglue or homeengineering fix."
R1JB9KB49OA1O8,"simple, fun, but kids lose interest in them pretty soon."
R1JB9KB49OA1O8,at least that was the case with out little one.
R1JB9KB49OA1O8,so this comment is pretty subjective in nature.
R1JB9KB49OA1O8,other parents may find otherwise.
R1JB9KB49OA1O8,"but as a whole, pretty nice, sturdy, and easy to clean."
R2F4C7WQOQ0U9T,is day 23 and the horses have finally acceped me as one of their own.
R2F4C7WQOQ0U9T,i now know all their secrets.
R2F4C7WQOQ0U9T,i know information nobody shall ever know.
R2F4C7WQOQ0U9T,their plans shall remain secret until i report back to headquarters.
R24X8F1G0D14X1,did not have the uspcc stamp.
R24X8F1G0D14X1,and not a trick deck even though it says it in description.
R3I40ADRW3C6D3,this is very cute.
R3I40ADRW3C6D3,"i was hoping to fit 2 water bottles in the bottom compartment like the last one we had, but unfortunately the bottom compartment is about the size of a sandwich."
R3I40ADRW3C6D3,my daughter completely loves it so we will make it work!!!!
R3I40ADRW3C6D3,!
ROBWIJGKYRVO3,having had purchased 2 other smart gear balance bikes over the year.
ROBWIJGKYRVO3,this current bike is poorly made and cheap.
RBG2BTGBMQFJ6,it is rare that a toy made today is superior to the same toy i played with as a boy 40 years ago.
RBG2BTGBMQFJ6,these army men are one of those cases.
RBG2BTGBMQFJ6,"better plastic, better details in the moulding, more poses."
RBG2BTGBMQFJ6,this was a good purchase.
RBG2BTGBMQFJ6,and the violent aspect of it...allowed us to talk to our two young sons about the ethical issues surrounding war.
R39004BIHZPTQ4,great product!
R39004BIHZPTQ4,very good price!!

R3MSWPKHVP3JMA,life like.
R27JA3HW5WJEF9,my son was so excited and its keeping him busy for hours.
R1WKAV28Z8M98G,these things broke the first day.
R1WKAV28Z8M98G,not good quality.
R1WKAV28Z8M98G,i should have gone to the dollar store & got the other ones.
R2UOA3HIN7EC3M,im a big twd fan.
R2UOA3HIN7EC3M,this and others is a must have.
R2UOA3HIN7EC3M,i like cooooral!

R3GYH97MPGWCG1,"lovely diary, bought for my granddaughter"
R2TZ915H9ZSOO3,works as expected.
R2TZ915H9ZSOO3,"there are two pieces in this kit, but depending on your traxxas model, you will only use one of the brackets in this kit."
R1QGTRVICV050U,i used this in a decorative wreath turned out so cute.
R1QGTRVICV050U,excellent product only wish i could get more.
R1U510M32YO757,the water balloons fill up as advertised and it is a cool concept.
R1U510M32YO757,unfortunately the rubber band ties do not hold water in balloons.
R1U510M32YO757,and 80 plus are already deflated.
R1U510M32YO757,if you are in possession i recommend hand tying each balloon after it is filled.
R1U510M32YO757,which defeats the purpose of this product.
R1U510M32YO757,photo shows what remains of th 148 balloons.
R33PR0X94BOQZI,excelent
R3R65DE53O1FJR,very nice but cute

R1X2NQFEFZ6HX2,cute.
R2HB3H0K4HGCK0,a product for the original builders of railroads.
R2HB3H0K4HGCK0,"i wish i could get this product but since it is for 275 years and up i am afraid i am still too young, it seems to me that this is a great item though."
R2HB3H0K4HGCK0,i know that my great great great grandpa will enjoy this very much.
R3JU3CCG7UAT3K,slinkys are awesome.
R3JU3CCG7UAT3K,so much fun.
R3SWHB7ICTDCS1,very happy!
R3SWHB7ICTDCS1,i bought this for my niece and was very happy with its appearance and quality.
R3SWHB7ICTDCS1,sturdy and looks a lot more expensive than what i paid.
R3SWHB7ICTDCS1,about to order another one for a friend.
RVKYD0RBF2577,"my kids were begging me to get this all summer long... i finally got it for them, as this company offered me a discount in exchange for an honest review.the kids loved it so much!obviously the great advantage of this is that you literally fill up a bunch of balloons in less than a minute!"
RVKYD0RBF2577,there are little bands on the balloons so you dont have to tie them.it kept the kids busy for a while and they had such a great time!definitely a must for the summer months!
R35CB7ZFS1D4IO,"i love the pack, a lot of colors, really love them!"
RPBLUY4LWNC1A,great
R31U0RD8QY0TDM,great detail and conformation on this model.
R31U0RD8QY0TDM,"if you happen to get a collecta with a slightly bent leg after shipping, a little heat via lowlevel heat gun, blow dryer, boiling water will straighten it out."
R31U0RD8QY0TDM,"he does have delicate legs but once set, ive had no problems with bowing again."
RWPHWFYTVVWU4,nice
R2TKSQ8SIQ7TJQ,came in perfect condition
R7FW2CEWTBV59,too hard for an eight year old.
RP1XQ205AY2FA,cute chair.
RP1XQ205AY2FA,assembling it went well until the last arm was to be put into place.
RP1XQ205AY2FA,it did not fit and came unglued from the small block of wood.
RP1XQ205AY2FA,i had to secure it with a screw.
RP1XQ205AY2FA,doesnt look the best but at least its together.
R1ROKE7JH31YHR,quality was not good.
R1ROKE7JH31YHR,they dont look like the real thing.
R15TKE25ZRHTP2,"great game, but not as good as when i was a child back then the board and the spaces were bigger, there were cards to draw the turn table is quite cheap."
R15TKE25ZRHTP2,i prefered the grafics of when i was a kid.
ROZ0F2W6ZOJA8,"removed the old, difficulttoclean shower mats from the guest shower, and put in these darling duckies."
ROZ0F2W6ZOJA8,"visitors love them, and enjoy the surprise of finding these safety stickers in the shower."
ROZ0F2W6ZOJA8,i bought three packages to do the 4 x 5 floor.
R28RYGT3DT1FZW,soon cute!!
R28RYGT3DT1FZW,love it!
R3QWN5S1IE0022,annoying that we would order something for our daughter to enjoy and it arrived torn.
R3QWN5S1IE0022,we can sew the tie back on but how disappointing.
R3QWN5S1IE0022,poor quality.
R2LGFC9Z6ANNDC,great
R1JOD25CHKN6JG,love it!
R15JBOBWN2T3Y0,great item.
R15JBOBWN2T3Y0,possibly the most detailed of all green lantern pop vinyl figures.
RF97JYOAANEC,my nineyear old daughter cannot get enough calico critters!
RF97JYOAANEC,i find them to be somewhat fragile for the amount of wear and tear they go through.
RF97JYOAANEC,"mainly, their fuzzy ""fur"" wears off with normal play."
RF97JYOAANEC,"kids love to take the clothes off and on, but some of the clothes, especially the babies, dont hold up well to repeated dressings."
RF97JYOAANEC,but i cannot say enough about the joy they bring to my kid!
RF97JYOAANEC,endless play.
R1HRS4CUK4ZJEY,you need at most an 8 inch mattress.
R1HRS4CUK4ZJEY,we didnt realize this and bought an 11 inch mattress that when put in the bed is higher than the bed sides.
R1HRS4CUK4ZJEY,there was nothing to protect my little guy from rolling off.
R1Z7ALJF41VZ58,purchased these last christmas.
R1Z7ALJF41VZ58,my son is still in love with his little people.
R1Z7ALJF41VZ58,one of his favorite toys to play with.
R1K5PX4DNAM15A,the magnet fit perfectly into my modern scalextric slot car.
R1K5PX4DNAM15A,easily inserts sideways intounder the tabs.
R3GQ24ARFMXE7L,its fun but play with a big group.
R24SIG1O5XHDAP,great.
R24SIG1O5XHDAP,held up in 22mph winds for about an hour.
R24SIG1O5XHDAP,handles are smooth.
R24SIG1O5XHDAP,when the entire 500ft are out it can take a while to wind back once done but the second time i used it i brought with me my power drill to assist.
R24SIG1O5XHDAP,the handle fits perfectly in standard power drill chuck for easy wind back on to the reel.
R24SIG1O5XHDAP,tip for those who will let out all the 500ft of this.
R24SIG1O5XHDAP,did not measure if was actually 500ft but i will trust the mtg of it to assume it is.
R3FC4PHGMFGUNT,excellent
R18M09PZIA6UR,everyone liked them.
R12JE69B51G0Q2,my grandson loves transformers and this is just one of the many that he has.
R1XVT68OA4X0J5,this was a gift for my preschoolelementary age grandsons.
R1XVT68OA4X0J5,they love it.
R1XVT68OA4X0J5,"parents do, too."
R1XVT68OA4X0J5,"easy clean up..you just put a wad of sand in your hand, wipe it over the scattered grains and they all stick together again."
R81X8T3NUR37N,i love this bear!!
R81X8T3NUR37N,"this bear is huge, soft and just awesome."
R81X8T3NUR37N,"my kids sit next to him on the couch and watch tv with the bear, it is the most adorable thing ever."
R81X8T3NUR37N,so glad i got this bear.
R3LSXXDT5JSGAM,good quality costume runs bit small!
R2MV9FKPCWRV6T,my two year old grandson loves this toy.
R2MV9FKPCWRV6T,he enjoys threading them as much as playing with them individually or stacking them.
R2MV9FKPCWRV6T,highly recommend this.
R2MV9FKPCWRV6T,i put it up for a rainy day and it made a bored toddler quiet and engrossed for awhile when he usually has the typical two year old attention span of a gnat.
R2MV9FKPCWRV6T,it is well made and the wooden tray is great for storing them on a shelf.
R10CEEOV36WKWR,unfortunately this was pretty much useless device.
R10CEEOV36WKWR,very disappointed!
R10CEEOV36WKWR,nice about the seller is that he offered to replace the device and he did..but still the second one is also doesnt fly and my son almost lost interest in flying devices.
R10CEEOV36WKWR,dont know why they even sell this.
R10CEEOV36WKWR,two stars for the seller courtesy otherwise its zero stars for the product.
R10CEEOV36WKWR,$30 wasted!
R120NBENT8R2SL,good.
R368CNY8N9ROCW,my daughter got a feather boa from the dollar store and took off the feathers.
R368CNY8N9ROCW,the 6 and 7 year olds played pin the feather on the angry birds.
R36Z4V15GZC63W,fabulous puzzle.
R36Z4V15GZC63W,"you need a strong light andor a magnifying glass, but you do not need  and shouldnt use  the box!"
R36Z4V15GZC63W,"okay, its not my place to tell you how to approach a puzzle, but... please dont use the box."
R36Z4V15GZC63W,"if you know any geography at all, you dont need it."
R36Z4V15GZC63W,"everything goes together clearly, and there are lots of hints in the pieces itself, even if you cant remember whether krakatoa is east of java or west."
R36Z4V15GZC63W,"the movie said, east."
R36Z4V15GZC63W,the movie was wrong.
R36Z4V15GZC63W,"i know that from the picture it looks tough, with great expanses of brown."
R36Z4V15GZC63W,"in reality, there are less than a couple of dozen pieces without some distinguishing feature that tells you at least the direction in which it faces."
R39CZP8L8ZB4V1,eyes washed away the second day we got it!
R14VMF5WW6GKMB,my 3 year old loves her new baby doll.
R14VMF5WW6GKMB,she takes it everywhere.
R14VMF5WW6GKMB,its the perfect size for her.

R1Y6MGB8IKZF1Q,"its so nice to her though, its become more like a collectible than art supplies."

R2QF8TTUTTD7M5,great product
RMKQQIT3YFIHN,the pattern is only on one side.

RMKQQIT3YFIHN,"the colors are nice and bright, though."
R2GCKJ6TC0414A,"nice petanque set, good quality in a wellmade carrying case."
RATYN9MQOEBKY,this doll is absolutely gorgeous.
RATYN9MQOEBKY,the box and graphics make an impressive presentation.
RATYN9MQOEBKY,the accessories included have a great amount of decorative details.
RATYN9MQOEBKY,"the clothing is well stitched, not basted."
RATYN9MQOEBKY,"and she seems to be constructed to last for quite some time cant say the same of some other dolls weve purchased recently from ""ever after"" which fell apart the first day."
RATYN9MQOEBKY,"most of the dolls we have gotten from other brands cannot be posed, or only move one or two ways with visible joints."
RATYN9MQOEBKY,these are exceptionally well done.

R1AOV25V1D8YW7,total rip off for that much money.
RHWVDH4EYGXYO,"very nice, and on time."
R3H0N180YZZD26,came exactly as how i would expect a bulk package of sleeves to come.no issues.
R2EDJ8G30ICVSG,this is such an adorable jelly cat.
R2EDJ8G30ICVSG,my daughter has been wanting this for a long time and she was so happy to get it.
R2EDJ8G30ICVSG,the coat comes off but the other accessories dont.
R2EDJ8G30ICVSG,but this doesnt bother her.
R2WBIC0TZAV31N,my 7yearold loved this toy.
R2WBIC0TZAV31N,we only played with it a few times at the fields near our house because it shoots really far.
R2WBIC0TZAV31N,"it was really fun, but the bow string got brittle and broke over the summer just sitting in her room."
R2WBIC0TZAV31N,"i, too, looked for a replacement string, but there are none."
R2WBIC0TZAV31N,she was really upset and now she is anxiously waiting to ask santa for a new one.
R2WBIC0TZAV31N,i will not be buying this brand again.
R2WBIC0TZAV31N,bummer.

R2DGEQGX0SJJ5B,i ordered two of the blind baskets.
R2DGEQGX0SJJ5B,i havent opened them because they are going to be either special gifts for doing a good deed or part of her christmas.
R2DGEQGX0SJJ5B,"i cant tell you the quality of the ones i ordered, but i can say that every shopkins product we have so far has been excellent quality."
R2DGEQGX0SJJ5B,the two baskets arrived with the plastic wrap fully intact and no damage to the packaging.
R2BRGXKS6ZJUL2,i bought the full chart for my kids but being that theyre different ages i needed different supplements.
R2BRGXKS6ZJUL2,"i give these packs a ""meh"" a lot of the items are repetitive, and i find it irritating that i had to buy two different packs just to make the chart work for ages 3 and 7. they would be doing well to make a family type pack that has stuff like ""do your home work"" then a few chores for little guys and a few chores for bigger guys."
R2BRGXKS6ZJUL2,i know you can write your own but i wanted the pictures for the little one to have something to equate with a star at his level.
R2BRGXKS6ZJUL2,over all though its a good system.
R2ALMCO54VR7CL,it accessorizes the kitchen perfectly!
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,clock is as advertised.
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,good build.
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,fine display.
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,one issue i observed though is that the player touch button on my clock is so sensitive that at one point while playing it keeps activating itself to start the other guys timer without being touched.
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,this happened severally during that game.
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,"although after switching off and on i havent noticed this again, i just hope it doesnt repeat itself as that would be a factory flaw.now on a second and personal note though, the reason i bought the clock was for scrabble and not for chess."
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,the manufacturer did a great job in including the scrabble mode of 25mins and negative countdown penalty at zero.
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,"however, some scrabble players dont play the full tournament 25mins game when playing casually or in clubs."
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,"also, certain tourneys not all advise 20mins play to save time for the whole games.this means that scrabble users want to be able to play a 15 or 20mins game with the negative countdown penalty feature as well when clock reaches zero."
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,"at present its only the scrabble mode that has that feature, and scrabble mode is compulsorily 25mins.if the makers can add this feature, market for his product from the scrabble community would soar as my fellow playmates are already loving the clock."
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,its not so common in the scrabble circles.
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,"this is personal though as the clock addresses all areas it advertised quite wellother than that, great clock."
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,nice to have.
R1UM18C1QVNRUM,and more affordable than the highend variants.
R2GGOEAFAFFQLO,"great crayola product, as usual!"
R2GGOEAFAFFQLO,these are the only markers i buy because they offer consistent results every time.

R2867HABX21RZM,fell apart the first day of use during my sons birthday party.
R2867HABX21RZM,my kids are 8 and 11.
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,"one of the most iconic vehicles in cinema history, ive always found the t.i.e."
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,fighter an inspired design.
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,"i never purchased any of the fine molds kits when they came out, although i really wanted to."
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,the detailing is as crisp as the very best japanese aircraft kits i own.
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,"i havent assembled it yet, but the fact that its a snaptogether kit, engineered to the highest quality is simply amazing."
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,"i saw a review on you tube for the 172 scale xwing kit & the reviewer said that there was no need of glue, or filler!"
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,thats astounding!
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,"i expect the same is true for most, if not all of these offerings."
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,"it is smaller than i would like..148 is my scale of choice for fighters, but a real gem nonetheless."
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,"my hope is that the sales warrant more 148 scale kits of the star wars fighters, however im very pleased with the results of bandai companys commitment to the star wars license."
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,well done!
R2TD8HWTXSQHYC,!
R2I63W1L3DFIID,whats not to love about the artwork on this thing?
R2I63W1L3DFIID,"its got an ape like face on the bonnet with a mouth with tongue and that little thing that hangs down the back of the throat, as well as very sharp teeth, the mouth also extends down both sides of the front of the vehicle."
R2I63W1L3DFIID,the car is a nice tan colour and also has black stripes which resemble hair on the back half of the sides.
R2I63W1L3DFIID,"it has an orange spare tyre, front bumper, plastic interior and even the undercarriage is also orange."
R2I63W1L3DFIID,the undercarriage is made of metal too.theres a few fragile parts of the car where plastic attachments meet the metal body.
R2I63W1L3DFIID,"such as the clear windshield, this is definitely something that can snap easily."
R2I63W1L3DFIID,the black roll bar in the back looks great but is also not something youd want to carry the car around by.
R2I63W1L3DFIID,the wheels are also pretty cheap but this was part of the 1995 mass produced budget line and the hubcaps do sort of match the colour of the body of the car.
R2I63W1L3DFIID,"its a pretty cool jeep like car, if you can find one for a couple of bucks online somewhere you should definitely get one."
RD00P7VJO1ZVR,just what i was looking for
R240WKNODUBCOD,very sturdy toy and the colors are so cute.
R240WKNODUBCOD,my daughter likes all the different moving parts and spends a lot of time playing in each of the rooms.

R240WKNODUBCOD,"once assembled, it is a little large so storing can be a problem."

R1B5JXYGVUV124,ok
R3C56X6ONU5CR1,used over and over.
R3C56X6ONU5CR1,good for little ones who dont really get coloring yet.
R3C56X6ONU5CR1,"colors form immediately when brush touches paper, and they like finding objects not initially visible."
R3C56X6ONU5CR1,rates right up there with stickers for most frequently requested craft.
R2AEK9F6HABLRS,this roller coaster is a big hit!
R2AEK9F6HABLRS,the little ones like it.
R2AEK9F6HABLRS,"they even run up the opposite side for fun,"
R3OWY570NHA1RC,the size came stained with some of the lead...
R2GPELU4TZW13Q,smaller than expected but as described.
R3I9LHIL92JB3F,i bought this plush for christmas last year.
R3I9LHIL92JB3F,"im not a very huge fan of flab&eacuteb&eacute or her evolutions, but this plush is beyond amazing."
R3I9LHIL92JB3F,"mine came very fast, but she came from a different seller though."
R3I9LHIL92JB3F,fairy type pok&eacutemon are one of my favorite types of pok&eacutemon next to water and psychic.this plush is adorable in many ways.
R3I9LHIL92JB3F,"her face is just uber kawaii, and her mouth resembles a beak, which is really cute."
R3I9LHIL92JB3F,this plush will make a perfect gift for fairy type pok&eacutemon fans!
R12BHLEAY5KB4X,"my 7 month old baby has no interest in it, which surprised me because she really likes balls."
R2CFOGCCP2LF8L,needed for a project.
R7C8N0LN4OCRJ,my 1.5 year old is just tall enough to sit and ride on this and its currently his favorite toy.
R7C8N0LN4OCRJ,we have bamboo floors so it glides easily.
R7C8N0LN4OCRJ,im not sure how well it would ride on carpet because it does seem to wobble slightly.
RB197OWAZ1PRN,its such a great game!
RB197OWAZ1PRN,i had a large group so we didnt even use the board.
RB197OWAZ1PRN,laughed all night.
R11LWVWHKL3DDI,this item has became mute after only two weeks.
R11LWVWHKL3DDI,"i didnt mind at all, but my poor daughter is upset."
R11LWVWHKL3DDI,cost way to much to buy another one to replace.
R11LWVWHKL3DDI,put two different sets of batteries in and still nothing.

R33XNUWEPC01FD,"soft doll with zipper, big button, snap and velcro."
R33XNUWEPC01FD,nice as just a doll and also for fine motor activities.
R33XNUWEPC01FD,the zipper is pretty short and the button is big so its easier for toddlers to practice.
R33XNUWEPC01FD,"my kids like to ""get her dressed"" but dont play with her for long."
R33XNUWEPC01FD,shes got a cute face and her hair is fabric.
R2I85FJGMR5UWJ,"the costume looks cheap, unpleasent for the girl to wear."

R3R5FAV0EM3XMZ,the quality of the product is cheap.
R3R5FAV0EM3XMZ,the product is not made for any kids who put things in their mouth.
R3R5FAV0EM3XMZ,the stick is very small and it is a choking hazard.
R3R5FAV0EM3XMZ,i gave it 3 stars because the quality of the sound is good for the size it is.

R3NH752E8QM7J3,i ordered a childs glove because i have very small hands and usually have to buy childrens gloves to fit my hands.
R3NH752E8QM7J3,"however, this item is indeed sized for a child and is way too small even for may tiny adult hands."

R1RUUPEW4AQQ0U,i love how i can use the bike now for my 8 month old and it will last for years to come!

R1PC2M03GVNUY3,my daughter and i had a lot of fun molding these ponies.
R1PC2M03GVNUY3,there are a few drawbacks.
R1PC2M03GVNUY3,the first is there is not enough doh to mold the pony youd like.
R1PC2M03GVNUY3,most of the containers are small and cant make a full pony.
R1PC2M03GVNUY3,"when the ponies you can make are complete, which is only three because there isnt enough to make a fourth, you would need to buy more doh which means you also need to buy more complete kits because extra molds arent sold separately.i gave four stars because it is a lot of fun, but now i know i need to buy everything in excess to be able to make what my daughter wants, which is not what any parent wants."
RZ1QMWU2BI6SE,this 2 pack kendama is a wonderful toy to have on the go.

R3HNDD4NB09DP3,who would have believed that silly putty would return to stores again after some 45 years or so.
R3HNDD4NB09DP3,"true to its original design, it will bounce take imprints of any surface copy a newsprint, such as a comic strip, and can stretch the image it sticks to a lot of surface can be molded into different shapesi had fun sharing this with younger people at work, my granddaughter and friends.combine 2 or more containers, and the putty makes a great stress relief ball.i love the deja vu element about this product."

R2MUKQQBU7T3CC,i will use this book as a resource for the flipit.

R201B4ZQ5RDJTC,"like most leapfrog products, it is about equal part entertainment and learning.like most kids, mine like technology."
R201B4ZQ5RDJTC,these imagicards combine technology with some what basically look like flash cards.
R201B4ZQ5RDJTC,"by using the camera on the leappad, kids can capture one of the imagicards which unlocks games and learning on the leappad.i love that the cards come in a nice tin which is so much more durable than a paper box would be."
R201B4ZQ5RDJTC,i think there could be more leaning content or variety in game play which is why i am only giving it 4 stars.
R2JM7JOY5Q9I7S,"very nice, i love it"
R1WDKZR5WX7RWJ,my 8 year old son absolutely loves nerf guns and the zombie line is particularly a favorite!

R1WDKZR5WX7RWJ,this has quickly become one of my sons favorite nerf guns and a product that i highly recommend!
R2D5V5HC1UK8QS,"a great game for firefly and clue fans, but i just cant shake the weirdness of having to hunt down which member of the crew helped kidnap river."
R2D5V5HC1UK8QS,for firefly fans it is a big load of fei hua to think anyone would sell out river well maybe jayne but otherwise it definitely feeds my firefly addiction.

R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"although this is not an ""official"" pok&eacutemon product, this umbreon plush is no doubt the biggest, cutest, softest, and best umbreon available!"
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"it ""purrfectly"" depicts this beautiful lunar black cat, just as he looks in the pok&eacutemon games, with vivid colours, and spoton accurate details.you will not find a single identifying tag on this plush no hang tag or tush tag, as it is a custom pattern based directly on the awesome takaratomy small umbreon asinb00a84g21e takaratomy pokemon n47 umbreonblacky best wishes 8&34 plush doll plush pattern i have attached photos to compare the two  only expanded to two times the size!"
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"it is a perfect replica of the real umbreon, accurately designed, and not one detail is missing.this umbreon is very lifelike, and large  approximately 13 inches tall!"
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"he sits up on his own, excellently balanced, without any need for extra support, so you can easily display him on a bed, shelf, desk, or anywhere you would like.the materials used to make this plush are highquality."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"like other reviewers mentioned, this umbreon special in that the material used to make his fur is actually jetblack instead of the more grayishblacklooking shades used on some of the other umbreon plushies by takaratomy and banpresto."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,the black &34fur&34 is also very soft and velvety to the touch.
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"the circular golden markings on his forehead and legs are precisely embroidered with shiny bright yellow thread, and his catlike red eyes with slit pupils also masterfully embroidered onto the face, are piercing and intense, true to the real umbreon."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"he has a short feline muzzle with a tiny triangular black nose, and a cute little grin although these details are somewhat difficult to see at first, as they blend in with his jetblack fur."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"all over, his figure is perfect and accurate!"
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"he is stuffed to purrfection, and although he is very lithe in shape, he is supersoft, squishy, and very cuddly."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"his rabbitlike ears are stuffed thickly, so they stand upright do not flop, and they have beautiful golden yellow ring patterns around them."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"the tail is the same, constructed and wellstuffed, just like the ears."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"his feline paws and feet are very beautifully detailed, with digits sewn in."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"his lovely detailed front paws are sewn together by thick threads, and i would not advise separating them, as it might result in damaging the plush.being an eeveelution fanatic and cat lover, i adore umbreon as well has his psychictype sister, espeon, and could not be more delighted with this incredible plush."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"he is one of my top favourites, and is always there for me to cuddle."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"he is perfect to snuggle with hugging a soft plushie comforts me and helps me sleep, and this umbreon has become one of my main cuddle buddies."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,i call him &34phantom&34.
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,i ordered this beautiful extralarge umbreon plush from a very kind and honest seller on ebay.
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"these extralarge eeveelution plushies are made in and sold from china, so it will take some time to ship, but it is worth the wait."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"again, this is not an official nintendo plush, but in my personal opinion it is actually better and more fairly priced than any official umbreon plush currently available."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"i have both the small takaratomy umbreon and the banpresto ""i love eevee"" large umbreon, but this umbreon is my favourite because it is so large and soft."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"it is a truly awesome size, durable, wellmade, and so cute!"
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"highly recommended to children and collectors  and cat lovers, of course!"
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"ike ears are stuffed thickly, so they stand upright do not flop, and they have beautiful golden yellow ring patterns around them."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"the tail is the same, constructed and wellstuffed, just like the ears."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"his feline paws and feet are very beautifully detailed, with digits sewn in."
R1O0VT2TZ8YY83,"his lovely detailed front paws are sewn together by thick threads, and i would not advise separating them, as it might result in damaging the plush.being an eeveelution fanatic and cat lover, i adore umbreon as well has his psychictype sister, espeon, and could not be more delighted with this incredible plush."

R2LCFSJ0LT321U,caution thinner than water!
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,"i highly recommend testing your first time with rubber gloves, safety goggles, a scrap of test material, and some acetone nearby."
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,"i did none of the above and left skin on the two parts, on my new ball cap which, in my panic, i reached for nearest piece of cloth turning anything just layin around on my bench into part of my bench, or my hands.id give 5 stars if this warning were prominently displayed on bottle."
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,"alas, bottles too small."
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,i cant get my pharmacist to ease off on the instructions and warnings for every bottle he dispenses.
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,"please take a page and put it in a box with more information, and warnings.great glue tho."
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,"perfect for cracked china, veneer repair, many wood shop uses.bottle is identical to gorilla brands ca line."
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,except smiths has solved the label problem with theirs wrapping the entire circumference.
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,gorillas labels just fall off.
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,"kind of embarrassing for a glue company, dont ya think?"
R2LCFSJ0LT321U,"in their defense, they make really good sticky stuff, super tactical duck tape thats often used accidentally for callus removal."
R2GVA4VQ8MIUSD,so stinking cute!
R2GVA4VQ8MIUSD,perfect in every way !

R338UO6QA6K5K6,i was very impressed with this figure.
R338UO6QA6K5K6,the paint job is stunning and the accessories are wonderful.
R338UO6QA6K5K6,the articulations are perfect from head to toe.
R338UO6QA6K5K6,there is one minor defect with the figure i received.
R338UO6QA6K5K6,her left knee joint is not as perfectly painted or otherwise produced and offends my ocd perfection.
R338UO6QA6K5K6,"however, like i mentioned before, the articulations work perfectly regardless."
RX9XWFAKJHF40,i totally remember having one of these!
RX9XWFAKJHF40,i loved baking treats for my family and then eating them.

RL9ZTVU5PQ8OK,"once i got my package, my son opened it up, charged it and played with it."
RL9ZTVU5PQ8OK,"but a few minutes later he told me that it wasnt working, so i took it apart and found out that the small gear, the one attached to the motor, kept coming up every other minute."
RL9ZTVU5PQ8OK,"so very carefully i worked on it for about 30 minutes, finally got that gear to stay in place."
RL9ZTVU5PQ8OK,"once i gave my son back his car, he could not stop playing with it!"
RL9ZTVU5PQ8OK,now that the gear stays in place we dont have to have a screw driver handy for whenever the gear came out of place.
RL9ZTVU5PQ8OK,the car works perfectly and it is a blast to build long tracks with him and watch the car zoom by!
RL9ZTVU5PQ8OK,"i am giving this item a 45 star rating because the toy didnt work out of the package, but once i fixed it my son and i have had hours of fun playing with it together."
RUOPMFFLBNADM,so this product showed up and i cant say where it happened or who done it but upon taking it out of the box i noticed one of the wooden pieces was badly damaged.
RUOPMFFLBNADM,enough so that i dont even want to give it to my daughter for her birthday now.
RUOPMFFLBNADM,its nice to give that much money then receive tore up s
R2YTXO668HD2JT,"i am so thankful you sent this to me....i cannot find my receipt for this purchase and while almost everything else i get from amazon is awesome, this has been quite disappointing."
R2YTXO668HD2JT,"these both worked for about a week, then the ability to turn the sprayer off, stopped working, therefore the batteries wear out quickly!"
R2YTXO668HD2JT,these were birthday gifts for my 7 and 4 year old grandsons and were by far their favorite while they worked!
R2YTXO668HD2JT,please tell me what to do to remedy this solution!
R2YTXO668HD2JT,"thank you, terri neal, ,"

RC5OYUBOZUUCA,everything about the gear was fine it fit every thing worked it just was not hat i was looking for.
R361XR50N0JA92,"good product, expanded my stampede mounting area to mount telemetry expander housing."
R361XR50N0JA92,"only drawback would be that you cannot use this product if you extend your battery compartment for larger lipo batteries, unless you come up with some custom standoffs for the front mounting points."
R361XR50N0JA92,"this is actually a manufacturer issue which they do not warn users, even on their own site."
R361XR50N0JA92,"overall, a great product."
RP7W46RRP33D0,this set is stunning with the detail characteristic of schleich figures.
RP7W46RRP33D0,the rider is really beautiful with an expression that seems like she is about to tell me something or do something special with her staff and magical orb.
RP7W46RRP33D0,the wrist on the hand that holds the staff moves but she cannot drop the staff.
RP7W46RRP33D0,the fits well on the unicorn and is easy to place on and remove once you get the hang of putting her leg between the two pieces of mane that cleverly hold her in.
RP7W46RRP33D0,the detail on the unicorn is just as perfect as the rider.
R1AT2AQ3PSZW68,this was just perfect for a friend who is undergoing chemo treatments and lost all his hair
R3KG0H83Q4RQ5O,gracias
R3DIULSQW6IKV4,ive bough and loved reusable sticker kits from peaceable kingdom before and i was a little underwhelmed with this one.
R3DIULSQW6IKV4,"its totally cute in theory, but the stickers dont stick quite as well as they should, and roll up on themselves as you peel them off, which makes it a little difficult for my almost 4 year old to do she did the airplane kit at 2 years and loved it."
R3DIULSQW6IKV4,so we ended up losing almost all of the stickers within the first two times playing with it.
R374812AXMJYM4,perfect costume for a party!
R11AZTF81VIKJH,its prefect
R14VK9GO96FQU5,purchased these for a wide assortment of colors for school.
R14VK9GO96FQU5,happy with the array of colors.
R4VJ4OUTITBML,not my favorite.
R1DRQ9GA5YESHA,very basic...no color and 23 of the icons are cut in half.
R1DRQ9GA5YESHA,becomes boring very quickly.

RHOR9YL0GH7LM,we bought the fold and go art studio for my daughter when she was 2. she is now 4 and still uses it a few times a week.
RHOR9YL0GH7LM,it is perfect for her to sit and draw or use the easel to paint with watercolors.
RHOR9YL0GH7LM,the little stool is just the right height and size.
RHOR9YL0GH7LM,i love how she can explore her creativity using this studio.
RHOR9YL0GH7LM,"its sturdy and easy to clean, which is a necessity with a toddler and art materials!"

R16OW8HIJFZZE5,works great.
R3IXJRBWWXYGBO,great for any kid who loves dinasours.
RVWW678OIE9XE,this is a really cool dinosaur.
RVWW678OIE9XE,"it transforms into a car, but it still looks boxy like a dinosaur."
RVWW678OIE9XE,"there are only four flaps in the transformation, but its pretty cool in its simplicity.there is a battery that does sound effects, and the sound effects are actually pretty cool."
RVWW678OIE9XE,"there is a switch where you can turn the effects off, 13rd level sound, or full sound."
RVWW678OIE9XE,"it comes with a aaa battery included, and it starts out on the reduced sound setting."
RVWW678OIE9XE,"so, that way your kid doesnt get used to loud sounds coming from this right from the box."
RVWW678OIE9XE,"at first, i thought that the sound was broken, because its so slight, but this is pretty awesome that you get to choose different levels.there are two red sound buttons that you can press for different sound effects, and it makes different effects based on whether its a dinosaur or if its a car."
RVWW678OIE9XE,"so, overall there are about twenty different sound effects, which is a ton for a toy like this.this is one of those cars that you can push a few times, and the wheels will keep spinning."
RVWW678OIE9XE,"then you drop it on the floor, and it goes."
RVWW678OIE9XE,"at first, i thought that the battery would help propel it, but the battery is just for sound effects."
RVWW678OIE9XE,theres a rev engine inside that you have to charge by pushing it on the ground a few times before you release it.

R3QRKS4BJ6Q9M1,you can move the mouth or you can move the front legs...a little hard to do both at the same time.
R3QRKS4BJ6Q9M1,"my children are older now, but they would have loved this puppet when they were younger."

R1QQEDT2J804M0,"i used the 12v cable from my turningy accucell6 battery charger because the socket size is the same, and the red led came on."
R1QQEDT2J804M0,"but when i plugged the battery in, all it would do is momentarily flash the green light and the red light stayed on, indicating it was doing nothing."
R1QQEDT2J804M0,"according to the only included directions, which are on the front of the charger, when you plug in the charger to power the red light will come on."
R1QQEDT2J804M0,when you plug the battery in the green light is supposed to come on also.
R1QQEDT2J804M0,when i plugin a battery nothing happens except that momentary flash of green.
R1QQEDT2J804M0,it does not appear to be charging.
R1QQEDT2J804M0,i tried this with a 3s 2200 mah 11.1v battery that was depleted to 10v and an identical battery that was charged to about 90 at 12.3v and both did the same thing.
R1QQEDT2J804M0,theres no buttons on here so its anyones guess to what its doing.
R1QQEDT2J804M0,"and since the green light does not even stay on, i dont trust this thing."
R2UOHYXU2G0LLJ,absolutely beautiful.
R2UOHYXU2G0LLJ,she is so pretty with her translucent sleeves and bow.
R2UOHYXU2G0LLJ,i love her pigtails they are longer than the original sailor moon figure.
R2UOHYXU2G0LLJ,this figure really captures super sailor moon.
R2UOHYXU2G0LLJ,the figure is durable and very well crafted.
R2UOHYXU2G0LLJ,i wish she had more change out faces though.
R2UOHYXU2G0LLJ,the holy grail and her moon rod also add a nice touch.
R2UOHYXU2G0LLJ,couldnt be happier.
R2UOHYXU2G0LLJ,cant wait to complete my collection with sailor pluto
R37T02FH1OGP7R,bought this but filled it up with beans instead of water to help work on some sensory issues.
R37T02FH1OGP7R,good quality and great idea to recycle the water.
R10V84FA4OIT9F,its ok.
RLAJOUEX7SHFF,great little set for the peppa lover!
RLAJOUEX7SHFF,"rather small, but still cute and can easily provide some fun for the little ones."
R2ZDUB2RYXUYJ0,better quality than anticipated!
R1BN5HXSGPPJJY,good quality!
R1BN5HXSGPPJJY,much better than costumes that cost same or more in the store.
R2EOS433NTH1CB,one of my favorite games as a kid!
R2EOS433NTH1CB,my crew of 7 loved it too!
R2EOS433NTH1CB,"but now i get why my folks always groaned, pieces break easily with less than gentle kid handling so be prepared to juryrig the set up, which takes a few minutes and longer if you dont know what youre doing."
R2EOS433NTH1CB,but otherwise super fun for all ages!
R7GJ6H651JJ0R,"all in all, a really good magic set."
R7GJ6H651JJ0R,quality and nicely designed.
R7GJ6H651JJ0R,i may have given it to my daughter too young.
R7GJ6H651JJ0R,"however, she and her friends made their own magic with it."
R7GJ6H651JJ0R,it still gets pulled out every once in a while.
R3KHQQPD5AI77A,"the sleeves hold up well, have a nice shuffle feel, and the artwork is great."
R3KHQQPD5AI77A,"i use these sleeves for when i draft, and they have no damaged corners from a month of fnm drafts.that said, i bought these with the intention of doublesleeving my deck and they are impossible to doublesleeve with because of the size they cut the sleeves at."
R3KHQQPD5AI77A,you would have better luck with the glossyfinish legion sleeves if you want to perfectfit your expensive deck and have it look good.
R3KHQQPD5AI77A,i just wish that legion would make their doublematte graphic sleeves doublesleevable.
R1FZI0WP3M16Q4,very detailed this was for my gf birthday but it came in so warily i was really happy about it and she loved it best quality i seen in a figure
RUGIGP0ME96CE,looks and works well
R14SC3UXNWDRGM,cute item
R2O8KYNR1585AL,this came broke!
R3W4N5KBB6VGMM,"cute but does not have any cord to wear as a necklace, arrived a few days before i expected it to."
REKQQYYX4K11F,"hard to do in a way... pieces fit in different places, you constantly are changing them around."
REKQQYYX4K11F,a bit of a challenge.
REKQQYYX4K11F,dont enjoy that type of puzzle as much as others.
REKQQYYX4K11F,"but, it was pretty when finished, if i actually got them all in the right places???"
REKQQYYX4K11F,?
R1FSZMD36JTK2H,great gift
RXBLJBS8D1AXP,we love this wagon!
RXBLJBS8D1AXP,"its durable and sturdy, but not too heavy to push around."
RXBLJBS8D1AXP,"the wheels are good quality too, so it doesnt lose traction."
RXBLJBS8D1AXP,my 2year old son fits in it with some of his things and i think another small child would fit easily too.
RXBLJBS8D1AXP,"i like that it folds up, so it doesnt take up much space when being stored."
RJ6LDRXLT5NEK,good quality and have held up well after an entire year.
RJ6LDRXLT5NEK,my girls love playing grocery store and this was the perfect addition to their market

R1F2GDH0JBZINL,my son was so excited to get this toy!
R1F2GDH0JBZINL,it seems well made too.
RFH44CHYPGPD4,"alarm is a annoing beep sound from 80s, not a song!"
RFH44CHYPGPD4,song only plays if you press song button which is useless.
RFH44CHYPGPD4,alarm will sound for 15 minutes unless turn off with inconvenient switch on the back.
R11658NMGPWEPM,i loved this as a desktop toy.
R11658NMGPWEPM,"there are definitely better ones out there, but not for this price."
R11658NMGPWEPM,i eventually got bored of it and sold it at a garage sale and got my money back.
R396M5497T8NNS,this cover is not made well.
R396M5497T8NNS,always slips off.
R396M5497T8NNS,almost impossible to put on without a second person.
R396M5497T8NNS,"i purchased it to keep the pool covered, but since it always fell off i gave up & left of off."
R396M5497T8NNS,it also has a hole after 2 months of not staying on.
R2YS0HBSNUE1GI,its pretty nice if you just need a little piece to connect things.
R286Z5HENAPTGQ,gift

R1SQBK5XHVDF7F,my son loves it.
R1SQBK5XHVDF7F,great addition to his other little sesame street figures.
R1SQBK5XHVDF7F,he carries them around proudly.
R1SQBK5XHVDF7F,they are known as cookie and bert.
R1SQBK5XHVDF7F,ive only sat on cookie monster one time and it wasnt nearly as painful as the elmo figure so thats a nice bonus for me.
R22309TP7EL57Z,just as promised!
R3OHYYXQPKE47B,an absolutely adorable and great quality figma!
R3OHYYXQPKE47B,the figure looks exactly like the pictures and came neatly and securely packaged.
R3OHYYXQPKE47B,definitely a must have for any mami tomoe fans!
R1MPANNWO25180,i spend a lot of time hiking and camping in remote locations and love having the urpower power bank with me so i can keep my phone charged in case of emergencies and when im taking pictures.
R1MPANNWO25180,i received the 3000mah external battery pack along with a usb cable that charges the power bank and can be reversed to charge my samsung s5.
R1MPANNWO25180,i have included pictures for reference.the power bank uses a liion polymer cell battery that quickly and efficiently charges my device without overheating itself or my phone.
R1MPANNWO25180,its compact size makes it easily portable and fits in my hiking pack without taking up much space and adding weight.
R1MPANNWO25180,"the external battery has microchips that prevent overcharging, overvoltage and short circuits, so i have extra security when using it."
R1MPANNWO25180,"disclaimer i received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
R1MPANNWO25180,"regardless, im very happy with the urpower power bank and would happily purchase."
R2Z4QNYAZ3UJ6C,awesome game!
R3TNJJXAH0I5Z,we received this for a gift and it was in perfect brand new condition.
R3TNJJXAH0I5Z,we had to remove all the battery pull tabs on the little car.
R3TNJJXAH0I5Z,"no discoloring on the truck, and box was in good shape!"
RWEBYL9NMVQW9,purchasing this was such a waste of time.
RWEBYL9NMVQW9,first the package was kinda opened already.
RWEBYL9NMVQW9,"i thought ""crap, this isnt gonna work."
RWEBYL9NMVQW9,"someone had already purchased this it probably didnt work""."
RWEBYL9NMVQW9,"but, i decided to try it out."
RWEBYL9NMVQW9,and... it didnt work.

R3S6VA2Y40CPM7,thank you funko for knowing the fandom and knowing wed want to put the funko doctors in this.
R3S6VA2Y40CPM7,"how can you have a tardis and not put a doctor in it?as many others have stated, the back of mine does look a little beat up."
R3S6VA2Y40CPM7,but its the back and no one see it.
R3S6VA2Y40CPM7,"as long as the front looks presentable, im ok with it."
R3S6VA2Y40CPM7,ive got many funkos with painting issues and i just tend to deal with it.i love this.

R2PDK9PYW3MLBH,the little guy just loves these!
R2PDK9PYW3MLBH,"the design is perfect for the young carbustrucktractor enthusiast in the family, and theyre made of highquality 100 cotton, very comfortable!"
R2PDK9PYW3MLBH,"i agree with the reviewer who said this cotton is ""substantial"" and ""crisp"" if youre looking for a satiny feel, you wont find it here."
R2PDK9PYW3MLBH,"just crisp, comfortable, 100 cotton."
R3PJLFN1T59WCK,absolutely the best purchase for lunchbox meals.

R15CPW86EA5H3Z,"we put the selected or ready cards out, put beads by the spell level, and take the beads away as we cast the spells."
R15CPW86EA5H3Z,really nice way to do it if you can afford the little extras.
R15CPW86EA5H3Z,"id get a different color bead for each spell level to make resorting things easier.cards have great descriptions for short spells and page numbers for longer descriptions, plus all casting info you could need, so much more handy than digging through the phb each time."

R35XR9RV2XLQBH,solid quartz only in the middle.
R35XR9RV2XLQBH,false advertising
R2D8C1ZN6BC0QW,great product exactly as expected.
R3ATMLIVNJUFEL,i had high hopes for this little guyprobably too high for something thats a factory reject.
R3ATMLIVNJUFEL,"i wouldnt have minded if it were just the fact that the spots on his stomach were off center, or that the backing plastic from the embroidery was left on the outside so i had to painstakingly snip it off."
R3ATMLIVNJUFEL,"however, the overall quality is pretty bad."
R3ATMLIVNJUFEL,the fur is out of controlit covers up the features so it doesnt look even vaguely like the photo of the product.
R3ATMLIVNJUFEL,the worst is that the fur also falls out in clumps.
R3ATMLIVNJUFEL,"ah well... it was cheap, and i got what i paid for a grey, sort of lumpy thing that might look like totoro if i squinted and tilted my head."
RMVO9ANTERIUC,"cmon, pink unicorns?!"

R18VDHMAGJT3LR,this hamper did exactly what i wanted and needed except the handles did not last very long.
R18VDHMAGJT3LR,"the first time i had it stuffed to the brim and tried to pick it up using the handles, both handles snapped and broke."
R18VDHMAGJT3LR,the material is very thin and cheaply made but it serves its purpose for the price i paid.

R14XAHX5W08ZYZ,cool
R34QK43FGZNGVW,i was surprised at how easy it was for my daughter age 6 to use this spinning bracelet loom with minimal assistance.
R34QK43FGZNGVW,she absolutely loves being able to make bracelets for herself and her friends.
R34QK43FGZNGVW,"she finds this a bit easier than the ""rubber band"" bracelets that have been popular in recent years and we usually have to help her quite a bit with those."
R34QK43FGZNGVW,"for me, the string style friendship bracelets have nostalgia for me from when i was a kid and used to make these."
R34QK43FGZNGVW,i like how you have 6 different options with this kit for styles of bracelet.
R34QK43FGZNGVW,"once you consider that you can use a variety of different colors, the possibilities of bracelets really are endless."
R34QK43FGZNGVW,this would make a really great gift for crafty kids possibly in the 612 year old range.
R34QK43FGZNGVW,"its a great crafting project and while the loom is plastic, it seems sturdy enough to hold up over time."
R34QK43FGZNGVW,replacement string is cheap and easily found at craft stores.
R34QK43FGZNGVW,"overall, im very impressed with this product and may purchase others to give to her friends as birthday gifts."
R11XC6D3X5ULZ1,my favorite game when drinking.

R3SU9RTBXVJ9SE,we bought these as a joke at work for myself and other members of the team.
R3SU9RTBXVJ9SE,"we have assumed ""alteregos"" with each pup and found ourselves giddy like kids over happy meal toys!"

R1J7PQJL5GDCL7,"one of the decorations fell apart before the end of the party, but other than that, a cute set."
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,wow.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,this was kinda amazing.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,these are the same as legos.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,"my son really wanted a darth maul so i bought this set, which was half the price of a lego darth maul figure, and he is thrilled."
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,takes a bit more work because you do have to pretty much assemble each figure from scratch.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,so you can buy these eight figures for under $7 or you can buy a fully assembled single lego figure for about $15 to $20 one of the darth mauls is $30.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,"so, it depends on whether you have more time or money."
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,took me about 10 minutes to put them all together.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,"but, you dont get a box, which was someones complaint that gave this a onestar review."
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,yeah.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,right.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,a box.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,that im going to throw away.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,"oh, and a hint."
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,3cpo comes with a light saber for some reason.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,"if you look at darth mauls light saber handle, theres a spot on both ends for a saber beam."
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,"take cpos beam and stick it in darth mauls handle and, tada, the infamous doublebladed light saber!"
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,cpo never had a light saber anyway.
R2KKTVXRZD5IXL,jeez.

R23AQKKMM09RXN,"good price, quality for coin collecting"
R2RV6I6YD3347H,i bought this for my 3 year olds birthday after he loved playing with it at our photographers.
R2RV6I6YD3347H,so even though it says 12 months its very fun for a preschooler too.
R2RV6I6YD3347H,he loves to take pictures of everyone and likes that it shows one of four different faces on the back for your pretend picture.

RPKWYSBHO2R8C,one little girly girl is very happy with this set.
RPKWYSBHO2R8C,her brother plays with legos all day long.
RPKWYSBHO2R8C,now she feels she has a set all her own.
RPKWYSBHO2R8C,"she is just barely six and this set was challenging enough to engage her, but not too difficult that she felt she couldnt be successful."
RPKWYSBHO2R8C,"she did ask for help occasionally, but did most of the work herself."
RPKWYSBHO2R8C,"unlike her brother, who relies solely on the picture, she followed the directions stepbystep."
RPKWYSBHO2R8C,"it took her more than a day to complete, but she was not troubled by this."
RPKWYSBHO2R8C,"she was very pleased that she had her own legos, and she was very pleased with herself when she had everything ""just so""."

R37FHF9JJNGHI8,"my 1.5 year old little girl loves to play with my purse, and was ecstatic to finally have one of her own."
R37FHF9JJNGHI8,"she kind of plays with them as separate toys rarely carries the kitten around inside the purse, and is more interested putting other toys inside to carry around, but really enjoys playing with them both."
R37FHF9JJNGHI8,very decent quality for the price!

R89IRLC1BZZN8,very small and cute
R3V79QKK4EKKSA,this cmc met all of my expectations and more.
R3V79QKK4EKKSA,from front boot to the engine compartment the detail and quality are very good.
R3V79QKK4EKKSA,this model is nearly identical to the irish green 1967 911 that my brother owned for more than 40 years.
RQMMCWAE9D2I9,they do not fill all the way.
RQMMCWAE9D2I9,many have holes and they leak once filled.
RQMMCWAE9D2I9,i would say 1 in three balloons is actually useful.
RQMMCWAE9D2I9,so basically a waste of money.
RQMMCWAE9D2I9,they are easy to fill though.
R2P96SRKBVTO77,"really cheap plastic, but for the price i dont feel bad recycling use."
R2P96SRKBVTO77,glad it was available.

R1TMVBEF9YBD5O,i bought this as a gift for a family member who is a huge marilyn monroe fan.
R1TMVBEF9YBD5O,the bill came faster than expected in a business sized envelope.
R1TMVBEF9YBD5O,the bill itself was packaged in a firm plastic holderenvelope within the exterior envelope.
R1TMVBEF9YBD5O,very great shape and beautiful bill.
R1TMVBEF9YBD5O,the giftee was very impressed and happy for this gift.
R1TMVBEF9YBD5O,a great gift idea for any fan.

R6CUQT42UFJ3D,daughter loves this
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,every1 of the 1st 4 aliens films had ensemble casts.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,a corollary of that is that the cast is very diverse.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,"there are men, women, and children whites, blacks, and a hispanic adults & a child and, of course, an alien that goes through stages like a butterfly."
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,"remember brad dourifs statement in ""alien resurrection."""
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,you could play ripley and hicks as a romantic couple.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,add newt to the mix and you can consider them a hodgepodge nuclear family.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,"if adventurous, you can pretend that vasquez and ripley got together in a lindseysamantha thang."
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,i have 1 problem here.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,many toylines uses models of the same size.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,i guess it reduces price.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,you do want the toys so that small children in their oral phase wont swallow them.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,"however, newt was a child much smaller than ripley and the marines."
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,here she is presented as just as big.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,"you would think she was the cowardly female in the 1st ""alien"" if you didnt read who the characters were supposed to be."
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,this whole collection is a type of camp.
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,"hardcore fans like comic book guy from ""the simpsons"" wouldnt open the box."
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,"however, this ensemble may be nice as a campy item to have in your cube or on your desk at work."
R2NNBEKLH77Q1F,"i could imagine children loving the toys but having nightmares about the film, so be careful in showing it to them."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"i honestly cant stop using this, even just going back and forth around the hallways in my house is so much fun.yes, it looks a lot like a segwey without handles, and thats pretty much exactly what it is."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"but its even harder to get used to at first, because it feels so unnatural to lean forward or backward on something with only two wheels, and you dont even have handles as a safety blanket."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,but you really dont need them.
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"you just have to learn to trust the device and ignore your brains nagging about how its going to make you fall over.there is absolutely no assembly, so setting it up consists only of charging the batter, which is included, internal, and nonreplaceable."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,this takes about an hour.
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"but on a full charge, it has a decent amount of life in it."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"between zooming around my house, and around my neighborhood sidewalks for over an hour, it was still going strong.it also includes leds on the front of each foot, which are kind of nice although not really necessary."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"they help light your way a little bit, but if it was too dark to see without them, id still probably recommend against using it in the first place.although the leds kind of suggest which way is front and back, you can actually face either direction and the device will operate identically either way.actual usage is as simple as angle each foot forward or backward depending on how fast you want to go."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"so if you lean both feet forward, youll start going forward."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"if you have your right foot going backward, and left foot forward, youll rotate clockwise."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"it is capable of going much faster than i even dare going, so while i couldnt get myself to max out its speed, i can definitely attest to it being very fast for what it is.the trickiest thing about using it is going over bumps or cracks."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"due to how it works, and how small the wheels are, even small bumps and cracks can be very disruptive."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"if any part of it leaves the ground for any period of time, it has a harder time detecting how much pressure each foot is pressing on it, making it unpredictable."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"so i would strongly advise using it in as flat and smooth of area as possible.so basically, once you get past the initial learning phase, this becomes extremely fun as long as you keep it in a tame area without too many obstructions."
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,i literally just hop on and off of it randomly throughout the day to zip around my kitchen and halls just for fun.
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"very addictive and unique way to travel!pros works fantastically, selfbalancing is spoton comes completely assembled so it is super easy to set up batter life is much better than i anticipated its surprisingly silent, even while traveling at high speeds gets a lot of attention from onlookers simply due to its uniqueness and awesomeness can go very fast!"
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"its actually kind of scary when using it at high speeds great style and design, looks sleek and holds up fairly well to general use wheel leds are a nice touch to give you extra lighting towards the direction youre going fun!cons questionable handling of bumps, cracks, and obstructions... cruise carefully!"
R1E5SDSWC7MQTV,"battery isnt replaceable, so if you dont use best practices to keep it conditioned, the whole unit becomes useless pricey!r any period of time, it has a harder time detecting how much pressure each foot is pressing on it, making it unpredictable."

RWDPPHISLTNCY,has proven to be quite durable.
RWDPPHISLTNCY,my two grandsons have been on it almost daily for 3 weeks.
RWDPPHISLTNCY,it also weathered a birthday party with at least 10 little boys ages 4 to 6. has already paid for itself in entertainment value.
R3CR61WBBVY7DM,"my grandson loved these, they were his favorite present at his birthday party."
REBAY9UTV0LWK,we really like this double stroller that my daughter received for her 4th birthday.
REBAY9UTV0LWK,easy to set up.
REBAY9UTV0LWK,collapses when not in use.
REBAY9UTV0LWK,"the front wheels do no swivel, but my kids do not seem troubled by this."
REBAY9UTV0LWK,the basket for storage or for another doll is great.
ROLU8BT65OZTM,i bought this clock because its the only model that fits in a pocket.
ROLU8BT65OZTM,"besides the size, its a good clock as well the display numbers are large, and it supports bonus and delay modes."
ROLU8BT65OZTM,one particular feature i like when comparing to other dgt models is the ability to pause and change the time without having to turn the clock off and reset all from scratch its useful in tournaments that state time penalty for illegal moves.
ROLU8BT65OZTM,"note ive never played blitz with this clock, only standard and fast chess."
ROLU8BT65OZTM,"for blitz, i would recommend a more solid unit."

R4V790TL1JGZA,this thing has less power than a dollar store water pistol.
R4V790TL1JGZA,"i dont expect much from water guns in the way of range or accuracy, and this still managed to disappoint."
R36UMAGZG3WEWS,too small...my son didnt care for it
R3DU4R0H4J7AP9,zipper is terrible.
R3DU4R0H4J7AP9,my petite 4 year old daughter struggled to even breathe and move wearing it the first time for her cinderella party until finally the poor quality zipper busted open within 5 minutes beyond repair.
R3DU4R0H4J7AP9,i couldnt return it because i bought the dress over a month before her birthday so excited to have it for her party.
R3DU4R0H4J7AP9,now im at the point of no return with a broken dress that wasnt exactly cheap.
RL8B5NQ3PM7P2,my granddaughter loves them!

R2R16MSENOX7F5,"although, it arrived partially opened with missing parts and assembly nuts and bolts.cost about $40 at home depot to get what i needed and they only credited me $20 for the inconvenience."
RG4A22J06KWNC,these were a great addition to our treat bags at my daughters frozen birthday party.

R2KBU1GNIGI2JV,the molding is pretty darn good with nice folds and details.
R2KBU1GNIGI2JV,the paint is pretty clean.
R2KBU1GNIGI2JV,out of the entire character i only see a little yellow on his right thigh near his utility belt.
R2KBU1GNIGI2JV,once up on a monitor i dont notice it.
R2KBU1GNIGI2JV,pretty fun little addition to boring work environment.

R3C3S9V6LGMQND,product as described.
R3Q0P7TJYV0W06,worked as advertised!
R1V1TXHG2XRSD,it is definitely large.
R1V1TXHG2XRSD,"i had to add ceramic to continue doing some rocks, as i found out the hard way the mixing different hardness rocks is costly."
R1V1TXHG2XRSD,"also, if i could afford it, i would only use this for the coarsest tumbling and then go to a vibratory setup."
R1V1TXHG2XRSD,"because this tumbler holds so much stone, if you try to take it all the way to a polish the chances are that a chip or chips will break off and damage a lot of stone during the finer tumbling."
R1V1TXHG2XRSD,"i would also state that this tumbler lacks some of the touches that i would consider i high quality unit, but it seems durable for the price."
R1V1TXHG2XRSD,i have been using this constantly for the last two months.
RLBXXGCFME6QN,my son says he loves it.

R2N0NP4Z3M5H1O,bottom line a great family board game that is easy and fast to playlost cities  the board game on the surface is pretty easy to understand and play.
R2N0NP4Z3M5H1O,"if you can count to ten in order, you pretty much have all the skill required to play."
R2N0NP4Z3M5H1O,"that makes the game pretty open to all ages, although 9 or 10 would probably be the younger limit to be able to enjoy playing the game."
R2N0NP4Z3M5H1O,"playing a card moves one of your pieces across the board, and every spot on the board has a point value.there are two basic versions on how to play, the short game and the long game."
R2N0NP4Z3M5H1O,"short games are basically one round and take a bit more than 20 minutes, and the long games basically are three rounds of the game and take a bit more than an hour."
R2N0NP4Z3M5H1O,"there are other variations you can add on top of that, and with all board games you can always make your own house rules."
R2N0NP4Z3M5H1O,"for us, we enjoyed playing it where the tiles on the game board were not flipped over until a players piece landed on that spotwe felt that added to the exploration theme of the game and made it more fun for us, but thats just one example.game board, card and pieces are all high quality and well made."
R2N0NP4Z3M5H1O,"they should last a very long time with normal gameplay.while simple, we found the game fun and very approachable."
R2N0NP4Z3M5H1O,its easily a top choice for a casual game night with friends and family.
R2WRZEX347RFKC,this game is a practical way to learn about magnetism and the pull and push effects of it.
R2WRZEX347RFKC,"it is also a fun, handson game that engaged my 7yo who prefers movement oriented games."
R2WRZEX347RFKC,there are so many different ways of setting up the board mats that i can see this being a game that constantly has new challenges.
R2WRZEX347RFKC,"although the game says it is for 14, i got this to play with my 10 and 7yoboth of whom enjoyed it quite a bit!"
R2WRZEX347RFKC,"by the 3rd round, my 7yo was beginning to get some of the techniques involved to keep her piece safer from the magnetism of the other pieces."
R2WRZEX347RFKC,"a game lasts at most 510 minutes... so, its a quick game for short attention spans as well."
R1BORV3QJLZY11,"its great, i like it."
R1BORV3QJLZY11,easy to set up
RWMQ2GT7V4XSG,as someone with a lot of little girls in my family i am constantly on the lookout for outfits and accessories that will fit their american girl dolls at a lower cost.
RWMQ2GT7V4XSG,dress along dolly has become one of my favorite places to purchase items for them from.
RWMQ2GT7V4XSG,this doll bike helmet is one of my recent purchases and like the others in the past i could not be more pleased.
RWMQ2GT7V4XSG,available in pink pr purple its made of hard plastic that clips into place under your dolls chin and comes with adorable stickers to dress it up a little.

RWMQ2GT7V4XSG,i recieved this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
R3I1K7BTEWKWZ4,excellent purchase!
R1SECWYSP86GN9,this doll is absolutely gorgeous.
R1SECWYSP86GN9,the box and graphics make an impressive presentation.
R1SECWYSP86GN9,the accessories included have a great amount of decorative details.
R1SECWYSP86GN9,"the clothing is well stitched, not basted."
R1SECWYSP86GN9,"and she seems to be constructed to last for quite some time cant say the same of some other dolls weve purchased recently from ""ever after"" which fell apart the first day."
R1SECWYSP86GN9,"most of the dolls we have gotten from other brands cannot be posed, or only move one or two ways with visible joints."
R1SECWYSP86GN9,these are exceptionally well done.
R20LFQNLLGDKB6,prime complaints the bear has a big gash extending from the right arm all the way to mid way point on the neck.
R20LFQNLLGDKB6,this was hidden by the bow on the neck and thus was not apparent.
R20LFQNLLGDKB6,the bear is also not of great quality.
R20LFQNLLGDKB6,we already had a different teddy bear bought locally in us and compared to that this bear is way inferior.
R20LFQNLLGDKB6,"we could and should have returned it but my daughter who was waiting for this to arrive for a very long time, got attached and would not let us return.secondary complaints the bear is smaller than what is shown but also even than expectation."
R20LFQNLLGDKB6,came after what was an eternity though granted that was expected but the tracking number was of china post which obviously is of not much use.
R2L4TZ5B4HSCG0,definitely one of the better games my friends and i have gotten for our weekly board game group.
R2L4TZ5B4HSCG0,"it was made of excellent quality material that looks like it will last a long time, has an interesting and fast paced dynamic, arrived the day it was supposed to but later than the ""guaranteed"" time."
R2L4TZ5B4HSCG0,overall this purchase was worth the money hands down.
R3QZG8JQL7SOGW,i bought this as a gift for my nephew who loved it.
R3VSTA52V2GY48,"as indicated, the squares are approximately 6"" inches, so i should have realized that with only 28 pieces, it was not going to be that large."
R3VSTA52V2GY48,"the whole thing assembled is about the size of a yoga mat, definitely not 8.5 square feet as indicated in the description."
R3B5W4AOW2SEM1,fits perfectly with the kidkraft box!
R3B5W4AOW2SEM1,the color is more vibrant than i expected but still really cute for my little girls room.
R2M1O2IDY7J9TQ,not very strong
R2EA4N7T5LU6ID,"love it, but its weighed so that it falls forward when i try to stand it up on a flat surface."
R3BB1XJMF2TL8Z,worked perfectly!
R2WUR2L9KHMQ1T,it was easy to put up and works perfectly as a small shelf and hooks for items by the door.
R2WUR2L9KHMQ1T,i like that the shelf is solid and not slotted like some of the others.
R9IGA94IAK7R5,my great nephew loved it!
RI4SJQGBDRMHU,this is a fun bracelet making kit.
RI4SJQGBDRMHU,it makes keeping the threads separated quite a bit easier.
RI4SJQGBDRMHU,"the storage drawer on the bottom is convenient, and a nice option, but it often slides open while pulling on the threads."
RI4SJQGBDRMHU,it base also slides around on most surfaces it sits on.
RI4SJQGBDRMHU,i will be adding some rubber feet to the bottom to help the sliding.
R1SO05IHKK7RYO,it came so fast!!
R1SO05IHKK7RYO,very pleased with this outfit so cute.
R1SO05IHKK7RYO,"i got a size too big thinking he will grow into it by next month , but that was my error."
R1SO05IHKK7RYO,"fits to size , i highly recommend"

R3JYQA7BDHHX3D,"i am a high school math teacher, and i love these erasers that stick to my white board as it prevents my clothes and hands from picking up the black residue that accumulates on the bottom of the white board where erasers are normally stored."
R3JYQA7BDHHX3D,"i keep two erasers on my board at all times, and both erasers lasted me for an entire school year."
R3JYQA7BDHHX3D,thats a great return on my investment!the reason i only give four stars is that i have ordered 3 packs of these erasers.
R3JYQA7BDHHX3D,two packs were magnetic and stuck to my white board while the third pack of erasers did not.
R3JYQA7BDHHX3D,"however, amazon was very quick in processing my refund."
R3JYQA7BDHHX3D,it was just inconvenient to receive a pack that did not work.
RZCR3XXHSF4HV,i was familiar with this particular edition of sudoku so knew exactly what i was ordering.
RZCR3XXHSF4HV,this is a replacement for a game where one of the arrow keys has stopped working.
RZCR3XXHSF4HV,it stopped because the game is wearing out  i play sudoku a lot.
RZCR3XXHSF4HV,"the game fits in my hand nicely, numbers are easy to read and the keyboard is not too small."
RZCR3XXHSF4HV,i am very happy to have a replacement.
R356HYRL8PIGJQ,get punshment
RIWNS7EG0GRMP,so cute
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,this is a great toy that just pulls you in and suddenly hours have passed.first impression is that these little cars are sturdy.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,they have a nice heavy solid feel even without batteries.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,oh  youll need 8 aa batteries because the cars do not come with batteries.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,the battery trays are held in place with a small bolt and the bolt threads into something metal  way less danger of stripping those threads.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,nice.i ended up using an old ipad 2ish years old to run the r.e.v.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,app because my android tablets 3 or more years old werent compatible.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,minor annoyance  the google play store didnt tell me if any of my other android devices were compatible.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"also, the key to finding the app seemed to be searching for &34r.e.v.&34 including the periods."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,the app installed normally onto the ipad.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,also  something i really liked is that the android version said the app doesnt require extra permissions.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,i didnt notice permission stuff on the ipad.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"still, this is great because it means that the app isnt helping itself to your contact list n stuff.upon linking to the first car, the ipad said the cars firmware needed to update."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,the first update attempt hung.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,the faqs on the instruction booklet said to turn the car off then on.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,that worked.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,the second car required the exact same procedure including the hang.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"still, they did update quickly.the app is intuitive."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"touch the screen, move your finger, see what happens, adapt until you get it right."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"at first, the car seemed twitchy and hard to control."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"actually, it is touchy and hard to control."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,it doesnt take much to make that thing zip across the floor and ram a wall.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"luckily, the car so very sturdy and held up to many rammings."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"but... you can run into stuff for only so long before you want to check out battle mode and the ai.as before, the app is intuitive when it comes to setting up the car and the ai."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"the car has 4 &34slots&34 for stuff like weapons, healing, shielding, etc."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"messing around with the &34ai&34 screen lets you pick which ai will suddenly grab control of the other car, ram your car, and shoot it up."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"theres a progression of tougher ais to fight.next, tell the app it is time to fight, it counts down to zero visually, not audibly and then the ai springs to life, rams your car, makes shooting noises, and then the app says you lost the fight."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,the car battles do involve quite a few wrecks and rams.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,again  these cars are sturdy for a reason.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,"sadly, the app, at least the 8292015 version of it, doesnt tell you when youve won and there is no obvious way to restart."
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,i could tell id won when the ais health dial went to zero and the ai car wouldnt move anymore.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,i restarted by going into the ai screen and selecting a different ai which triggered a restart.oh yes  i ran the cars over carpet and tile.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,the carpet isnt all thick and luscious.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,there were no issues with running on either carpet or tile but the cars are fast on tile and make tighter turns on carpet.the time really flies while fighting those ais and that annoying twitchy handling is transformed into welcome responsiveness after a while.i have yet to battle a human.
R3I9HY8CCSIB8I,that will change soon.
R2K0JDIBZGYPNX,arrived on time and as expected.
R1913W0E4NHK75,probably the best set of tires ive ever owned!

R3QLB1UGGZACXT,excellent
R2YOC1N224YXO0,they are fun but lay crooked on my face and are a little hard to see through.
R2YOC1N224YXO0,they are definitely cheap but im happy with them for a poker night to wear for a little while to be funny.
R2QLD9CXA0ZVUL,"bought this for learning and taking some aerial videos, and it has exceeded my expectations in many ways."
R2QLD9CXA0ZVUL,"the video quality is better than i thought it would be, and it is very durable i crashed it into, trees walls it has even survived a landing in my pool."
R2QLD9CXA0ZVUL,it only spent a few seconds in the water and i quickly dried it out with a hairdryer for about 45 minutes and it was flying again.
R2QLD9CXA0ZVUL,"i then managed to get it stuck in a tree too  i blame this one on the throttle not responding fast enough it spent a few days outside in wind and rain, recovered it and it is still flying!"
R3CHW4GP6PLDIS,pretty great but its easy to take bites out of the foam.
R3CHW4GP6PLDIS,not for kids under 3.
RS1NHD76B4EPD,good quality product.
RS1NHD76B4EPD,happy after one and half months of ownership.
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,ok. did not purchase on amazon as i think its important to try and keep our local hobby shops alive and they can also be sources of help.
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,purchasing the inductrix was the result of such help.been into rc stuff for decades but exclusively cars and trucks.
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,came across a link to a tiny little estes proto x and thought &34well thats kinda cool&34 and ran out and bought the little bugger after watching some youtube videos which made it look super easy to fly... same with the blade nano qx 3d which i also purchased based on the reviews and videos on youtube which went on and on about how easy they are to fly... dont believe it!
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"easy is all relative...so, i get home all excited, charge up my new little quads ready to launch into a new hobby filled with precision flying and cat chasing."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"however, this is was not the case."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"instead i spent a good portion of my day trying to put tiny little rotors back onto the estes proto x and pushing motors back onto the motor mounts of the 3d... some decent level flight was had, but not much, mostly i just spent my time putting them back together."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"it reminded me of a similarly doomed venture a few years ago with rc helicopters, which ended with me giving away radios, batteries, chargers, and yes helicopters."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"turns out skill with driving, riding, and video games does not translate into rotary wing aircraft.all of which brings me to the inductrix."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"i was hesitant to buy the inductrix, after all i had two frustrating quads at home already with steep learning curves, wasnt interested in adding more frustration."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,felt as though my man card was already in jeopardy.
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"however, as the radio to the qx 3d will bind with the inductrix i took the clerks advice at hobbytown and purchased one.woohoo!"
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"success, finally a quad rotor that doesnt shatter or shed rotors at every misstep, a quad that seems to want to fly and work with me to improve or actually develop quad skills."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"the inductrix is stable, and perfect for someone who is a complete noob."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,its quiet by comparison to the others and a great way to tiptoe into the whole dronequad thing.
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"decent run time, inexpensive batteries, and a truly solid performer."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"its allowed me to establish true 58 minute flight times without terrorizing the cats, or shredding parts, very cool.so, if you are new to rc flight do not hesitate, this thing is excellent, its stable fun and follows directions better than the estes proto x, and blade nano qx 3d."
R3O5VQE1RPXQ0P,"however if you are not new then i might hesitate and all of this quads stability and lack of &34tricks&34 might make it kind of boring for you.is stable, and perfect for someone who is a complete noob."

R1UJI0GSNWPI4A,the doll comes in good condition eyes are accurate clothes are nice but when taken out of box the paint on his nose and chin wore off in a matter of days..so 3 stars
R2J3FTQPAJO64U,this toy is a piece of junk.
R2J3FTQPAJO64U,"my son got it as a birthday gift and loved it, but the onoff switch broke in 5 minutes."
R2J3FTQPAJO64U,"we returned the first and ordered another one hoping we would have better luck and within the first day the lights quit working and the audio keeps skipping like a broken record, even after a second set of brand new batteries."
R2J3FTQPAJO64U,"we are keeping it because my son loves it and doesnt want to return it, but it is very poor quality."
R2J3FTQPAJO64U,buyer beware!
R1P69YMDI9NVJH,"fast delivery, good quality yet very affordable"

R2TGTI502E6IHF,everything was as promised.
R2TGTI502E6IHF,thanks!
RQD1382V9WUF9,my kids were cheering when they animal planet dinosaur eggs arrived!
RQD1382V9WUF9,they tore into the package and asked me what the eggs were.
RQD1382V9WUF9,i explained we were going to place them in water and watch them hatch.
RQD1382V9WUF9,we placed the eggs in a cup of water and a little over 24 hours later they hatched!
RQD1382V9WUF9,the children were so excited to get to see the dinosaurs.
RQD1382V9WUF9,they went to get them out of the glasses and did not want to touch them after that.
RQD1382V9WUF9,i was curious so i picked one of them up.
RQD1382V9WUF9,they felt really slimy!
RQD1382V9WUF9,my children are special needs and have sensory issues.
RQD1382V9WUF9,the slimy feeling is a sensory trigger for them.
RQD1382V9WUF9,after about another 24 hours the dinosaurs dried out.
RQD1382V9WUF9,once they were dry the slimy texture disappeared.
RQD1382V9WUF9,once the dinos were dry the kids were happy to play with them.
RQD1382V9WUF9,we got to use the cards included in the box to discuss each of the dinosaurs.the one star i removed had to do with the weird texture of the dinosaurs when they were wet.disclaimer i received this product at a discount in order to test the product and give my honest feedback.

R2KTL35ODVCBBZ,the game is an instant stress reliever.
R2KTL35ODVCBBZ,"they use raisins or chocolate chips or nuts for the ""poo"" and fling away."
R2KTL35ODVCBBZ,the kids sometimes gang up on their mom who manages to get them back.
R2KTL35ODVCBBZ,"my soninlaw went out to the store, came back and found them playing this game."
R2KTL35ODVCBBZ,he hadnt seen it before and was trying to figure out what was going on.
R2KTL35ODVCBBZ,i got a phone call from him and all i heard in the background were shrieks of laughter.
R2KTL35ODVCBBZ,"he gave me some thanks for teaching the kids to play with ""poo""."
R2KTL35ODVCBBZ,the grandchildren are 10 and 13. great game.

R3JIWMU19I0BU2,"ive seen this one in 2015 at cvs, walgreens, and payless... but they are of course getting more difficult to locate."
R3JIWMU19I0BU2,if you can find it online at a good price i would just snag it because your chances im sure are decreasing daily.
R3JIWMU19I0BU2,i doubt this will be one that mattel will rerelease any time soon.
R3JIWMU19I0BU2,"all that aside, this is a musthave for your collection as it contains the very first car you see in the movie."
R3JIWMU19I0BU2,if only they made the model of him crushed into a cube!

RFLWKVJJ3IQ5L,"tough to inflate, even harder to deflate... but in between its a blast!"
RFLWKVJJ3IQ5L,our kids have had so much fun with this.
RFLWKVJJ3IQ5L,they just love climbing inside and being rolled around the yard.
RFLWKVJJ3IQ5L,the plastic that it is made from is surprisingly tough and has taken a good deal of abuse.
RFLWKVJJ3IQ5L,i usually make my kids take their shoes off to climb in but it would probably be ok with them on too.
RFLWKVJJ3IQ5L,im sure it could be punctured but so far we have not had any issues.
RFLWKVJJ3IQ5L,i also like that the seams were doublereinforced in the critical parts the openings where they climb in and out.
RFLWKVJJ3IQ5L,older kids might be too rough for it but for mine ages 5 and 3 it has been perfect.
RFLWKVJJ3IQ5L,if you are thinking of buying this make sure you have a compressor or inflator handy!
R2Q4U9Z8PS4HS4,awesome purchase.

R2GQ0YGZM1PQ59,"it was very nice but not what i was looking for.for a display for holidays it is great and i recommend it, but i will be using it for a light in my attic window and using it mostly year roundand therefore i was looking for something a little less flashy.but i recommend it if this is what you are looking for.abby 9278"
RJSK8E6RH6HUL,this is a very cute product.
RJSK8E6RH6HUL,"it is very small, fits in the palm of my hand."
RJSK8E6RH6HUL,"the concept is very clever in that it uses a dual rotor, selfstabilizing propulsion system."
RJSK8E6RH6HUL,"it charges very quickly from the control box, which also doubles as a carrying case for the kopter."
RJSK8E6RH6HUL,"apparently, i am not a natural born pilot and getting the hang of the controls has been challenging for me, but it has been immense fun learning ""how to fly""."
RJSK8E6RH6HUL,"i would recommend this as a nice intermediate step towards flying the big remote control units which, of course, are several hundred dollars."
RJSK8E6RH6HUL,"the price for this is certainly right, you get a lot for what you pay."
R3D6FMB6UYR2SJ,the best part about this game is that it opens up conversations about other things with the people involved in the game.
RNU5XBAJEI9DK,i received these at a discount for my honest opinion.
RNU5XBAJEI9DK,this is a nice set of blocks.
RNU5XBAJEI9DK,a nice hard wood so they wont break.
RNU5XBAJEI9DK,my grandson loves them he has played with them from the time they got here only quit because of it being his bed time.
RNU5XBAJEI9DK,now if i can keep the puppys from hiding them.
ROXOYDDUFJCVM,"my sil actually got me the 300 piece version of this, and i love it!"
R2UXMMXNEB096Q,"nice napmins, just a little pricey"
R1UCDHBVY3PET,i will say that when i originally purchased this item my daughters 5 and 3 years old were thrilled with it.
R1UCDHBVY3PET,weve only used it a handful of times.
R1UCDHBVY3PET,"in that time i have repaired multiple tears, always along the seams of the plastic, inside and underneath the pool."
R1UCDHBVY3PET,"given the way that this product is made, the pool continues to leak because it has become impossible to find the source of some tears, most likely hidden with the many folds around the slide."
R1UCDHBVY3PET,do not waste your money.
R1UCDHBVY3PET,this purchase has been a huge disappointment.
R1TW8XT2D1G1XZ,"i love this so much, i bought it again!"
R2T4A1DC7YZX0D,thank you

R2G0VM9TSZ5ODF,"both batteries can use these portsproscharges all as neededlight indicator is awesomeconsou have to unplug the unit, plug the batteries in first then power the unit for the lights to show if charging or not.i am assuming that light on means it needs to charge and when the light goes off that means its ready.will do some flight tests later to confirm."

R1IXLOLYX1F4TW,my son had a great time digging out the bones and then putting the dinosaur together.
R1IXLOLYX1F4TW,"it is a bit messy, so put down a plastic trash bag and have them do it on the floor."
R1IXLOLYX1F4TW,"nice toy until its done, then it just becomes something that sits around."
R1IXLOLYX1F4TW,i thought about burying it in more dirt or sand so he could do it over again.
R1IXLOLYX1F4TW,that would extend its usefulness as a toy.
R229F3ZZKAO8H9,love polly pockets for my grand children.

R17QO9D7UJOPOW,as long as you position yourself and the object properly it really does create the illusion of a solid object.
RBSQBA5TR3UM,fell apart within a month after purchase.
RBSQBA5TR3UM,"my wife sewed up the seat part that rests on the bar on the bottom twice, then we resorted to duct tape."
RBSQBA5TR3UM,i dont think our daughter played roughly with it either!
RBSQBA5TR3UM,every part that is stitched eventually unraveled andor broke.

R39UY6LHFAT3EQ,he immediatly started playing with them.he had to show everyone.
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,for the money these batteries dont deliver what they promise .
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,"they require a large amount of water flow to work properly especially if you are using two or more at a time, you will need a dedicated water inlet to work properly ."
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,"i feel the discharge rate has been greatly exaggerated , i have 35c venom batteries about 6 months old that out perform these by at least 25  although they warm up a little under the same conditions ."
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,i think a trade off was made here with different labels and a 100 markup .
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,i have had trouble with the quality off materials used on the electrical connectors and corrosion under light use .
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,"these 50c batteries will stay cool but they take up more room and require a water redo, i do not recommend these batteries to anyone unless heat is a paramount concern , i would have been much better off investing in more research and less brand loyalty ."
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,i have been told that zippy brand batteries may be a much better alternative for price and performance .
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,"whenever possible read the reviews and shop different brands, unfortunately a newer product or limited selection may narrow your choices which asks the question why are more manufacturers not making this cost ?, consumer need ?"
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,gimick ?
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,.
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,good luck !
R2SYHU2XGE75JE,.

RPYKWKX6M1TVL,"its a great idea, my daughter loves it."
RPYKWKX6M1TVL,im going to purchase the little puppy for my other daughter today.
RPYKWKX6M1TVL,i do have just one complaint is why i only gave 4 stars.
RPYKWKX6M1TVL,the cloudpet sometimes has to shut off and turned back on to receive messages.
RPYKWKX6M1TVL,the toy will freeze up and make some weird noises.
RPYKWKX6M1TVL,once restarted it will work fine again.
RPYKWKX6M1TVL,not sure why this happens.
RPYKWKX6M1TVL,i still think its a great idea and my daughter loves it and the youngest will too once she gets hers.
RX6RC0V3JENU1,"the spray tube feature hanging from the rainbow sprays everywhere because it wont straighten out and the rainbow leans, but my daughter didnt care about any of that."
RX6RC0V3JENU1,i just didnt like being sprayed while i watched her play so i had to rig the sprayer to get it to stay down.

RO7OJYB058MQ5,"the charger works fine, as it is the one designed for the batteries ."
R3EZLJ2OUFJ2S6,my little granddaugher was just so so excited to open up her new chair and even she can carry 212 year old when watching her older brothers in their various sports.
R3EZLJ2OUFJ2S6,the only problem was the cup holder was a little small for the reusuable water bottle they have not the plastic ones.
R3EZLJ2OUFJ2S6,but overall just an adorable chair and very happy with my purchase.
R1S9LBFPQ3QY0W,my grandson love plush so much i can taken out of his hand.
R3E8DPFQ40K1FG,"i ordered by mistake, however decided to keep it because its so cute"

R2C1TJZHRIGNSI,"my neise loves it, she will start pre school soon."
RMUFY3JST6DXC,super cute!
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,this set is poorly designed junk.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,"the hockey puck does not slide on ordinary paved surfaces, nor would it work on grass."
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,useless.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,the soccer ball is pathetic.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,its basically a dog toy sold in a set for kids.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,you can get a much better soccer ball for children at any sports store.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,"as for the sticks and net, what you are getting is basically half of what you need to have any real fun."
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,"you get one net, and two sticks."
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,but there are four attachments for those sticks two hockey and two lacrosse.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,the attachments go on by way of a crude lockin system that requires pushing very gently on a button to make the attachments go on but that requires a very hard push to get them off again.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,my son and i could not get the lacrosse attachments off the sticks except by squeezing hard on that button.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,"unfortunately, one of the buttons was squeezed so hard that it went in and did not pop back out again."
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,now that stick is junk.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,we have just one stick now and its staying on its lacrosse setting.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,"youll need to buy extra sticks if you want to enjoy this set with less stress, so that your hockey and lacrosse sticks are ready when your kids are and dont need to be changed."
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,"but i wouldnt even bother buying this set for its sticks because they are made from clunky metal why not just get your kids the right sized, lowerend equipment made from wood or plastic and that requires no assembly?"
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,"the set makes enjoying sports horribly complicated.the net went together easily enough, but its not something id want to take apart and do over again each time they wanted to play."
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,so it takes up a large part of our basement.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,what i dislike most about the set is the cheapness of the materials.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,it has great gift appeal it was my preschoolers favorite birthday present and his 7yearold brother was even excited when it was opened.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,the picture on the box had my kids giddy to take it out right away.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,"but once we had it out, and realized how little there really was to play with, the qualityof which was all around inferior, our excitement waned and this toy will probably make an appearance in next years yard sale."
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,its a flashy toy with excellent gift appeal its best use is pretendplay for little kids.
R3QBU7VR4RQ1TT,but keep in mind it has all the caveats of a selfassembled toy.
R2WA04N834PKTO,skeleton does not laugh or light up as description says it does.
R2WA04N834PKTO,noticed there is a deluxe model maybe that one lights up and laughs but this one says it does and does not!

R3CDZYA5WH9620,"under the sun, it deflates, so not the best quality product around."
R3CDZYA5WH9620,"but considering its for a few mths if that during the summer, not too bad."
R2GVGUAKWM5SJ6,a number one.
R1409FMQTOF4CG,its exactly what it says it is.

RQ7MN4J2LTHYR,and it is big enough to fit a regular sized adult with infant!
R2FPIELJ0EDC1V,great value
RWSV858826A2Q,i would say this a a good toy for a very young baby  even an infant.
RWSV858826A2Q,"an older kid would probably be disappointed with it, especially if they expected it to smell like cotton candy."
RWSV858826A2Q,"it does smell, but only faintly and only for a short time."
RWSV858826A2Q,"he talks, but you have to press pretty hard.for these reasons i think its a good toy for a kid who is not expecting much."
RWSV858826A2Q,its still a funlooking guy.
RS06EI4F0O2DE,"bought as a present, did not play with it"

R1GAVY1O4PH0KF,it works as designed.
R1GAVY1O4PH0KF,just slip this thing underneath the cheerson mini quadcopter and youre good to go.
R1GAVY1O4PH0KF,"it lasted several crashes, but its not invincible, it will break eventually."
R1GAVY1O4PH0KF,"i tried to fix it, but i made it worse."
R1GAVY1O4PH0KF,get more than one.
R1GAVY1O4PH0KF,"after several flights, it will slip down so you will have to readjust before every recharge."
R1GAVY1O4PH0KF,it doesnt really protect very well if your quad decides to flip over upside down.
R1GAVY1O4PH0KF,this items ships from china so it takes a few weeks to get to you.

R2D8FX5T7J29IF,i was blown away by the speed the clean sleek look especially the chrome grill and play duration time.
R2D8FX5T7J29IF,the battery life over acceded my expectations.
R2D8FX5T7J29IF,ran circles around my red camaro concept rc which by the way suppose to hold more power than the fast & furious charger.
R2D8FX5T7J29IF,best rc car to own and add to your collection.

R36FAZ5U0QIMZ9,love the colors though i wish it was more vivid.
R36FAZ5U0QIMZ9,cant hang this high up or no one can see the details or the beautiful house behind the unicorn.

RKKLRPOPMKTDX,cant get close enough to the spot im working.
R3UBDN8H9D78Y1,my grand daughter collects each new ever after high doll that comes out.
R3UBDN8H9D78Y1,"they have encouraged her to read the three ever after high bokks by shannon hale, and if a doll can spark an interest in reading the money is well spent."
R3UBDN8H9D78Y1,darling charming is charming indeed from head to toe.
R2JQZ69K8JD0AF,good
R17K2JLID4LJRD,used for dock party  fun colors
R138AQFJNWKCXO,"nice card stock, laminated, no real need for sleeves since you dont need to shuffle them, but standard size cards that fit in standard size sleeves."
R138AQFJNWKCXO,"each spell is marked with the class symbol of who can cast the spells, but not enough to just add cards to the respective spell card decks."
R2KCTSA79KAEOD,"this figure only gets 3 stars.it comes with a comic book & a display standbattle accessory, which are welcomed bonuses.however, he really doesnt fit into his flight stand very well, and the comic book is just an old reprint of a rather boring story, starring torch.his wrists only hinge and bend up and down, but dont twist around."
R2KCTSA79KAEOD,"his hands are hinged, but he cant adopt any cool poses."
R2KCTSA79KAEOD,"torch usually has his hands open or fingers spread when casting flame, these poses arent possible with this figure.the figure is ok, but not as good as i thought from the display images."
R1THKGLB1J0RCK,very happy with it.
R16M2TKKLUNC2A,good
R3J89AKPD6EM7K,great as i expected
RY5M47QZWFSBC,kiddie pool was for family and kids.
RY5M47QZWFSBC,did not last very long  family threw it out after a couple of weeks useage.
R1O72QZYSZUP65,my niece and son love to put them together.
R1O72QZYSZUP65,it is even better because there are four instead of just one!
R3U3K8W9WRG357,nice color and printing.
R3U3K8W9WRG357,the reason i gave it 3 stars was because fabric is too thin and looses shape easily.
R3U3K8W9WRG357,my 2 year old liked it a lot though.
R29AH6TW0ARA38,really cool goku pop funko!
R3LRPP45OP6J2D,another present for a 2 year olds birthday.
R3LRPP45OP6J2D,keeps her busy.
R3J0DKHHYI0UNS,perfect for barbie andcosts a lot less too!

RZ2I56STXYCVW,very cute i cant wait to use them when our baby is born
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,this is one of the best green toys we have.
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,"we kept it outside all summer and not one bit of fading, breakage or anything."
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,my son now has it indoors to play with in the bathtub.
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,the cars have been put through all kinds or testing with a toddler and they dont have any knicks or scratches to speak of or see.
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,the boat is big and can be taken apart easily for washing if need be.
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,i have most of the green toys and have yet to be disappointed by any of them.
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,my son likes to put all of his toys on this little ferry and it holds a nice load.
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,the cars are the perfect size for toddler hands and are much bigger than a matchbox sized car.
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,"i highly recommend this over all of the green toys if you are getting your ""first."""
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,this is a prime example of how well they are made overall and what you will be getting if you decide to buy more.
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,my son uses his imagination with these toys more than any others out there.
R1CAOOWXYE5DFJ,"forget the toys that make noise, these will be played with much much longer."
RB3X1OPZT2BVX,thing are very small.
RB3X1OPZT2BVX,and the size of the stuff do not much the size of the containers.
R3L03IFVX37PVZ,good.
R15OD3HN2ZTNDU,cute action figure for a 4 year old to play with.
R15OD3HN2ZTNDU,well made.
R15OD3HN2ZTNDU,worth the money!
R6TEGPECE43DZ,fun to play

R3JKZHE146IL1F,love it!!
R3JKZHE146IL1F,!
RE7AVX776RRWL,this is a very cool transforming police car.
RE7AVX776RRWL,all little boys would absolutely love it!
RE7AVX776RRWL,"it transforms into a bionic bear, but you can also say that it is a k9 officer."
RE7AVX776RRWL,"it does it by itself, but i wish there was a way for a kids to do it on their own when they play."
RE7AVX776RRWL,the sounds are not very annoying and not very loud.
RE7AVX776RRWL,its really pretty average loudness.
RE7AVX776RRWL,"since its not very loud, it can actually be used inside."
RE7AVX776RRWL,ive seen a few similar toys that are way too loud to be played with inside.
RE7AVX776RRWL,it is a little smaller than i expected and i would suggest lowering the price a little bit.the bumpngo aspect is very exciting for all the kids.
RE7AVX776RRWL,my little nephew really loved watching it go everywhere.
RE7AVX776RRWL,this toy would be a great gift for any child who loves police cars.
RE7AVX776RRWL,i received a sample of this item for testing and reviewing purposes.
R1109SJ9CH2WD7,xmas gift
RUTD3U8FZ8ACF,not quality at all!
RUTD3U8FZ8ACF,but i guess i expected that for the price.
R2GOC9MKQSW1CV,would i spend the money again?
R2GOC9MKQSW1CV,no.
R2GOC9MKQSW1CV,"it took my 12 year and his father a long time to put together and the result was, well, kind of dull."
R32ABB88RP3L51,great!
R36VUI758YOXJQ,excellant
R1DDHDIB2B6HZD,excellent product and service.
RWD5TGEMHYNE7,i like it.
RWD5TGEMHYNE7,they are a bit small and you may bend some of them with your hand force.the manual is not very clear.
RWD5TGEMHYNE7,"it has small pictures with sometimes ambiguous steps illustration.overall, they are good and i like them."
R38N30VMNIOKQF,fun game but not one we are overly thrilled about playing.
R2VR4CDSGSWHWO,cute lil beanbun.
R2VR4CDSGSWHWO,its chain is easily broken though
RZP834PO94AA8,gave it as a gift
R19U5FJYBEBX2D,"purchased this item thinking i was going to get merida, once i opened the package i was surprised to find cinderella instead."
R19U5FJYBEBX2D,"this was unacceptable, as my daughter was expecting merida."
R2Q0NN69NA6LQX,bought these so we could start a family game night.
R2Q0NN69NA6LQX,lots of fun!
R2Q0NN69NA6LQX,great for my 5 year old son.
R16FMC0VPCPFFI,"awesome bumper sticker, its on my car and looks great."
R16FMC0VPCPFFI,1010 would buy again!
R16FMC0VPCPFFI,"i would love to see more versions of these, with different gravity falls themes."
R16FMC0VPCPFFI,i would plaster the rear of my car in them.
R1E8K7ULFMICED,the bluebirds love this house.
RYDII49DNIV1S,alright ill start off by saying i did pay full price for this item unlike many of the other reviews.
RYDII49DNIV1S,"with that said, this set came with multiple duplicates in the 100 which is fine with me, i mean i wouldnt expect anyone to have 100 non duplicate cards in any set and it never stated that there wouldnt be any duplicates."
RYDII49DNIV1S,i will say that i was extremely satisfied with my six reverse holos.
RYDII49DNIV1S,they were all rares and in great condition.
RYDII49DNIV1S,the cards span many different sets and i would say that this is a great clause for a collector or as a gift.
R3OETLTOJ3VS8T,my son got this for christmas last year.
R3OETLTOJ3VS8T,10 months later and he is still using it both for its geographical and nitelight capabilities.
R3OETLTOJ3VS8T,definitely worth it.
R3OETLTOJ3VS8T,lite bulb still going strong.
R3OETLTOJ3VS8T,zero complaints.
R3V0V9DQ88ZKYZ,nice
R2VWVT47AUTUT0,quality pruduct very happy !
R137WLZW6TPOPE,the idea behind this is better than the actual product.
R137WLZW6TPOPE,my son used it on my iphone 6. hes 11 years old and lost interest after a half hour.
R137WLZW6TPOPE,"the experiment book does have a lot of cool experiment ideas, but again, didnt keep his interest."
RF5IVB7NR9BRL,great game for kids!
R1HKDYJD643ELT,gave it for a gift so did not get to see it in action but the gift was appreciated.
RKOK9CVPRE0TF,my daughter has wanted this doll since last christmas.
RKOK9CVPRE0TF,when i saw that it was on sale i grabbed it right away.
RKOK9CVPRE0TF,she was able to play with it for a few days and really loved this doll.
RKOK9CVPRE0TF,its very cute and has a decent amount of interactions.
RKOK9CVPRE0TF,"unfortunately, not long after purchasing it, she no longer has any sound."
RKOK9CVPRE0TF,she still lights up and does everything else but no noise comes out of her.
RKOK9CVPRE0TF,we tried to google this problem and emailed the manufacturer to no avail.
RKOK9CVPRE0TF,my daughter is a bit heartbroken.
R1E1SFVIB5AABF,great
R1FGO2K1WBO0UF,jellycat are the best !
R19PQFZUTHJS7P,i am dissapionted with this whole purchase.

RGKIOQ7YVZ3DB,used for months with no problems.
RGKIOQ7YVZ3DB,"gives a couple extra minutes of flight time, essential for doing some shots from far away."
RGKIOQ7YVZ3DB,"limefuels customer service is excellent as well, i recieved a l54p doa and they immediately shipped out a replacement with only a 4 day turn around."
RGKIOQ7YVZ3DB,cant wait til they make one for the phantom 3
R10BRDDKHZM9V4,i thoroughly enjoy this game.
R10BRDDKHZM9V4,i can play it at family gatherings and not have to worry about offending my grandmother.
R4WOA0WOOC7BO,nice kit for a birthday party.
RY06BAIRPASGM,very cute!
RY06BAIRPASGM,not soft and squishy like some others i have purchased.
RRSGP1HE4C71V,"great product, came as advertised, shipped faster than id expected and it made a great gift!"
R1NIRRJUE4TT0C,4 year old grandson went crazy over this at his birthday party!
R1NIRRJUE4TT0C,fit perfectly and it will most likely be his halloween costume if he doesnt wear it out first!
R18I60JW35NE63,this is a very good lego figure of professor lupin!
R1MNPQZ69ZMUQ9,very nice!
R3MWZL5YCEH4OJ,its fine
R1V5I8W64XQA8R,my son received this as a gift when he was 9 months old.
R1V5I8W64XQA8R,"he played with it daily sometimes 30 min at a time until he was almost 2, when he graduated to a big kitchen."
R1V5I8W64XQA8R,"this was put away for a few months, but recently came out again now that his little sister is 6 months old."
R1V5I8W64XQA8R,"its one of the few things that they can really play with together, one on each side."
R1V5I8W64XQA8R,my son now 2.5 loves playing with it with his sis and she of course loves it too.
R1V5I8W64XQA8R,"we have a lot of toys, but this one stands apart as versatile, fun, and extremely long lived!"
R1V5I8W64XQA8R,it still looks brand new too.
R12FII42LT3DAG,total piece of junk.
R12FII42LT3DAG,that is not an hd camera.
R12FII42LT3DAG,"it does not even have an sd card to store the photos, you can only transmit them to your cell phone and the images are worse than 320x240."
R12FII42LT3DAG,in addition it does random 360 flips even though my fingers are nowhere near the button and ive tried several different modes to avoid this.
R12FII42LT3DAG,and the worst thing is that when you download their app on to your cell phone it includes a virus that you can only remove by going back to your cell phone vendor.
R12FII42LT3DAG,i almost feel like this is a product of the chinese military and is being used to infect peoples cell phones.
R12FII42LT3DAG,"whatever the virus is, it tried to gain access to my credit card numbers."
R12FII42LT3DAG,i dont think this is a coincidence.
R12FII42LT3DAG,i was attacked right after downloading their app.
R1IB6KFLRT3EXT,sweet
R1QCX1ZSP5EIDD,love it.
R1QCX1ZSP5EIDD,it is an awesome toy for kids
R2XKBR0VII887B,nice white base coating paint.
R2XKBR0VII887B,goes on really thin so the details of your mini stay.
R2XKBR0VII887B,not as good as the black version of this product however.
R2XKBR0VII887B,"be prepared to use several coats, unlike the black color which only took 1 on the same minis."
R33EDPLJV3XN7R,standard size cards with a light laminate that should hold up forever since you never need to shuffle them.
R33EDPLJV3XN7R,"much simpler than digging through the phb over and over, but spell pages for the longer descriptions."
R33EDPLJV3XN7R,"spell descriptions indicate all the relative information about casting time, range, requirements, and even concentration with version 2.we take the ready spells and arrange them by level, then place glass beads that represent the amount of spell slots we have next to them, different colors for each levels."
R33EDPLJV3XN7R,"as we cast a spell, we move a bead, and after a long rest we replace them."
R33EDPLJV3XN7R,"saves a lot of erasing, and weve all canged to this cardbead system."
R33EDPLJV3XN7R,"if you can afford all the niceties, this is definitely worth the small cost."
R3SR3K7QSAUS1G,"i was a little disappointed at how little they were, im going have to purchase at least 5 more time to get them to fill just the bottom of my ball pit."
R33BEATFTSJGXM,perfect!
R2RZ905JMJBTMU,sturdy.
R2RZ905JMJBTMU,efficient.
R2RZ905JMJBTMU,handy.these cards are great.
R2RZ905JMJBTMU,before i got them my friends would keep telling me to read my spells since i would make small mistakes.with these i have easy access to all the information needed and they are super sturdy.
R2PP92DEQ5ZYAX,purchased this toy for my neighbors two year old as a birthday gift.
R2PP92DEQ5ZYAX,it appears to work well.
R2PP92DEQ5ZYAX,hope she loves it
R1IBX90H6VFRS3,great!
R8RJALBHJJHIC,how can any 1 year old not love little people?
R8RJALBHJJHIC,"our son played with them as a toddler, so when his son turned a year, i knew exactly what i wanted for him."
R8RJALBHJJHIC,"sure enough, we have a second generation of little people lovers!"
R1TUCETH3Y9C3P,"great color, quality and size."
R1TUCETH3Y9C3P,just what we were looking for!
RQTGAFJ58ROVR,looks like elsa
R30HZ4H3OFUJ92,what a cool thing for a dimlylit party area!
R30HZ4H3OFUJ92,"the led lights change color and flash with changing frequency, so a lot of these in a room make a great effect."
R30HZ4H3OFUJ92,"out of 20, 3 didnt work  one didnt turn on, one had a hole in the balloon, one had a misformed balloon."
R30HZ4H3OFUJ92,"overall, though, for the price these are great!"
R1QOZS0DFT6IDW,this was a hit in my sons birthday.
R2G140WCD0C1HJ,"im attempting to use this on a kindle fire tv box with n64oid emulator, and there doesnt seem to be a way to get the cbuttons or the analog stick working properly."
R2G140WCD0C1HJ,"the cbuttons are not recognized, and the analog stick does not register as being fully tilted so things walk slowly, etc..if anyone has some pointers on getting it working thatd be great."
R2G140WCD0C1HJ,"seems to work on pc fine, but does not work in my current application so leaving neutral feedback."
R1LI2L3TUIOC9A,this was a birthday gift for my 3 year old.
R1LI2L3TUIOC9A,the tracks are great and you can do a lot with them.
R1LI2L3TUIOC9A,however the quality of the cars is very poor.
R1LI2L3TUIOC9A,the second day it quit working.
R1LI2L3TUIOC9A,the lights came on and the wheels spun but it didnt go anywhere.
R1LI2L3TUIOC9A,new batteries didnt fix the problem.
R1LI2L3TUIOC9A,he was very upset by it.
R1LI2L3TUIOC9A,im debating buying additional cars in hopes that this was just a lemon or looking for a different brand that might also fit on the tracks.
R3O7P6JZXDSL4J,this is one of the best figures marvel has put out.
R3O7P6JZXDSL4J,"aside from the usual highquality of the figure, the flaming skull is particularly cool."
R3O7P6JZXDSL4J,the flames are translucent plastic and look very nice.
R3O7P6JZXDSL4J,the skulls jaw moves and can open quite a ways you can see the flames through it.
R3O7P6JZXDSL4J,quite a neat little effect.
R3O7P6JZXDSL4J,recommend getting a jewelry chain or something to go with the figure for extra awesomeness.
R3O7P6JZXDSL4J,wish they had included a chain ghostrider could wield.rhinos has a leg in the box.
R2JQ5HJLJE1PR5,good product

RTAZPIN5MG13L,"when my wife told me that she wanted a ""spider swing"" for the swing set, i set out to find the best price."
RTAZPIN5MG13L,"folks, they dont give these things away, but this swing that i orders was the best price."
RTAZPIN5MG13L,"i reluctantly spent the money for this swing, but boy am i glad i did."
RTAZPIN5MG13L,the kids love it!!!
RTAZPIN5MG13L,the 3 year old has a great time riding on the swing with her 15 year old big brother.
RTAZPIN5MG13L,the swing was a huge hit.
RTAZPIN5MG13L,im glad i spent the money.
RUXGF22SJ2Y02,very small.
RUXGF22SJ2Y02,"i think it is cheaply made, ive had to reattach the hooks several time as they come off."
RUXGF22SJ2Y02,"however, my son plays with it all the time as a fidget toy, which it why i got it."

R3DG9FZX61TPPB,really cute.
R3KRHKB9J0VPIK,i have always been a fan of the original twister game since i was a child so i was excited to receive this new updated version with a twist!
R3KRHKB9J0VPIK,"my daughter, her friends and i had a ball playing this at her recent birthday party but only 2 people can play at a time so that was a bummer."
R3KRHKB9J0VPIK,the game is simple.
R3KRHKB9J0VPIK,you basically keep up with the beat by stepping on the colorful spots when lit up by the lights.
R3KRHKB9J0VPIK,"good coordination is required but its all in good fun!in order to keep up with your score digitally, you will need to purchase the twister moves tracker separately."
R3KRHKB9J0VPIK,this is a great game that will get and keep you moving!
R2RKE0FGHLDIR9,exactly what i was looking for and were delivered quickly!
R2RKE0FGHLDIR9,love them!!

R1T03DVPWUWZGJ,the whole container of 78 letters is only about 7 inches high.
R3U5AKWM9LFITM,fun for a while.
R3U5AKWM9LFITM,my son loved the idea.
R3U5AKWM9LFITM,the pretaped targets were place on the bathroom door.
R3U5AKWM9LFITM,you shoot them out of the slingshot at the target.
R3U5AKWM9LFITM,then go and pick it up to shoot again.
R3U5AKWM9LFITM,he played mostly by himself.
R3U5AKWM9LFITM,"my husband said his finger kept getting in the way as he shot it, but my son had to problems."
R3U5AKWM9LFITM,it comes with two airplanes and one slingshot.
R3U5AKWM9LFITM,"remember, whatever the target is attached to, it will take a beating."
R2M3JPFD41KBPD,really good deal for the price.
R2M3JPFD41KBPD,add a small quad tail rotor and it will move even better
R1PB7NS5LJUAI5,was not packaged very well and the sword came bent

R1HJ2PV8IXI1GJ,great quality toy to bring back the nostalagic memories
R1847BBGGRUXFO,my daughter had long beautiful hair and she got to were i could not do anything with it so we cut it really short.
R1847BBGGRUXFO,she is now into using bows to hold her bangs back.
R1847BBGGRUXFO,i thought these were really cute as she can use them and she can use them and the brush for her dolls.
R1847BBGGRUXFO,"the brush is made of high quality, it is just a miniature version of the brush we use for our hair."
R1847BBGGRUXFO,"the bows are very cute, i love the different color and designs they have."
R1847BBGGRUXFO,the clip is a alligator clip and is of good quality itself.
R1847BBGGRUXFO,the only issue i had with these were my daughter put one in her hair and took it out to adjust it and the bow fell off of the clip.
R1847BBGGRUXFO,so the bow was only used for a few seconds and broke.
R1847BBGGRUXFO,we were able to fix it with some super glue so we are still getting good use out of them and they are much more sturdier now with the super glue.
R1847BBGGRUXFO,overall we really like the set.i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
R1KTYL1XAMC39Q,we received this for a gift and it was in perfect brand new condition.
R1KTYL1XAMC39Q,we had to remove all the battery pull tabs on the little car.

R1UYPJZSJWFRCQ,way to go!
R397V3P9GL4BG0,just what i was looking for
R1GPI963LMIRLC,really thought we would enjoy this but i have to say that their puzzles in a box are better.
R1GPI963LMIRLC,once its put together and knocked over it has to be assembled again in order to be put away.
R1GPI963LMIRLC,i have put this thing together more than i would have liked to.
R1GPI963LMIRLC,"cute and good quality, though."

R2VFO788XKNO9G,my girlfriend adores it.
R19NN7VMFH415S,it would be a better product if they had a better storage box.
R19NN7VMFH415S,i wanted to use them for my student with low muscle tone.
R19NN7VMFH415S,"she has difficulty writing and i thought she could use the stamps, but it is difficult for her to take them out and put them back."
R19NN7VMFH415S,the boz should have more space and also label the areas where the letters belong with the letter name.
R2I6R2OGQJ7YTP,quite happy with this bubble blower.
R2I6R2OGQJ7YTP,first encountered it or one like it while on vacation in laguna beach.
R2I6R2OGQJ7YTP,succeeded in getting big bubbles almost 100 of the time  had to have one of our own!!
R2I6R2OGQJ7YTP,similar experience with our own at home.
R2I6R2OGQJ7YTP,the bubble solution that comes with it works very well.
R2I6R2OGQJ7YTP,wish it came with more more more!
R2I6R2OGQJ7YTP,a swordsworth doesnt last very long.
R2I6R2OGQJ7YTP,i purchased beeboo big bubble mix  that works well but maybe not quite as well as what comes with the unbelievable bubble.

R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,"i stumbled across this by accident, and although it seemed a bit pricey for only being able to make 10 images, i thought this would be a fun project for my granddaughter age 9 to work on over the summer."
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,"i guess these kits have been around for a long time, but somehow i never knew about them...i think they are a great idea, and i had fun, too!"
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,easy directions are on the back of the package.
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,the kit is simple inside of the package is the paper in a protective dark packdont let light hit the paper when taking out one sheet!
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,and a thick piece of acrylic to hold the objects to be printed flatthere is an adhesive sheet protecting it that needs to be discarded first.
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,"we simply laid a large, flat piece of cardboard on the lawn in a spot where there was full sun."
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,"for the first picture, she made a simple design from pieces of torn paper to make a floral pattern...she put the print paper on the cardboard, arranged her design on top, and covered it with the acrylic."
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,"it took about two minutes for the light blue paper to turn white and then she just popped it into a dishpan full of clean wateri know now that it is best to change the water after every one or two picturesand it slowly turned a dark blue, and tadaa!"
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,there was the image!
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,pretty!
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,"from there, she tried 3d objects without the acrylic sheet, of course and the one that turned out the best was a branch with fruitthe detail and depth came out great!"
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,"i didnt see any refills available for the same size paper about 8 x 10 but i was able to order a couple of 5 x 7 packs, so lots of opportunity to make more sun prints!"
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,"i think this is a great kit for elementary school age kids and im sure older kids could come up with some pretty creative uses, too but for more than one child, with only 10 sheets, i think it would be best to have a refill on hand."
R3QHLAG3IEG6VV,"in fact, if kids want to make sun prints with 3d objects, the kit isnt needed at all, just save some money & purchase the paper by itself!"
R1Q96SQYQIARPL,lots of fun.
R1Q96SQYQIARPL,would buy again.
RO0E2CRFS4TTR,very cute little favors
RIIDSDVRSTQIC,first quadcopter ive purchased and is really fun and easy to fly

R19647MMAV55ZQ,this table cloth really added to the party & looked great on the cake table!
R22RTW2CIEPHCB,i received quite a few of the swirls and very few of the hanging decorations.
R22RTW2CIEPHCB,very disappointed.
R28KCO58PKTDZT,got this to help our 27 month old granddaughter understand about plane rides.
R28KCO58PKTDZT,her first one is coming up in 2 weeks.
R28KCO58PKTDZT,she likes this toy.
R3MW97XPQ5662J,the child catcher comes soon vs swize
RDB10798GNL6G,rafts broke after first use.
R1JQCI9W6NFZH9,they seem just as sturdy as the rest of our magnatiles and definitely add to the fun of building for my icepalaceloving girls.
R1JQCI9W6NFZH9,i give four stars instead of five due to the value issue.
R1JQCI9W6NFZH9,the cost is high for only $32.
R1JQCI9W6NFZH9,"the 100 pack is a better deal, but these are unfortunately not available in the larger pack."
R1JQCI9W6NFZH9,if the company makes them available as a larger pack we would definitely buy them!
R1JQCI9W6NFZH9,for now though i would suggest buying the rainbow pack in the 100 size to get more bang for your buck and only buy these if you just really preference them.
RMIKY9Y932I6Q,the fur is a little thin in spots and came out when my grandson held him.
R3EIM86SCUN056,its a little heavy but my niece absolutely loves it!!!

R3KIM9V2VKWLU3,super cool
RDHS995U2DW41,recommended 100  excellent product
RVJO8T7B432KS,our dominoes two different sets and rummikub tiles fall over very easily when put on the racks vertically.
RVJO8T7B432KS,"they barely keep our dominoes up when laid horizontally, so theyre ""meh"" for mexican train."
RVJO8T7B432KS,"before pitching them in the recycling bin, our children discovered they worked well for holding cards, so maybe well use them for a card game like hanabi ... or holding up the mail."
RVJO8T7B432KS,"unfortunately we already have handheld card holders, we need a much better solution for dominoes."
R3806EPKFHRPIZ,"neat, but cheap plastic."
R30IC7RS2AXLWG,complete waste of money.

R2QHKEVROCP94I,some of the paint on the pieces came off......didnt like that much....washed and dried most.
RTAQ22ZGHUEA1,i should rephrase...my sons love this...i hate it.
RTAQ22ZGHUEA1,this was given to my oldest for his 7th birthday.
RTAQ22ZGHUEA1,it shoots and talks and makes a lot of noise.
RTAQ22ZGHUEA1,"to him it was the best present he got...and it was also the best present for his 3 year old brother who promptly tackled him for it, stole it and ran off."
RTAQ22ZGHUEA1,so we purchased a 2nd noisy raccoon to end the fighting.
RTAQ22ZGHUEA1,"now they fight their raccoons in an endless, noisy, where is the tylonel afternoon."
RTAQ22ZGHUEA1,they love it.
RTAQ22ZGHUEA1,"as long as the bedroom door is shut, its a great toy."
RTAQ22ZGHUEA1,perfect if youre purchasing it for a nephew that lives in a different state because you like to mess with your own brother or sister!
R2BVKC1ZUK0WJO,"some arrived broken, very slight sound"
RKLWGVPA2E18I,they are perfect for my son to make small buildings with.

R1BFKQ209ZA000,it is a good game of skill and coordination that takes them away from other digital gadgets.
R1BFKQ209ZA000,comes with an extra string in case one breaks.
R1BFKQ209ZA000,it is light and seems durable.
R1BFKQ209ZA000,my girls have fun playing with it and trying to best each other.

RPGZ2JV9WXLM7,"excellent product, thanks!"
R2YBWCTKQRS7LQ,just what i needed for a project.
R1YTH5CPQWOTRS,i purchased this item to highlight the few birds in this area.
R1YTH5CPQWOTRS,"unfortunately, the surrounding sounds interfered too much with the birds."
R1YTH5CPQWOTRS,i guess this would work much better in a lessnoisy area.
R1QK3WDMOY5W6N,great product!
R1QK3WDMOY5W6N,running a 3900kv on 3s lipo.

R3EXDH7LD0VBPA,he loved it!
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,i purchased the gocart as a christmas present.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,the only thing that required assembly was the rollover bar.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,"you have to install the battery, and drop in and secure the steering wheel...thats it."
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,it took more time to remove the metal shipping frame than the assembly would have taken.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,i ended up returning it without assembling or charging it.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,"it was missing the pin to secure the steering wheel, the gear knob, and some screws for the rollover bar."
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,the holes on the rollover bars were misaligned so they could not be assembled.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,"it required 2 different keys i received 2 of the same key.. i received 3 batteries with no explanation for receiving 3. the manual said there should be an accessorytool bag, but there was not."
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,other than that the manual was useless.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,"it was a bad photo copy, very poorly written and did not match the gocart i had."
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,i contacted the supplier about all the issues and the fact that the gocart couldnt be returned because of specialty shipping.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,they forwarded my email to the manufacturer.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,the manufacturer shipped the missing parts overnight.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,"however, they did not understand the misaligned screws on the rollover bars therefore they were not replaced."
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,i emailed photos of the misaligned holes on the rollover bars.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,while waiting their reply i decided to look up the co. on the bbb web site.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,there was one resolved complaint involving a request to return a gocart for a serious safety issue.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,"that information, along with the issues i was having, lead me to the decision to return the product."
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,"long story short, after really pushing the return issue the co., thankfully, allowed me to return the go art at their expense, for a full refund."
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,"i reassembled the shipping metal frame around the gocart, secured it to the frame and wooden pallet with the wires it came with."
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,i bought long thick plumbing tie wraps to tie down the box.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,i say all this to encourage you to keep all the packing material just in case.
R2S7ZSCEZH1MSG,i was delivered and picked up on an 18 wheelertransfer truck.
R392UE3JGE7E50,what i expected.
R1E0UH6XO3HTZA,i love this car

RGKPYVB23UGZW,it is ok.
R1OEPK5Z7Y3G8B,great!
R1OEPK5Z7Y3G8B,i liked building this puzzle.
R2DQ344HJMM0KF,my daughter got this for her second birthday and it was too short for her.
R2DQ344HJMM0KF,she still likes it but she gets tired of it quickly because she has to bend over to use it.
R2DQ344HJMM0KF,i will be buying her a new linger broom.
R6X79OJOUCBW4,made well enough but fairly.
R6X79OJOUCBW4,no accessories and a fairly bland costume.
R6X79OJOUCBW4,would have been nice if at least he was taller than the rest of the 6&34 line and perhaps more in like with hulk or thors height or maybe a bit more.
R6X79OJOUCBW4,"you can round out your avengers with him though.you will want ultrons leg however, as the end figure is quite amazing."
R3ER6SE9TBA00O,very good quality metal im very happy
RNHWGUS8WZ0F1,item arrived on time and was in good condition.
RNHWGUS8WZ0F1,quadcopter flew ok and all modes worked as described.
RNHWGUS8WZ0F1,in gps hold mode it drifts a little and i am not a big fan of the throttle control not being spring controlled back to the mid setting as is the direction aileron.
R1EGG7LGC1H9D6,great gift just as explained
RI2MT5T7SP0LU,i bought this as a present for my 2 year old niece.
RI2MT5T7SP0LU,"when it first arrived, the sound wasnt working properly."
RI2MT5T7SP0LU,i contacted the factory and they were quick to fix the solution!
RI2MT5T7SP0LU,even offered to overnight it to be here in time for my nieces party!
RI2MT5T7SP0LU,"they were very prompt and professional!once the new one came in, she absolutely loves it!"
RI2MT5T7SP0LU,she is able to get off and on by herself.

R1QQBNDHR5CVAF,quick shipping.
R1QQBNDHR5CVAF,very satisfied with item
R2LI2QNU3Z6ZAN,bought as a gift for my 4yr old niece and she loves it!
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,"i bought this to use as a water table for my son, he is 2, and he loves it."
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,i didnt want the ones that are actually sold as a water table because they have so much extra stuff along the sides of the table there is no room to play with the water.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,this is the perfect height for my son to play with.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,at first i thought it was not going to be deep enough for water play but when i filled it it was actually just right.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,a couple inches.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,it was extremely easy to put together.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,snap the legs into the table and done!!
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,no tools needed.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,i had my screw driver and mallet all ready!!
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,it was ready to be filled in less than a minute from getting it out of the box.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,i love it has a cover to so there isnt as much evaporation and no creepy crawlies are floating in it by morning.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,i have only left the water in a few days before changing it so it doesnt get nasty.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,my only complaint is water got down into the legs.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,there are little holes on the top of the legs just below the table itself.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,water would get in there even if we didnt use it as a water table.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,when cleaning it or if it rained water would still fill these little holes.
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,we just took a drill to the bottom of the legs for drain holes and the water came out!
RCOAPB7QQF6M5,we have had it for a couple months now and my son loves it.
R1P2EVZ4PT5JA8,"when i received my chalk, there was 4 usable pieces of white chalk and only 4 not broken in half or more of the colored chalk."
R1P2EVZ4PT5JA8,"i would not recommend this purchase based on the bad packaging, no way could the chalk survive."
R245PFLD8HI081,"although the box appeared to be new and sealed, there was no poster inside and the ""collectible"" cards were disappointing."
R1KFFURSBMRXIA,my family loves this game!
R1KFFURSBMRXIA,it is very funny and educational.
R1KFFURSBMRXIA,i play it with my 3 year old all the time and it is helping with her hand eye coordination skills.
R1KFFURSBMRXIA,"when playing with her, games dont last long but they are fun and memorable."
R1KFFURSBMRXIA,she loves when it crashes and we have to rebuild it.
R1KFFURSBMRXIA,i love that the box is very eye catching and that it is designed to be a template that makes restacking easy and fast.
R1KFFURSBMRXIA,my daughter also using the pieces to build with when we are not playing the game with them.
R1KFFURSBMRXIA,overall a great fun game that i highly recommend.
R1KFFURSBMRXIA,i received at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

RVE6W62LSN1LP,"this is a great strategic, yet fastpaced game."
RVE6W62LSN1LP,i wanted a strategy game that could be played with two players so we got ticket to ride europe.
RVE6W62LSN1LP,weve played it with 2 players and 4 players and have had fun with both.
RVE6W62LSN1LP,it is a beautifully constructed game board with really high quality game cards and pieces.
RVE6W62LSN1LP,the game feels fasterpaced than other strategy games compare settlers because each player only does one action per turn so there is less lag.
RVE6W62LSN1LP,it is fun and engaging.

R1E06F6J4W9ZHZ,good
R225SDU0BALS0A,this is an extremely affordable figure for what youre getting.
R225SDU0BALS0A,the sculpt and painting are detailed and precise  the figure i received had no real flaws to speak of.
R225SDU0BALS0A,she stands about 6&34 from the base to the highest tip of her hair.
R225SDU0BALS0A,one thing that isnt too clear from most pictures is that she does have a slanted fetal pose rather than an upright one.
R225SDU0BALS0A,"this allows her to be displayed very well from her left side or straighton, but her right side isnt really an option because of the angle  a potentially important consideration for your display configuration.there is some minor assembly required she comes in 4 pieces headhair, body, coralrock, and the actual black base itself."
R225SDU0BALS0A,"since the corals peg cannot be fully inserted except in the proper position, theres no way to assemble her incorrectly.overall, id say you couldnt possibly ask for a better figure at this price point, especially considering how expensive other princess shirahoshi figures are."
R225SDU0BALS0A,collectors rejoice!
RKXYFAGKSOY02,i read the reviews so i knew what to expect.
RKXYFAGKSOY02,my 7 yr old still loved it when i used it to decorate for her party.

R3A559D78D1UBH,"im 25 and i love my fuzzy sloth, my cat loves it even more, dragging it all over my house."
R3A559D78D1UBH,the only thing that i found a bit odd is that his fur is sewn in in some places hes got a bit of a bald spot on his head and has hard plastic as though it was melted.
R3A559D78D1UBH,"you have to pull really hard to remove the hard bits so i dont think its any kind of hazard, just a little weird."
R1F0O96XL5R3ES,grandson loves the truck even though the cans do not fit properly on the loading racks.
R1F0O96XL5R3ES,they fall off before moving the racks up.
R1F0O96XL5R3ES,i wish the doors would open too.
R1F0O96XL5R3ES,we found some guys to fit into the windows and we use balls of paper and dry beans for garbage.

R340A7LJ4KVQDY,"i bought these for my 3 year old daughter and i read the item description carefully prior to purchasing, so i knew i wasnt getting the full sized containers, but i thought i was getting the next size down."
R340A7LJ4KVQDY,"well, i was disappointed by how tiny they are."
R340A7LJ4KVQDY,"they are basically the size of the party favor playdoh containers, which to be honest, you cant make much with."
R340A7LJ4KVQDY,the item photo is quite deceiving because it makes the containers look larger than they really are.
R340A7LJ4KVQDY,"i couldve paid about 99 cents per container at walmart for the full size ones and only spent an extra $3 more than what i paid for these miniscule containers.i do like the assortment of colors you get green, blue, pink, purple, red, black, brown, yellow, orange, and white."
R340A7LJ4KVQDY,"though the playdoh provides hours of fun for the kids, just know that you are getting small containers for this price."
R2YIGX5NMYUF45,closest thing to s real lego youll ever find
R1O60JLYPYYLSD,kid loves it!
R2BSY6YUW4GMGY,"at least 3x bigger than most pop sculptures, this homage to one of the 80s most iconic movies literally stands above the rest."
R2BSY6YUW4GMGY,"the great detail of mr. puff, with the toasted detailing make him purely adorable."
R2BSY6YUW4GMGY,itll melt your heart like a smore.
R1E27LMVNFOWDJ,"my son has been riding it since he turned one, now turning two."
R5YVGCV9YZ0FT,very good battery.
R5YVGCV9YZ0FT,"our field is in the center of 640 acre corn field, so a powerout when flying is likely to result in long and difficult searches."
R5YVGCV9YZ0FT,"i fly a parkzone 48"" t28 with flight time of 12  15 minutes, and still there is a healthy reserve."
R5YVGCV9YZ0FT,i am very satisfied with this battery.

RFE5QZ9YNU81C,this blanket offers nice padding i would like more padding but this is good enough and pretty patterns.

R2DUCTWMYOQZRR,"when i first got mine, all the lights would light up when i plugged in 1 or 2 batteries."
R2DUCTWMYOQZRR,"however, when i switched to a higher capacity usb power source 1amp or greater, the chargers lights performed as they should."
R2DUCTWMYOQZRR,id suggest checking your usb power source and choosing a high capacity one.
R2DUCTWMYOQZRR,it will charge your batteries faster too!
R2DUCTWMYOQZRR,the charger seems to be working fine now...but ive only run a few cycles so far.
R2ZHC110YDJBMZ,a lot of playset for the money.
R2ZHC110YDJBMZ,plus it comes with some awesome characters.
R2ZHC110YDJBMZ,my only complaint is that kreo blocks dont quite click together as good as lego.

RO6PHUJ4P0I2Q,this game has really helped my 3yo with her number recognition.
RO6PHUJ4P0I2Q,"she could count, she could add small amounts, but connecting the symbols to a number value wasnt clicking."
RO6PHUJ4P0I2Q,"i am not the type to drill knowledge into preschoolers, so i was very glad that this game helped her learn it in a fun way!"
R21VYY3NR44A1I,"no matter how long you play, each expansion pack makes it even better!"

R1A3LADVWFWQOQ,a
RTTR9GRU0B9K1,ive had other shufflers but this one does the job!
R1BQZCSRTDZ8KV,the product that arrived did not look like the photo which clearly stated the figure was 12 inches.
R1BQZCSRTDZ8KV,false advertising!
R1BQZCSRTDZ8KV,"the actual product only stood about 6 inches high, was made of cheap material, and the band color was purple and flimsy."
R1BQZCSRTDZ8KV,not at all what i expected!
R1BQZCSRTDZ8KV,product also arrived several days late .... took over 6 weeks to arrive
RJOPEDNJC9PA2,just what i was looking for
RYGU197HNA35F,so cute!
R1EC7CGEK71XV2,this figure is so well done.
R1EC7CGEK71XV2,the colors in her hair make her stand out from the rest of the s. h. figuarts sailor moon collection.
R1EC7CGEK71XV2,"the figure i received was in perfect condition and has no defects what so ever, unlike one of the others i have purchased."
R1EC7CGEK71XV2,"the joints, arms, and legs have great articulation."
R1EC7CGEK71XV2,her hair does prevent the turning of her head to the left but that is nothing to be concerned about.
R1EC7CGEK71XV2,this figure is perfect in every respect.
R1GT42DYQZ0KIO,aaa

RFNYBB1MPPCOB,"youngfly 1 x touch learning machine toy,colors random is good toy,even its just a plastic box with a piece of plastic buttons but still works good the sounds is ok and they giving me a battery in the packaged too so that was great,just always remembered thou that dont expect too much about this product.i received this product at a discounted rate in exchange of my honest unbiased review."
R2LBW4EFXA8KEB,i used this kit along with a high temp soldering iron to repair some jewelry which would have cost a lot of money to have repaired elsewhere.
R2LBW4EFXA8KEB,the process was simple and the product worked great but i recommend using this in a well ventilated area as the flux smells really bad when heated.
R1AMKNGLTV2R3C,it was the birthday girl that turned 4!

R3U3BHL3Z5N3V9,plastic is scuffed and badly scratched.
R2VPYZTAEW8O1E,my kids loved them!
R2Q4YGAV3O4VSO,very disappointed with the quality of this item.
R2Q4YGAV3O4VSO,"it looked good online, but not in real life."
R9ANWDBY9IE4W,granddaughter likes tis a lot
R3FCT235NVHNSG,this is a great game for family and friends.
R3FCT235NVHNSG,i have introduced it to other seniors that live in the same apt.
R3FCT235NVHNSG,building and it is great for them as there is no need to worry about memory issues as can be the case with other card games.
R3FCT235NVHNSG,it also provides a way to get to know those that play with you and hopefully to to have a few laughs.
R3GB4M8I6LQNI8,we bought these as a joke at work for myself and other members of the team.
R3GB4M8I6LQNI8,"we have assumed ""alteregos"" with each pup and found ourselves giddy like kids over happy meal toys!"
R3GB4M8I6LQNI8,"the item is exactly as described and from a parents perspective, contains no small parts that would pose a concern."
R3GHEGKX907WU4,she loved it!
R1GSGXOWBGO05T,my 4 grandsons love this bubble blower.
R1GSGXOWBGO05T,i recommend this product for any bubble lovers!
R1COJAR5F448O,the product looked great in pictures and my son wore it out while playing robin.
R1COJAR5F448O,he ended up breaking it on the same day.
R1COJAR5F448O,it was great for the short time he had it.
R1COJAR5F448O,he still wears the glasses and he uses the r symbol as a back pack decoration.
RW7EUTGVYHCOU,love it
RKU0IYSJBH8Y2,great quality for the price.
RKU0IYSJBH8Y2,probably not authentic licensed product but it didnt matter.
RKU0IYSJBH8Y2,my kid loved it and it was super soft!
RKU0IYSJBH8Y2,its holding up after a lot of hugs.
R2Y6RN805JIEZQ,bought this and several others for positive reinforcement for my son to use the potty.
R2Y6RN805JIEZQ,it has worked wonders.
RJHMGM4Z1CJJ4,"assembly on the bow was a bit difficult to figure out, so i wish the directions were a bit clearer."
RJHMGM4Z1CJJ4,"once you bypass the assembly, the actual use of the loaded arrows was quite fun for the entire family, regardless of age."
RJHMGM4Z1CJJ4,the trigger worked wonderfully in dropping the arrows down to the barrel and all thats needed is to cock and shoot the arrow.
RJHMGM4Z1CJJ4,"the only part i didnt quite like was the quality of the string on the bow and the ""feathers"" on the arrows were too small."
RJHMGM4Z1CJJ4,"the small ""feathers"" on the bow often caused the arrow to flip 360 degrees sometimes and the back of the arrow would hit the target at times."
RHF5IBJ4RX8H7,i bought this costume for my 8 year old son and he really liked it.
RHF5IBJ4RX8H7,its made very well and is sturdy enough to where it made it through the gentle wash cycle without any mishaps.
RHF5IBJ4RX8H7,this costume is perfect for kids who want to be scary enough without over doing it.
RHF5IBJ4RX8H7,my son had no problems with being able to see out the mask during the day or at night.
RHF5IBJ4RX8H7,the costume does run a little long and only the very bottom of the costume would sometimes drag on the ground.
RHF5IBJ4RX8H7,"but even after a whole night of walking around, the costume remained in tact and the bottom hem had no rips or tears."
R1IERW7WIMO4FZ,my daughter loves this baby!
R1IERW7WIMO4FZ,so lifelike!
R1IERW7WIMO4FZ,she enjoys bathing and dressing her.
R1IERW7WIMO4FZ,she has a few pieces that had been her baby clothes and they fit this doll perfectly!
RMFCP5AIS08JI,high price
R23B4CZMNX2YC3,5 yo grandson loves these cards.
R2WX7SKBYTDNJN,this is our second set of mega hi tower.
R2WX7SKBYTDNJN,the first we received as a gift.
R2WX7SKBYTDNJN,the second we gave as a gift.
R2WX7SKBYTDNJN,the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that some of the pieces on the set we bought were warped.
R2WX7SKBYTDNJN,made the game a little more challenging.
R2WX7SKBYTDNJN,"not all bad, but not what we expected."
R2WX7SKBYTDNJN,fun game for all ages!
R13I7E5YY5IYE6,needed for a project.
R2LB8ZN030QBW3,"ive only used this for my sengoku red astray and wing fenice, they are quite thick and dry pretty fast, they are nothing like sharpies which you will see mentioned on here in reviews a lot, all of them are right, trust their judgement."
R2LB8ZN030QBW3,so be careful when you put this stuff on your gunpla.
R2LB8ZN030QBW3,once i get to using this more ill update this review and give a really thorough review of the markers for people who are new to painting or are a bit intimidated by painting gunpla like i was.
R1JOMO0V8QYYDK,i like so must this product.
R1JOMO0V8QYYDK,thank you.
R1JOMO0V8QYYDK,but i want to make same question only one armsbracomoved?
R1JOMO0V8QYYDK,please i wait you answer.
R1JOMO0V8QYYDK,thank you
R3G3QPWLI8TF25,the toyze red cartoon fire truck and toy fireman were a huge hit with my grandson.
R3G3QPWLI8TF25,there were two new toys side by side and he immediately before we told him they were there went for the firetruck.
R3G3QPWLI8TF25,it is basic enough for a young child he is four and rugged to hold up to the bumps and bangs that it will be going through.
R3G3QPWLI8TF25,the fireman he didnt really care about but it is a nice addition.
R3G3QPWLI8TF25,the truck has simple push buttons to make noise and comes with batteries.
R3G3QPWLI8TF25,"i received this at no cost in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
R2L4D0ITBA1DV2,i thought these were great.
R2L4D0ITBA1DV2,not much to it.
R2CVAXKOHG9418,perfect
R160RF2YY19M5J,"although this is not an ""official"" pok&eacutemon product, this umbreon plush is no doubt the biggest, cutest, softest, and best umbreon available!"
R160RF2YY19M5J,"it ""purrfectly"" depicts this beautiful lunar black cat, just as he looks in the pok&eacutemon games, with vivid colours, and spoton accurate details.you will not find a single identifying tag on this plush no hang tag or tush tag, as it is a custom pattern based directly on the awesome takaratomy small umbreon asinb00a84g21e takaratomy pokemon n47 umbreonblacky best wishes 8&34 plush doll plush pattern i have attached photos to compare the two  only expanded to two times the size!"
R160RF2YY19M5J,"it is a perfect replica of the real umbreon, accurately designed, and not one detail is missing.this umbreon is very lifelike, and large  approximately 13 inches tall!"
R160RF2YY19M5J,"he sits up on his own, excellently balanced, without any need for extra support, so you can easily display him on a bed, shelf, desk, or anywhere you would like.the materials used to make this plush are highquality."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"like other reviewers mentioned, this umbreon special in that the material used to make his fur is actually jetblack instead of the more grayishblacklooking shades used on some of the other umbreon plushies by takaratomy and banpresto."
R160RF2YY19M5J,the black &34fur&34 is also very soft and velvety to the touch.
R160RF2YY19M5J,"the circular golden markings on his forehead and legs are precisely embroidered with shiny bright yellow thread, and his catlike red eyes with slit pupils also masterfully embroidered onto the face, are piercing and intense, true to the real umbreon."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"he has a short feline muzzle with a tiny triangular black nose, and a cute little grin although these details are somewhat difficult to see at first, as they blend in with his jetblack fur."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"all over, his figure is perfect and accurate!"
R160RF2YY19M5J,"he is stuffed to purrfection, and although he is very lithe in shape, he is supersoft, squishy, and very cuddly."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"his rabbitlike ears are stuffed thickly, so they stand upright do not flop, and they have beautiful golden yellow ring patterns around them."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"the tail is the same, constructed and wellstuffed, just like the ears."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"his feline paws and feet are very beautifully detailed, with digits sewn in."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"his lovely detailed front paws are sewn together by thick threads, and i would not advise separating them, as it might result in damaging the plush.being an eeveelution fanatic and cat lover, i adore umbreon as well has his psychictype sister, espeon, and could not be more delighted with this incredible plush."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"he is one of my top favourites, and is always there for me to cuddle."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"he is perfect to snuggle with hugging a soft plushie comforts me and helps me sleep, and this umbreon has become one of my main cuddle buddies."
R160RF2YY19M5J,i call him &34phantom&34.
R160RF2YY19M5J,i ordered this beautiful extralarge umbreon plush from a very kind and honest seller on ebay.
R160RF2YY19M5J,"these extralarge eeveelution plushies are made in and sold from china, so it will take some time to ship, but it is worth the wait."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"again, this is not an official nintendo plush, but in my personal opinion it is actually better and more fairly priced than any official umbreon plush currently available."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"i have both the small takaratomy umbreon and the banpresto ""i love eevee"" large umbreon, but this umbreon is my favourite because it is so large and soft."
R160RF2YY19M5J,"it is a truly awesome size, durable, wellmade, and so cute!"
R160RF2YY19M5J,"highly recommended to children and collectors  and cat lovers, of course!"
R160RF2YY19M5J,"ike ears are stuffed thickly, so they stand upright do not flop, and they have beautiful golden yellow ring patterns around them."

R1Z9YPCDTSIMI,"it looked great before, though."
R1Z9YPCDTSIMI,haha.
R3ILJRZIGE5EPE,all products were more than satisfactory
RRD7NNG86BGRG,this is a great deal for the number of booster packs you get.
RRD7NNG86BGRG,i used 1 box for a draft and everyone got good cards and had fun
R1SCCCB9JDMS3Y,what can i say about this?
R1SCCCB9JDMS3Y,its olaf and hes adorable!
R1SCCCB9JDMS3Y,its from one of my favorite segments in the frozen film.
R1SCCCB9JDMS3Y,the seagull is adorable too.
R1SCCCB9JDMS3Y,so glad i was able to find it here.
R245KBY87B7TYH,its small.
R245KBY87B7TYH,"the handle to open the door is cheap, it bends and the door sticks."
R245KBY87B7TYH,its too hard for kids to open.
R5121IFTI77FC,"great quality, no perceivable imperfections, and the box is even durable if youre buying this to be a collectable."
R5121IFTI77FC,for a kids toy theyve got a good weight to them and i can tell that the paints not going to chip anytime soon.
R2SBW36V18JHCH,one of her arms fell off as soon as i took her out of the box.
R2SBW36V18JHCH,very cheaply made.
R2SBW36V18JHCH,was not impressed at all
RNLFYQSPLX8UY,excellent
R2FB6WI8RP12YO,the paper is too glossy and there arent very many sheets for the price.
R2FB6WI8RP12YO,i wouldnt buy again.
R11YX7FZGJGQTQ,"it came on time, its really cute but it was smaller than i thought"
R146K9U4YUGPO,cute game but the wood is very soft and breaks easily.
R146K9U4YUGPO,we broke a couple of noses just getting them out of the box.
RPNPT2X21AAH6,the balloons were really small and water leaked out while we were filling more balloons.
RPNPT2X21AAH6,waste of money!!
RPNPT2X21AAH6,"we refilled some of the balloons and the balloons wouldnt bust easily, kids complained they hurt too bad to throw at each other."
R10J1IKHT9SMQN,fun game!
R10J1IKHT9SMQN,my cousin loved it
R2PQ3J3HI1NQHE,nice
R24S8O75MHG55L,"great toy for people of all ages, as well as cats."
RIPV9QQZNQBI1,its fun if you really love the show.
RIPV9QQZNQBI1,its a little unorthodox so i probably wont play it regularly.
R10UB5H32VPRQS,"i love halloween, yet whenever i have an occasion where i need to wear a costume, i feel like i can never find anything or have a hard time coming up with something."
R10UB5H32VPRQS,this set is great because it is easily made into a quick and fun costume.
R10UB5H32VPRQS,"it is especially fun for me because i am generally viewed as the &34good girl&34 in my circles, so dressing the opposite is a blast."
R10UB5H32VPRQS,you can really do it up wearing all red or you can make it pretty simple.
R10UB5H32VPRQS,you can also dress conservatively or you can really make it sexy if that is the look you are going for.
R10UB5H32VPRQS,i like that such simple pieces can lead to such a versatile costume.
R10UB5H32VPRQS,the sequins add a fun blingy touch to the costume without being overboard and they stay put which is often an issue with sequins.is this the best devil costume out there?
R10UB5H32VPRQS,"no, but then again, you arent paying an arm and a leg for it like many of the other kits out there, yet it is still a nice quality."
R10UB5H32VPRQS,the only reason that i gave it four stars instead of five is that the horns are just a little bit floppy.
R10UB5H32VPRQS,"im not sure if every costume is that way or if something happened to mine during shipping, but it doesnt take away from the costume."
R10UB5H32VPRQS,"it still looks like devil horns.overall, a fun costume set that im glad to have on hand.i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and review."
R2XRJI76H8MAVX,great tire for any rcs which exceed 55mph!
R2XRJI76H8MAVX,use these on traxxas stampede and ruslters and provides unmatched street performance.
R2XRJI76H8MAVX,they are the only tire i have found which does not come unglued or explode once 60mph is exceeded.
R2XRJI76H8MAVX,the manufacturing of this tire and the treated foam material are what permits highspeed stability.
R2XRJI76H8MAVX,the only drawback is they wear down and can chunkup on rough streets and they are not good offroad or in wet conditions.
R2XRJI76H8MAVX,"that said, best dry street tire that can handle high speeds."
RSH946GEREUS1,fun gift for a toddler learning to walk.
RSH946GEREUS1,this worked for my grandsons first birthday gift  along with some play veggies and fruits to put in the cart!
R124BQDY2JFTX7,"this is the third wildkin nap mat i have purchased for my children to use in preschool, but the first easy cleantype mat."
R124BQDY2JFTX7,"while i wholeheartedly recommend the wildkin brand, i cant recommend the easy clean nap mats."
R124BQDY2JFTX7,they are made of a slick fabric that makes noise when you touch it.
R124BQDY2JFTX7,"my child loved lying down in the nap mat, but wouldnt sleep in it because he was too busy rubbing the fabric and wiggling in it, enjoying the noise it made and the way the mat slid across the carpet when he would move."
R124BQDY2JFTX7,i am sending this nap mat back.
R124BQDY2JFTX7,"for the record, though, i would absolutely buy one of the regular wildkin nap mats again."
R124BQDY2JFTX7,"they have lasted each of my two older children throughout their preschool years, even with weekly or more often washings."
R23Y3EMM3EXXSJ,worked perfectly on our power wheels atv!
RNAQ59GELLPMK,good
R1DYKS0YRVXYUK,have not bot them yet thay look like so much fun.i hope thay are but i fish the turret cud move
R3VZ9AIUY7NFGH,these are even nicer than i thought they would be  great purchase.
R3I8ZSV2AUHK5F,excellent game for a rising 3rd grader.
R3I8ZSV2AUHK5F,"she enjoyed it very much, and her ""multiples"" skills visibly improved immediately."
R1C21FJHYCVKRH,"my kids love this, but i do wish there was a volume control or at least be able to have lights on without the noise bc it is loud"
R22K2R4DIQEDL5,great game to play with friends!
R1MG1I5F1MH9ZN,fantastic for a first magic set
R2W04IMT7Y0U3J,got this for my friends 2 year old son who is starting to love planes.
R2W04IMT7Y0U3J,2 weeks later he still loves it.
R2W04IMT7Y0U3J,loves the engine sounds and was fascinated by how fast it goes back on the ground.
R2W04IMT7Y0U3J,great purchase.
R15DQT46LEQP0J,"very fun, but to complex for my three and five year old!"
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,this is definitely the next generation of toys.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,"and its definitely for &34children&34 8. i say &34children&34 because adults will love the cars just as much as 8 year olds.first off, you need a smartphone or other smart device to serve as the remote."
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,"for full compatibility list, visit ."
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,"but more recent iphones and android devices are included in the list.with the smartphone or device, you can choose the game that you want the cars to play and choose how and when they shoot each other and which weapons they use."
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,youll also need 8 aa batteries.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,i suggest that you use rechargeable batteries.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,"i tend to recharge the car batteries when i recharge my cell phone, and i havent run into low batteries at inopportune times by following that routine.you end up controlling one of the cars and the other car automatically responds to the car youre controlling."
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,its like a live video game.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,so you dont need to control the second car yourself.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,i read that gps tracking technology allows the second car to follow the first.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,"not only does the second car follow the first, but it shoots at it and tries to &34destroy&34 it."
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,so you need to make sure that your car wins the game.you can play the game on any floor surface.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,"the cars, though, move fastest on smoother surfaces."
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,"luckily, they didnt scratch my floors.finally, you can buy accessoriesif you want."
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,you can buy ramps.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,you can also buy additional cars.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,i read that you can have up to 50 cars playing the game at once.
R325UZRX4Y8KA4,"im not exactly sure how that works, though."
R2R74P4QXFFUWG,i thought i was ordering a real cat.
R2R74P4QXFFUWG,"i was disappointed, distraught really, on the verge of inconsolable when the plush arrived."
R2R74P4QXFFUWG,"then i realized this thing didnt poop, require food, and resent me for being involved in its existence."
R2R74P4QXFFUWG,yay cobbler cat!
RP8EFJOY722SK,if you have a preschooler then you know that the last thing you want to find is marker on the wall or stamps all over the closet door.
RP8EFJOY722SK,this line of products is for you.
RP8EFJOY722SK,weve bought several things from this line so its nice to see a new product.
RP8EFJOY722SK,this set contains ocean themed stamps and paper.
RP8EFJOY722SK,"if you are looking for a more creative spin on a birthday or holiday gift, this is at a great, fun gift at a good price point!"
R1088F1SZAZQ2W,"what can i say, this is one tough looking dragon!"
R1088F1SZAZQ2W,his snarling face looks like its ready to spew fire at any second and give you a nasty swipe with his claw at the same time.
R1088F1SZAZQ2W,the horns are pointy and barbs run along his back all the way to a vicious looking barbed tail.the detail is superb and the paintwork is spot on.
R1088F1SZAZQ2W,"this is a nice heavy duty toy, that looks like it can stand up to hours of play no problem, then be displayed at a later date and look just as good."
R1088F1SZAZQ2W,great choice for the dragon lover!
R2G1AHVT0PQG8J,"beautiful, my daughter is happy with it"
R2KF8SWN1QMXZE,just one of those models you cannot resist.

RRIOFJDPL3E20,kids will love the wizard in this.
R2VKEW3O9W85LI,lovely little diary for a 11 year old girl
RJWDVVDVE1OTO,all the materials were lovely.
RJWDVVDVE1OTO,"after baking and storing them for a few days the paint on outside of bowls seems permanent, so far."
RJWDVVDVE1OTO,all the paint on the inside of the bowls came off when washed a few days later.
RJWDVVDVE1OTO,i dont know if the instructions were weak or we did something wrong.
R2JH8PL8NOZHOZ,people who like to personalize their crayons are likely to enjoy this crayon carver.
R2JH8PL8NOZHOZ,"it does work and my children customized a number of crayons with just a little of my help, mostly removing stuck tiles.the crayons have to be the correct length, which is new or almost new."
R2JH8PL8NOZHOZ,"they have a crayola crayon maker but, unfortunately, it produces crayons that are too short to be used in this carver."
R2JH8PL8NOZHOZ,"it would be better if this could carve different length crayons.from my limited usage, i would give it four stars."
R2JH8PL8NOZHOZ,my daughter rated it three and a half stars.her reviewthis is really fun.
R2JH8PL8NOZHOZ,it doesnt require you to handle any sharp objects to cut shapes into the crayon and the result is nice.
R2JH8PL8NOZHOZ,"however, some of the designs are unclear and certain tiles got stuck in the slots i could not pull them out."
R2JH8PL8NOZHOZ,"the wrapper ripper works okay, but it causes an unsightly line to be carved into the crayons side."
R37WALNA6LFKO0,"if your kid loves the movie, cant wait for the cartoon and 2nd movie, then they are going to want these dolls."
R37WALNA6LFKO0,"im thrilled the 2 piece set is cheaper than buying individually, but i was hoping they would have some accessories, like from the movie."
R37WALNA6LFKO0,"at $30 i was also expecting a better quality doll, with each having more movement."
R37WALNA6LFKO0,not sure why one out of the set has more evie than the other.
R37WALNA6LFKO0,"but, you are getting a fan item, so there are some things as an adult, you can overlook, as your kid wont care, theyll be thrilled to have evie and carlos to play with!"
R37WALNA6LFKO0,"this is a fun set, and perfect for surprising your kids with!"

RKDQ2HT22LH2W,"the size was just right for her, shes 4."
R37R4R4T8C5XAS,"sometimes i question my love for figures, but this ganondorf statue makes me realize that it is always worth it."
R37R4R4T8C5XAS,"he is beauty, he is grace, he is ready to smash you in the face."
R37R4R4T8C5XAS,"i get the pleasure of allowing my eyes to gaze upon ganondorf and all his detail and i feel a sense of relief, everything will be ok, he is here and he is powerful."
R1EMV4MB6YLAPL,love the game.

R2IY7PZ9UQN7TS,good item to learning
R2YZLD5SYNQT3M,worked sort of.
R2YZLD5SYNQT3M,the idea of it was better than the follow through.
R2YZLD5SYNQT3M,will not keep air.
R2YZLD5SYNQT3M,only used it on one vacation and had to blow it up each time i would take my son in the water.
R2YZLD5SYNQT3M,pretty annoying.
R2YZLD5SYNQT3M,but i was holding him the whole time so it was just as precaution anyways.
R3TTDL4C5WXPBX,our grandson is enjoying the meccano.

R3PLZK85GGW30R,the only issue is that the material is a little stiff.
RTNVTIAXKKZ84,product was not liked at all by my little 2yr old niece.
RTNVTIAXKKZ84,waste of money.

R3AXN4XNELNFJR,my grandchildren used these to make christmas gifts for their parents.
R3AXN4XNELNFJR,great craft and useful too.
R10OCMMIPRPSEL,this was ok it had some seams that were not sewed and leaked air.
R10OCMMIPRPSEL,i already threw box away so i fixed myself no problem.
R10OCMMIPRPSEL,kids ask to play on it every day would be five stars if quality was better.
R10OCMMIPRPSEL,good buy ig others dont have issues.

R1UDQRJNIAKRWO,thank you.
R2DNXDFVU6SJ3O,love it
R2UEAYNN8NP5PP,my kids did this as a surprise for mothers day and then we used another one for grandmas birthday.
R2UEAYNN8NP5PP,they loved it each time.
R2UEAYNN8NP5PP,we have been using two vases to put flowers for 6 months and paint did start to chip off a bit.
R2UEAYNN8NP5PP,we decided to put dry flowers in them.
R2UEAYNN8NP5PP,"there was more then enough paint for 3 vases, even have some left."
R33UHYO9A1WTX8,i bought the full chart for my kids but being that theyre different ages i needed different supplements.
R33UHYO9A1WTX8,"i give these packs a ""meh"" a lot of the items are repetitive, and i find it irritating that i had to buy two different packs just to make the chart work for ages 3 and 7. they would be doing well to make a family type pack that has stuff like ""do your home work"" then a few chores for little guys and a few chores for bigger guys."
R33UHYO9A1WTX8,i know you can write your own but i wanted the pictures for the little one to have something to equate with a star at his level.
R33UHYO9A1WTX8,over all though its a good system.
R32TBMXNFQJEIL,absolute crap.these are the tiny ones.
R3IOHASTYSBHW8,"cute, and will show well when the cowardly lion receives it."
RUTGN9BKDQPXJ,"really easy, peaceful build to get done, i finished it in about two hours."
RUTGN9BKDQPXJ,"theres not a whole lot of special stuff here, but the articulation is fantastic as usual."
RUTGN9BKDQPXJ,buying this will get me in to the 00 series and definitely peaked my interest in the gunpla!
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,i was surprised when this arrived because it is much bigger that i was expecting.the miles from tomorrowland stellosphere falls into the category of imaginative play for space lovers who watch the disney junior series.not familiar with the series?
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,miles from tomorrowland is an animated space adventure series.
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,"it centers on the callisto family who live on a spaceship called the stellosphere and work for the tomorrowland transit authority tta.from the description, &34the stellosphere comes apart into 3 separate ships to make space explorations easier."
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,open up the large stellosphere playset to reveal the callistos command center where miles and the callisto family figures sold separately can receive missions from the tta.
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,"for short, quick missions, take the mini starjetter that is stored in the stellosphere."
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,for longer missions that require a greater distance to travel take the zip ship that can be removed from the top of the stellosphere.
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,"to boost any ship with lights and sounds remove the xvr system from the bottom of the stellosphere and attach to the other ships.&34first, the stellosphere requires 3 aaa batteries which are included.there is one poseable miles figure included."
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,miles is an enthusiastic and curious boy with a somewhat reckless inventive streak whom the series is named after.the stellosphere has a lot of features.
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,"it has lights and sounds plus phrases from &34miles from tomorrowland&34.i think this is a really fun and imaginative concept  the ability to detach the ships is a great feature, especially when multiple kids are playing.i am very happy with all aspects of this item.there is a play set of other figures but they are stuck to little platforms and not as poseable as miles from this set."
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,other action figures from this series do fit  match.
R3KQCEL3LWJ1MK,there are also companion toys that go with this stratosphere for the real miles fan.
R25ZK5KB1MUMB5,after spending $350.00 on this discontinued set.
R25ZK5KB1MUMB5,lego rereleased it for $99.00.
R25ZK5KB1MUMB5,just let that sink in.
R1NPYW3M58N7N6,my son says it is so awesome.
R1NPYW3M58N7N6,it has lots of wires and it has a motor and a pin wheel.
R1NPYW3M58N7N6,it works with one d cell battery.
R1NPYW3M58N7N6,my son is 4 years old and wants to play with his experiment all the time and wants another one.
R1NPYW3M58N7N6,we just ordered the chemistry experiment.
R2FY2TKWSJ1QPQ,2 yr old niece loved it
R2CG5K0W4Y7OPO,this is exactly what my daughter wanted for her dollhouse and i cant wait to give it to her for christmas.
R2CG5K0W4Y7OPO,"sadly, when it arrived, it dont light up or make any noise like it is supposed to.since it is for christmas, i am not even the slightest but annoyed."
R2CG5K0W4Y7OPO,amazon is always so easy with replacementsreturns etc.i know my new and working one will be here very soon.
R25CE48CXSUERZ,dolls are beautiful but some of the packages were damaged .never received signed autograph of johnny depp ups lost very disappointed.
R34QTH76ALM2NU,nice
R195Z0RYR3FFN1,it was saggy and easily popped
R323UOKT7QRH46,this is super tiny.
R323UOKT7QRH46,the cups are about 1.5 inches.
R323UOKT7QRH46,i should have looked at the measurements before i boughtthats on me.
R323UOKT7QRH46,it is cute and colorful.
R323UOKT7QRH46,i like that its wood and not plastic and my son seems to enjoy it.
R323UOKT7QRH46,hell outgrow it quickly not sure its worth the price.
R21W099Z39Y5VL,this doll is absolutely gorgeous.
R21W099Z39Y5VL,the box and graphics make an impressive presentation.
R21W099Z39Y5VL,the accessories included have a great amount of decorative details.
R21W099Z39Y5VL,"the clothing is well stitched, not basted."
R21W099Z39Y5VL,"and she seems to be constructed to last for quite some time cant say the same of some other dolls weve purchased recently from ""ever after"" which fell apart the first day."
R21W099Z39Y5VL,"most of the dolls we have gotten from other brands cannot be posed, or only move one or two ways with visible joints."
R21W099Z39Y5VL,these are exceptionally well done.
R3HU1OQ8A17P47,works as expected.
R16X2OAYPWLGN2,this case is a perfect fit for the syma x8c or the x8w.
R16X2OAYPWLGN2,"there is plenty of space for the drone, blades, extra batteries, the controller, charger, tool kit, extra camera, etc."
R16X2OAYPWLGN2,this case is not a heavy duty case and definitely not for checking in on a plane but will ensure your drone is safe on road trips.
R16X2OAYPWLGN2,"the case has a nice black glossy finish, locking clasps, and a nice handle."
R16X2OAYPWLGN2,this will definitely keep your x8 safe on trips and looks really cool when you carry it and set things up.
R16X2OAYPWLGN2,"for the price, i highly recommend it!"
R3MENBXUZ5E8JH,very nice
R1AL4EFQRFTVMB,"good quality, kids love it!"
R2NSZ7KOIT6ZCE,my son loves this and it is big enough to grow into.
R1JKO7NZAG5EPT,very poor product.
R1JKO7NZAG5EPT,getting the handset to talk to the drone is problematic and the instructions written in very bad english.
R1JKO7NZAG5EPT,avoid
RRCARE93B9B0Z,bought the full chart and then this for our 2nd child.
RRCARE93B9B0Z,ours are 7 and 3 so i knew we wouldnt have cross over chores so having a cheaper option with less fluff was a great alternative.
RT9HG8M6DQQA2,very motivated 6 yr. old lego geek absolutely loves all the lego star wars.
R2CH4QFDX56G45,wellloved still at one year old.

R26Z3K9RHLZ91W,great game for young word lovers.
RT8JSRXOXCDXW,all was good
R2S5KO39DXGZP3,ive had the same tube in the trunk of my car for over 5 years now and its still going strong.
R2S5KO39DXGZP3,i bought some new ones just so i could have extras and theyre still well made and work perfectly for tubing down a river.
R2S5KO39DXGZP3,these are really well made and are very comfortable.
R2CAVPR1Q9X2N9,just as described.
R3IYK4MD1EVKC9,"samurott is handdown my favorite water type pokemon and my alltime favorite pokemon, and i have chosen oshawott as my starter in black 1 and white 2. i have some other samurott cards, but i like this one the most."
R3IYK4MD1EVKC9,the drawing is very well detailed and astoundingly beautiful.
R3IYK4MD1EVKC9,this card came pretty fast like the other cards that i ordered with it.
R3IYK4MD1EVKC9,i am very pleased with this card!
R4WGO3AA905YK,adorable costume and true to size except for the bandana it was way too big but very poor quality.
R4WGO3AA905YK,the whole back of the shirt ripped out as i was putting it on my daughter for the first time.
R3T72F6HAKZXJ7,this is a great swing for outdoor use.
R3T72F6HAKZXJ7,it has a padded outer ring and a flat rope netted platform for sitting on.
R3T72F6HAKZXJ7,it can hold 2 small children or 1 large child.the swing requires some assembly.
R3T72F6HAKZXJ7,"specifically, you must put secure the 4 pieces that make the circular frame into a circle and screw in bolts hold them together."
R3T72F6HAKZXJ7,it was pretty straightforward to do.i recommend this swing for kids old enough to swing without a seatbelt.i received this product in exchange for an honest review.

R17C3MEYEW0MNN,these are exceptionally well done.
R21VJJ8MTH0Y1W,these new factions are absolutely incredible and allow for some very nice combos with the other factions of smash up.
R21VJJ8MTH0Y1W,i wont go into too many details about combinations but this pack is definitely a must have for anyone that likes to play smash up.
R21VJJ8MTH0Y1W,"the cards are also very cute and while they are based on popular media, have a good amount of humor mixed in with them."
R21VJJ8MTH0Y1W,its worth it to read through all of the them and get a laugh.
R2TQAYOQD6EUX4,very cute loveit!
R1JHM47J1Q9BJU,this book and raccoon helped my daughter with starting school.
R1JHM47J1Q9BJU,we have the kissing hand tradition still and she is in 2nd grade.
R1JHM47J1Q9BJU,dont know where this little guy went but the story and meaning stuck with us!
R3TXYKKUH0XPLL,just wonderful!
R3TXYKKUH0XPLL,the 2 yr old recipient immediately began playing and creating stories with this train.
R3TXYKKUH0XPLL,great size for toddler hands.
RWQU8U3P409NX,this kitty is positively adorable!
RWQU8U3P409NX,"very soft, very well made, just what i had in mind as a gift for a ""cat person"" i know."
RWQU8U3P409NX,"she is so cute i might have trouble giving her away  might have to order another, that face almost says ""pet me!"""
RWQU8U3P409NX,"she is 12"" long as advertised, bigger than a kitten but smaller than an adult cat."
RWQU8U3P409NX,"she is about the size of an ""adolescent cat"" at about 69 months."
RWQU8U3P409NX,"she is posed as shown, perfect to pick up and hold or perch on a raised surface so she can survey her domain."
RV12MS97H6UY,"they filled up nicely, however they didnt hold the helium very well, after about 6 hours they were shrinking and falling to the floor, wouldnt recommend them for a long event."
R3E9SDQ54SLDLP,love these puzzles.
R3E9SDQ54SLDLP,great quality
R1H5TXPV7PPUXO,my sons kindergarten class thought these were so cool!!
R1H5TXPV7PPUXO,bought them as back up for the teacher because you can never have enough to just toss away!
R1H5TXPV7PPUXO,!
RMSBKEARLLPVK,there is no way this is a 10x magnifier!
RMSBKEARLLPVK,what trash.
RMSBKEARLLPVK,the package doesnt even indicate magnification.
RMSBKEARLLPVK,dont waste your money
R26B2728SCWBDL,the kids enjoyed the kit.

R3AGBBO6GGD42L,my nephews enjoyed this.
R33HGF4QL8NG1X,worked as advertised!
RKLBXJEQ1N55B,i love the detail.
RKLBXJEQ1N55B,"the whistles, patches, and ""police"" on the back."
RKLBXJEQ1N55B,kids love it too.
RKLBXJEQ1N55B,better quality than i had expected.
RKLBXJEQ1N55B,"i did say that it is somewhat large, but then again my kids are little smaller than average, so it may actually fit as expected."
RDOOVBN1RDAAC,does not fit!
R21WMVMXFJQ690,very nice to do
R3LRN2NIZU7385,belle objet de collection!
RW6MHXZ1WZG8X,missing parts.
RW6MHXZ1WZG8X,the last set i got had broken parts.
RW6MHXZ1WZG8X,very poor quality assurance.
RW6MHXZ1WZG8X,fun toys tho.
R4MXPBT715K6N,my daughter was very happy and excited because it made her drinks a slushy.
R31V99DN3EEA14,pros its a slinky.
R31V99DN3EEA14,the threepack does contain three separatelyboxed slinkys.
R31V99DN3EEA14,it will go down stairs if  the stair tread is not toowide and if there is no loose pile carpet.
R31V99DN3EEA14,"generally, this slinky cantmake the leap far enough out to continue and it tends to catch onthe carpet fibers."
R31V99DN3EEA14,"considering the $1.00 price back in the 40s whenslinky was introduced, the $10."
R31V99DN3EEA14,"price for three is not outofline.cons this new &34original&34 slinky is not like the original &34original&34.although the box says it is original, the 1945 version had a totalof 98 coils, this one has only 72 coils."
R31V99DN3EEA14,that rather severely limitsthe &34action&34.the size of the present &34original&34 is 2 34&34 diameter x 2 116&34tall.
R31V99DN3EEA14,"held by one end and suspended, it stretches to 43 inches.its not the same as the inventor designed."
R31V99DN3EEA14,shame.
RMQJ44XL8LEOT,the body of the ball link is longer then the existing ball links they replaced.
R1LIG870RLDM3F,just what i wanted.
R3AT1XANDSTDY2,"my nephew loved them , he is a bid dinosaur freak and plays with them all the time and i bought these for him, to keep him busy and from what i have been told , he hasnt stopped playing with them and he has had them for 2 weeks not"

RIQ9CWDCX9J7L,"for anyone who has a titanic collection, it is worth getting.. its a cool item to have."
R296JFTRJ4BIQ2,very good
REGNZHJOP9ISF,"even though the doll has &34my 1st doll&34 printed across her top, we decided to give this to the four year old girl we frequently babysit my gfs grand daughter."
REGNZHJOP9ISF,"she already has a lot of dolls, but whats one more?"
REGNZHJOP9ISF,"she loves playing mommy, pushing a stroller around the park, feeding, etc."
REGNZHJOP9ISF,we recently picked up a doll carrier  and this doll is the perfect companion for that.needless to say she loves it.
REGNZHJOP9ISF,"we were hoping the doll would stay here  nope  shes taking her home.the doll is soft, plush, washable and can go anywhere."
REGNZHJOP9ISF,her plush pinkie pie gives the adora doll rides.
REGNZHJOP9ISF,just saying.great gift for any young girl!
RGO40MY4LHN50,really excellent costume!

RYVYF3HMW63OP,still trying to figure out what all of the toppings are in the mold.
R24L1T89M84WGR,awesome set
R3KWCSL630IRAL,amazing figure worth every cent
R3L82ST364ND9C,i bought these for my toddler grandson and was disappointed.
R3L82ST364ND9C,they are not made of the same sturdy plastic the ones from years ago were made of.
R3L82ST364ND9C,the plastic is softer and thinner.
R3L82ST364ND9C,some of the barrel halves fit together loosely.
R3L82ST364ND9C,there is not that satisfying click when fitting the halves together.
R3L82ST364ND9C,"also, there are only four barrels rather than the traditional five."
R2LCVTDELRGHTP,our family went to a themed wedding with this costume.
R2LCVTDELRGHTP,i was expecting a cheaply made costume with a one time use.
R2LCVTDELRGHTP,i was happily surprised!
R2LCVTDELRGHTP,"although it is made with lower quality materials, i have been able to wearloan this costume 4 times now and there is no damage!!"
R2LCVTDELRGHTP,!
RE3X3HSEMJVRX,exactly as the picture showed very pleased
R3HCV6A7A4WZNI,received broken piece
R3210CGPQE4R0O,"overall, i think this product does what is advertised."
R3210CGPQE4R0O,i received this product from bzzagent.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,my 8 year old had it opened and assembled almost immediately.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,i decided i would give it a try before i let her have it since the odds were good that she would need a little help.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,i do not sew or knit or really have a desire to do either so this is not a natural task for me and my first attempt at using this product showed it.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,"the instructions were difficult to follow even with the colorful pictures again, i am completely incompetent at anything sewing or knitting or related."
R3210CGPQE4R0O,i put it away after frustration set in and tried it again a couple days later.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,the 2nd attempt went a little better.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,i obviously did not catch that each project called for a certain pole size but finally realized it several stitches into the project.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,so on came round 3. round 3 had much better results although it was definitely a &34first attempt&34 looking project.as for the projects.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,the project that we have completed so far is the headband.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,it turned out okay but it was way too big using the instructions provided.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,"i would recommend about 34 of the way through to start gauging the size so that you will actually be able to use it.in regards to the product design, i liked it and so did the 8 year old."
R3210CGPQE4R0O,all of the posts store nicely into the base and everything seems to have its place.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,the one thing that we didnt understand though is why the smallest of the posts were provided.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,none of the projects call for that size post and there is really no explanation as to why you would need that size.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,i can only assume that maybe there is extra yarn with extra patterns or something that you can buy that would use them.
R3210CGPQE4R0O,"otherwise, they seem useless.this is a product that i would have seen and immediately knew that my 8 year old would love."
R3210CGPQE4R0O,she loves this kind of thing and she was not disappointed.
R35NJ8XZD1983X,perfect
R2X94CNWS57GD1,"the design of the pouch is great, which is why i purchased it."
R2X94CNWS57GD1,but the dye used to color the pouch is terrible and stained my outfit black.
R2X94CNWS57GD1,it is also very shiny as opposed to the rest of my leather accessories which are flat black and do not stain.
R2X94CNWS57GD1,3 stars for the style and being slightly less expensive than some of the alternatives but i would not buy it again.
R38515WBG5TXEK,these worked as expected for decent price.
R38515WBG5TXEK,"i did notice the kit has only the bushings in the bearing carriers, instead of the rubber sealed bearings no blue bearings which come with the vxl."
R38515WBG5TXEK,the product title should not advertise vxl and should only state xl5 given this kit does not include bearings used by traxxas on the vxl models.
R38515WBG5TXEK,this was why 4star review.
R38515WBG5TXEK,"otherwise, a great product and works as intended."
R34G5SF902CPAG,bought thus for my grandsons birthday.
R34G5SF902CPAG,he liked it.
R3BKZISICVZHNF,great spacesaver!
R3BKZISICVZHNF,love the vibrant colors!
R3BKZISICVZHNF,ordered the matching table and chairs.
R38W378YXPFEZ7,i thought it would be made better and a little bigger than the box.
R27XWKPDQTJGX2,my niece loved this.
R27XWKPDQTJGX2,she plays with it all the time.
R27XWKPDQTJGX2,good for toddlers.
RAQ7BE5V8BYL5,"great booster box, it came in great condition and fully sealed."
RAQ7BE5V8BYL5,"as stated it is not weighed, and i managed to get 9ex cards!"
RAQ7BE5V8BYL5,i would recommend this product!
R18HRY483QN9FH,everything was as promised.
R18HRY483QN9FH,thanks!
R2EKEMEBC6X4QS,i bought two of these and my grandkids have been having a ball with them.
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,"oh my, we have a little girl in this house who is madly in love with this doll."
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,it is amazing.
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,"this is a girl who really wants to like dolls, but never finds one that she really wants to ""own."""
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,but not this doll.
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,"she carries this girl around all over the place, including in the car, to bed, on a hike, yep, pretty much everywhere."
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,she just loves the apron with the three little bears in it.
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,the doll itself is the perfect size for carrying around and is squeezable and soft.
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,"the little bear finger puppets are so cute, with simple details like a denim bottom half for the papa bear and a pink bow and pink patterned bottom for the momma bear that makes them interesting and fun to look at."
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,"the little puppets are simply sewn into her pockets, but it is just a few loops of thread, so they can be easily snipped if you want them out all the way."
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,"you can pop them out of the pocket and keep them sewn in, which is what i am planning on doing, since so much of the charm is in having those bears in her pockets."
R31BOTLQNNE9TI,and charming is overall the perfect word for this adorable doll!
R2C37YFT4RK7IV,my daughter was excited to get this.
R2C37YFT4RK7IV,this was her first time having any shrinky dinks and the whole experience was fun for her.
R2C37YFT4RK7IV,we kept the oven light on so she could watch them shrink.
R2C37YFT4RK7IV,"she loved mix and matching the outfits as if she were a designer and she made play that they were models in a fashion show, prepping in wardrobe before going on the catwalk."
R2C37YFT4RK7IV,"this box literally comes with everything you need minus the oven,even a pencil sharpener for the colored pencils that came with it."
R2C37YFT4RK7IV,"if your child loves fashion and creativity, i highly suggest these shrinky dinks.i received this at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review"
R253XHGXO79ST4,this item arrived in good condition and fits in with my other equine christmas ornaments.
R2YWM1UTFTC4KV,"lovegdnfhjnkml,"
REIK60Z6JMKMQ,great item thank you
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,this was somewhat of an accidental order.
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,i thought i was getting the size that actually holds both the pop!
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,"and its box, but this size only holds the pop!"
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,by itself.
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,"i did return the product, but i had opened the package first."
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,the plastic feels really sturdy and solid.
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,its not flimsy and weak.
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,i did email the seller to let them know that i didnt realize that this was the wrong size and i did not get offered to do a returnrefund.
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,"i was simply told ""im sorry for the confusion."
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,even though it wasnt the ones for the boxes you still got a great deal.
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,"i hope you can get some use of them."""
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,"im not angry at them, bc it was partly my fault for not paying close attention, but it didnt seem to be important to help me resolve my issue."
R2MORE1E4CB4UT,i would probably purchase from them again...paying close attention to the size being ordered.
R3SU2QQA24WJPG,beautiful wooden set.
R3SU2QQA24WJPG,the board has two sides on full size game one 9x9.

R2IMF66HBUT6H7,unique and creative like all the others!
R159E5099E8YZ5,i bought these for my grandchildren but tried on myself first.
R159E5099E8YZ5,it was easy to apply and is still on after 4 days and looks great.
R159E5099E8YZ5,much better quality than the ones ive bought for them at the store.
R159E5099E8YZ5,"they one that i applled on myself, some coworkers and my dad thought is gotten a real tattoo!"
R159E5099E8YZ5,disclosure i received this product for a discounted price for my honest opinion
RT9ODKKWXS8CE,my grandson loved it
R38YJV6ZKEFHLC,this is going to be a birthday present.
R38YJV6ZKEFHLC,i think it will be loved.
R38YJV6ZKEFHLC,it is not always easy to find unique harry potter things anymore.
R38YJV6ZKEFHLC,puzzles make great stress relief.
R1B5YX8K3XE1CK,this automobile engineer kit is perfect for the boy or girl who enjoys putting things together and finding out how things work.
R1B5YX8K3XE1CK,"the parts are like a cross between a plastic lego and tinker toy parts, and can be used to complete 10 different model vehicles found in the enclosed childrens story about two curious kids who journey to the supermarket with their father and the vehicles they encounter on their trip."
R1B5YX8K3XE1CK,"the large pieces make it easy for small children, ages 3 and up, to create."
R1B5YX8K3XE1CK,your child will learn some basics about how cars go together and work.
R1B5YX8K3XE1CK,this is perfect for the future budding engineer.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,"i wasnt expecting anything very durable, but this was even flimsier that i thought it would be."
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,i didnt want to actually play with it.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,i wanted to hang it from a keychain.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,i wanted to use a ball chain rather than the key chain that came with it.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,unfortunately the little screw eye was too tiny for the chain to fit through.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,i took it out and replaced it with a larger one and anchored it in place with epoxy.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,about that time the whole cube fell apart.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,"the pieces would not go back into place and stay, so i just super glued the whole thing together."
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,"it still looks like a rubiks cube, but now its a super solid single cube that is not going to fall apart again."
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,in the photo you can see where i tried to mount the screw eye in the middle.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,that did not work.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,that is what pushed the pieces apart.
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,"ok, that was my fault, not the manufacturers.bottom line if you just want something to hang from your keychain this will work."
R18D5QDDGKOJUM,dont plan on actually playing with it much.
R2JGV81OTRSKQY,"vibrant colors, and the pony was pretty."
R2JGV81OTRSKQY,lots of small pieces.
R15TOKFNUFA2YY,only thomas is a squirter.
R15TOKFNUFA2YY,diesel 10 is hard plastic.
R15TOKFNUFA2YY,the boat is a mix between.
R15TOKFNUFA2YY,my little guy loves the squirter...wish the other two could be used.
R3TS59DM1GTO1N,"oh, my ra!"
R3TS59DM1GTO1N,this doll is amazing!
R3SEN9T90GC0W3,"great value for the money, but remember you get what you pay for."
R3SEN9T90GC0W3,this is not hot wheels quality.
R3SEN9T90GC0W3,my grandson has autism and he commented that these are cheap and break easily.
R3SEN9T90GC0W3,"however, there are 50 cars included and he loves toy cars so he is happy"
RGPZL1WQR3AZM,great product and great seller these are real original syma spare parts and it came really quick from china about 5 days.
R1TW1JJ8DF3LBY,as compact and travellike as advertised.major shortfall is the rack.
R1TW1JJ8DF3LBY,"the racks are so small and not long enough that the tiles cannot be properly positioned on them without falling off occasionally.they could have cut down on the fancy part of the rack covering and simply made it the usual rack we all know, but wider and more accommodating of the tiles.other than that, i cant fault the board at all."
R1TW1JJ8DF3LBY,nice touch on the folding feature.
R1TW1JJ8DF3LBY,"tiles fit perfectly in the board squares, and wont move if shaken."
R1TW1JJ8DF3LBY,the board can also be covered with the tiles remaining exactly where they are.
R1TW1JJ8DF3LBY,"this is nice.theres a small compartment within as well, i guess to store stuff."
R1TW1JJ8DF3LBY,"dont see much going in there for me though except for a pen and paper.so yeah, its a miniature travel board as advertised."
R1TW1JJ8DF3LBY,the main demerit is the inconvenience in using the racks.
R1TW1JJ8DF3LBY,an alternative though might be to use bigger racks instead of the one included.cheers!
R2XOZL9BIOTVAY,update the seller did a great job replacing the bank.
R2XOZL9BIOTVAY,the next one i received works perfectly.
R2XOZL9BIOTVAY,my little one year old granddaughter is fascinated by the pandas arm taking her coin.
R2XOZL9BIOTVAY,"whenever she comes to visit, she walks over to me and wants to put the coins in the bank."
R2XOZL9BIOTVAY,a very cute item!
R2XOZL9BIOTVAY,the panda did not work.
R2XOZL9BIOTVAY,"all i get is the cute voices, nothing else."
R2XOZL9BIOTVAY,working with seller for a solution.

R1U18SS0YYJJC0,great family game!!!
R1U18SS0YYJJC0,!
R2301MUXA534NO,"this comes in the mail in a small box with the fabric canvas folded, paints, brushes, number guide, and a tiny 3 14"" x 4 14"" picure of completed product."
R2301MUXA534NO,the canvas appears to be possibly a type of vinyl laminated to an even weave fabric.
R2301MUXA534NO,it comes folded up & the folds are creased into the fabric.
R2301MUXA534NO,"it has to be stretched to eliminate the folds, which involves purchasing something to stretch it with."
R2301MUXA534NO,"i used a frame meant for working cross stitch or needlepoint, which meant rolling it onto the bars & having to roll it several times to put the creases in the center & roll & lock tight, then turn it sideways & repeat process."
R2301MUXA534NO,all but the center crease came out this way & that is more of a roll in the fabric now than a crease.
R2301MUXA534NO,so i am going to try putting it back on the frame again for a longer period of time.
R2301MUXA534NO,i left it on for each crease for 1 day.
R2301MUXA534NO,this is timely & im sure there is something out there that is meant for stretching fabric.
R2301MUXA534NO,possibly a quilting product?
R2301MUXA534NO,"i did paint a small area to see how the paint went onto this type of canvas, and it goes on smooth & looks fine."
RWTVKP91L9OEH,my almost 3 year old loves this.

R9HHV2ZNSGJNB,they play it often.
R1KJB55DEXLDQY,neat toy
R7HBG253SAOVD,just like many other users...my complaint was the charger was of bad quality.
R7HBG253SAOVD,"however, when i read that you have to push the battery connection in until it clicks...i saw that the fault was mine."
R7HBG253SAOVD,"of course it is more difficult to remove the battery once it is connected properly, but that will improve after a few usages."
R1ZWWL04X5CA6H,the gloves are way too big and they look like i could have sewn them together.
R1ZWWL04X5CA6H,the leather is already coming apart.
R1ZWWL04X5CA6H,"i use them while roller skating because they are leather until they fall apart, but i wouldnt recommend you buy them."
R1GLAU0IFXNOYH,good item
R2BMCEU24LCXTK,my grandson carson loves this car.
R1485FK37N9G79,just what i wanted
R26J1DI539H3EN,"the dice and strategy are very easy to understand, but the cards may seem a bit daunting."
R26J1DI539H3EN,"if you are hosting the game i would strongly recommend knowing the cards and how to interpret them quickly.this is easily a family favorite, hours if fun, great art and concept"
R220PLBSDVAKTE,one of the pieces goofy came apart after my son played with it only once.
R220PLBSDVAKTE,the picture piece came off the magnet.

R1CWUMUWL5XE1D,my wife cried when i gave her this item and remarked how well made it looked.
REZXWI9K7Z1YG,"i got these at a discounted price, they are a christmas gift for my 6yr old grandson."
REZXWI9K7Z1YG,i put 3 of them together the other day .they are very cute and easy to put pieces together .they make for a nice gift at a good price.
R1FDJYP2FBP52V,"love this game, shipped and got here right on time, very pleased customer"
R2DMRYTY3KSIHI,"very nice toy, the quality is higher than i expected for this price range."
R2DMRYTY3KSIHI,"its also nice because it isnt just a straight forward xylophone, there are several different ways to play with it."
R2DMRYTY3KSIHI,highly recommended.
R2GWVET5EIDV89,great.
R1MBEYD0Y1XSIN,"all was correct, but wish it went through 12s."
R1MBEYD0Y1XSIN,only goes through 9s.
R23ZPP3Z2OFGL0,kids love it.
R23ZPP3Z2OFGL0,but we have other mil houses that are made much better.
R3FB46DXHHVBLG,our family loves what we call double solitaire seems to be another name for nerts and we purchased these to send to college with our daughter so that dormmates could play as well.
R3FB46DXHHVBLG,cards are good quality and we liked the fact that you got a lot for your money.
R3FB46DXHHVBLG,made us feel less bad about sending them to college.
R3FB46DXHHVBLG,will probably pick up a set for our mountain house.
R179KQVQ4002AX,good
R1OD9DYV7HID6W,"if you know what cah is and like it, this is a great way to keep the game interesting lots of expansions and get a case for your collection at a good price  a fair bit cheaper 3050 less than buying the same sets and a case separately."
R1OD9DYV7HID6W,"still some room but not much for additional expansions like the unofficial ""crabs against humanity"" as well."
R1OD9DYV7HID6W,"the case i got also says ""im a horrible case"" which i liked and found amusing."
R1OD9DYV7HID6W,"it certainly made the box a conversation starter and while most of the times i played it was planned, i can imagine that would make it easier to get a game going at a party ad hoc."
R3LL5H0WFQVPNF,fine crayons for the kids!
RC0IVEUTKAYY,sturdy.
RC0IVEUTKAYY,easy to assemble.
RC0IVEUTKAYY,we bought this for our grandsons first birthday.
RC0IVEUTKAYY,we still have little tikes ride ons from when his mother was young.
R2FCC4AHBBFJ3S,got this for my sons 2nd birthday and he loves it!
R2FCC4AHBBFJ3S,the only change i would make is putting a volume control on it as it us kind of loud.
R2FCC4AHBBFJ3S,it works great!
R1JQPBP7ZPP8OI,we kept it on the side table cause we liked it so much.
R11FCAQ7P0SMA2,this game is just like the double solitaire that we used to play a long time ago!
R11FCAQ7P0SMA2,we played with 4 people and called it fourple solitaire.
R11FCAQ7P0SMA2,its fun to be playing this again.
R3VA0ONYYLQXD7,good
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,this is a well put together toy.
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,i love the layout and things you can do with it!
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,adults will love playing with it too and it inspires some really mechanically inclined type of play.
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,"a bit of assembly is required, and because of the mechanized parts, i think an adult should always be present in my opinion."
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,"its not that it is a dangerous toy, it is just common sense and also you dont want the child doing things that will damage this great toy."
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,it has a fun design and a fairly durable track and parts.
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,"i really love the crane, but keep in mind there are a few choking hazards."
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,keep away from small children and dogs.
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,"i suppose there are a few areas where fingers could get pinched a some of the track would hurt like crazy to step on with bare feet probably not as bad as stepping on a leggo, so again, use common sense."
R12KF5CLIC6ZCG,"other than that, it is a very imaginative and colorful toy that i dont mind playing with for hours with the grandchildren."
R2ZQZAC7AO4HJA,great
R89O98MQ1RZNK,these are well worth the money spent.
R89O98MQ1RZNK,"of all the gifts our daughter received for her 3rd birthday, this set has been played with the most."
R89O98MQ1RZNK,every child who visits the house is instantly drawn to these colourful tiles.
R89O98MQ1RZNK,"they are also appealing to adults, and i often find myself on the floor joining in the fun."
R89O98MQ1RZNK,"they are stacked into towers, flown as airplanes, and crafted into homes for littlest pet shops the pets with magnets on their feet can stick to the tiles!"
R89O98MQ1RZNK,"interestingly, the box they came in had the wrong quantities listed on it."
R89O98MQ1RZNK,"we actually got 32 not 26 small squares, 2 large squares, 4 windows, 10 not 12 small triangles, 8 not 10 long triangles, and 4 not 6 wide triangles."
R89O98MQ1RZNK,"this, to me, is a bonus, as the small squares are the most popular pieces for building up."
R89O98MQ1RZNK,"though they are not too easy on the wallet, considering the hours of play value they provide, they are absolutely worth the cost."
R89O98MQ1RZNK,we have ordered more for our children to expand the range of creations they can make.
R89O98MQ1RZNK,highly recommended!
RV6ZJF5J7CWXD,has become a favorite
R2IT9B3BJLLZ08,the item broke in a matter of 5 minutes.
R2IT9B3BJLLZ08,it is not a fun log.
R2IT9B3BJLLZ08,kids cant have any fun on it as it will break.
R2IT9B3BJLLZ08,we were offered a second one and that one broke just as quickly.
R2IT9B3BJLLZ08,it has an inner plastic tubing that holds all the foam pieces on but cant withstand any amount of flexing.
RUZD0HIW6EHL4,"it may need alittle more weight added to it, other than that i loved it"
R2NPCGM72OUAKS,bought this for my 2 year old nephew for when he visits.
R2NPCGM72OUAKS,he loves them.
R2NPCGM72OUAKS,they are easy for him to put together and take apart and i like that they come in a zippered bag.
R2NPCGM72OUAKS,we play with these for hours.
R1J5828R0VIBRY,great little toy.
R1J5828R0VIBRY,the two year old i bought it for loves following his daddy around with it to help with yard work.
R1J5828R0VIBRY,not too loud either.
R22I91CURXOOFU,worked great for a week at the cabin with 7 teens... had to add air each day to keep it firm but it wasnt due to a leak.
R37ZR5AV3H2928,not good.
R37ZR5AV3H2928,about 10 of the balloons actually worked and those that did were pretty small.
R37ZR5AV3H2928,"see the attached pictures, the bag is full of balloons that either didnt blow up or deflated within a minute."
R37ZR5AV3H2928,very disappointed
R7T1S3GJIGPQ7,a great game for adults to play with children.
R7T1S3GJIGPQ7,"simple enough for the kiddies, yet still entertaining for older children and adults."
R37EO8MTV7M6NT,"if i saw this in person, unfortunately i wouldnt have purchased it."
R37EO8MTV7M6NT,"the picture its beautiful, but the coloring isnt great in real life."
R37EO8MTV7M6NT,"the turtle is just green, not that pretty sea colored greenteal in photo and the part where the splash of water is lopsided."
R37EO8MTV7M6NT,looks rather stupid!
R37EO8MTV7M6NT,"but i am happy to say, i just bent it to where it looks better...not great but better."
RX6ISNXMAM7OE,awesome!

R3F1MTX2IIEEUG,"they are working and charging, glad i bought some extra batteries."
R1OQ5Y51OLK9SO,one of the back wheels will not stay on but it is very cute for the price.
R1OQ5Y51OLK9SO,i use it for photographs and it works well for that.
R1OQ5Y51OLK9SO,it might not be sturdy enough for small children though.
R3LCU3U8WWX71Z,this wood burning tool is used by some of the greatest burners !!
R3LCU3U8WWX71Z,reasonable price to buy several to switch using tips !

R3VCLRGI2R0U4O,"they are small, as expected"
R1RWI2MWZDWD4M,my daughter loves this!
R1RWI2MWZDWD4M,she uses it as her night light.
R1RWI2MWZDWD4M,i love that it has a timer so it automatically shuts off after 10 min.
R1RWI2MWZDWD4M,the only negative is that i wish it came with a wall charger.
R1RWI2MWZDWD4M,i hate going through batteries.
R3E58CFEAER43F,my kids play with these all th time!
R3E58CFEAER43F,my three year old nephew sits for hours with these!
R3N8TPS8C1JSUC,if you really need them to actually keep to the listed times then these are not for you.
R3N8TPS8C1JSUC,"but, they are great as long as your tolerance is fine within 10  or so."
R3N8TPS8C1JSUC,we use them to help our twin three year olds figure out when it is time to trade toys.
R3N8TPS8C1JSUC,its been fun to get them to pick one to see how long they have to wait  the amount of sand doesnt necessarily correlate to the amount of time!
R134P12RZ5T00U,i couldnt be happier with this!
R134P12RZ5T00U,"my daughter wanted a stuffed baymax and after looking around and reading reviews, got this one."
R134P12RZ5T00U,"i ordered this and 2 weeks later it arrived china to va...i opened it up and it was a very well made, soft, and a firm but fluffy baymax firmer stuffing."
R134P12RZ5T00U,ill be ordering 2 more so all the kids have their own and there wont be any fighting over it.
R134P12RZ5T00U,"it is suitable for infants as the eyes are embroidered and its all fluff, it does says ""ages 0"" on tag."
R134P12RZ5T00U,"it is 100 genuine authentic disney, has it on tag and foot."
R134P12RZ5T00U,i love this and you and your kids will too!
R134P12RZ5T00U,it doesnt pose or stand up on its own  its a simple stuffed animal type toy  absolutely nothing hard on or in it.
R134P12RZ5T00U,extremely huggable!
R3QGXDOYYGJK6W,i an throwing this one away.
R3QGXDOYYGJK6W,"the fact that it is a ""painting"" makes it hard to see clear matches of the pieces."
R3QGXDOYYGJK6W,"do not buy this puzzle, im not even donating it like i do most puzzles."
R3QGXDOYYGJK6W,it would not help anyone.
R3QGXDOYYGJK6W,the pieces are also not completely interlocking so you are sometimes not sure if the piece it correct or not.

R1Q14IFZXUI336,not suitable for age it targets.....easily rips
R2Y182GY0QH3A8,terrible!!!!
R2Y182GY0QH3A8,so deceiving.
R2Y182GY0QH3A8,what you picture is not what you get.
R2Y182GY0QH3A8,you get a tiny box of 500 ammo refills even though it pictures other items.
R2Y182GY0QH3A8,shipping is more than the cost of the item.
R2Y182GY0QH3A8,shame on us for not reading the review...but maybe by adding another review it will help someone else avoid the same stupid mistake  but shame on you maya group for being so deceptive in the first place.
R2Y182GY0QH3A8,clear advertising will help cultivate satisfied customers.

R1T9HVRLBYQEXY,"instead of pitching forward into the wind it will just level out and hover and then drift away, and if it is downwind of you good luck getting it back to you, even with the headless mode."

R11YJ9TWROQB7W,weve been using these for a couple of years now.
R11YJ9TWROQB7W,"they never fail to entertain all the kids at the partypicnic, no matter the age."
R11YJ9TWROQB7W,"simply pump up the balloon, have the kid hold it so its straight up in the air and then let it go."
R11YJ9TWROQB7W,"it flies around, making an amusing noise and all the kids try to follow its zig zagging pattern while it deflates."
R11YJ9TWROQB7W,"just the other day, we manned a station at a preschool school picnic and all the kids were so excited about the balloons that they other stations were nearly empty."

R2HXJ1AWSWIIJ0,possibly the greatest item i have ever purchased so far.
R2HXJ1AWSWIIJ0,hours of fun can be had with this toy.
R2HXJ1AWSWIIJ0,i got it for my daughter for her first birthday to encourage crawling since she was born prematurely.
R2HXJ1AWSWIIJ0,"it worked wonders, giving her the motivation to try and crawl."
R2HXJ1AWSWIIJ0,"she is now walkingrunning, and she still loves this piano toy that she has had for almost a year."
R1CLN112T0Z3DA,falls somewhere between a micro and a mini copter.
R1CLN112T0Z3DA,goes through the battery crazy fast.
R1CLN112T0Z3DA,doesnt take much to knock it out of alignment.
R1CLN112T0Z3DA,once that happens its pretty much over.
R1CLN112T0Z3DA,adjustment levels on controller suck.

R2191NJTE0FCIG,the post is labeled cheerson cx10.
R2191NJTE0FCIG,"if you click on ""color options"", youll notice that instead of seeing cheerson youll see pheonixtec for all other options except the first."
R2191NJTE0FCIG,these are not the same product!
R2191NJTE0FCIG,"they are extremely similar, but there are minor differences."
R2191NJTE0FCIG,i mistakenly purchased a pheonixtec quad by accident.
R2191NJTE0FCIG,"after flying it for a total of approximately ten flights i already began experiencing problems they stabilization easily became off, causing it to suddenly pitch to one side or another, as well as drop and ascend without being commanded."
R2191NJTE0FCIG,"not a lot, around six inches."
R2191NJTE0FCIG,after medium impact crashes one blade of the quad would spin at full speed without being commanded.
R2191NJTE0FCIG,i would turn off the transmitter and it would not stop.
R2191NJTE0FCIG,the only way to stop it was too turn off the quad and then back on again.
R2191NJTE0FCIG,this happened multiple times.
R2191NJTE0FCIG,avoid purchasing knock off versions of the original cheerson.
R2191NJTE0FCIG,"aside from these problems caused by pheonixtec, the product is excellent."
R2191NJTE0FCIG,"i strongly recommend purchasing one, theyre less than $20!"
R2191NJTE0FCIG,why not!?
R2191NJTE0FCIG,just be sure to purchase a genuine cheerson!

R2KTUEO3DJP67O,"when i took them to the local grocery store to have them inflated, the people at the store thought that the big trex was the most awesome balloon ever."
R2KTUEO3DJP67O,"however, the trex and one of the star balloons would not hold air for very long."
R2KTUEO3DJP67O,we filled them up the day before the party and those 2 balloons were seriously deflated by the day of the party.
R2KTUEO3DJP67O,"we even took the trex back to the store to reinflate it, but that didnt really do much good."
R2KTUEO3DJP67O,boo.
R2KTUEO3DJP67O,the other 3 that did work were really cute and stayed inflated for a long time weeks.
R2KTUEO3DJP67O,"but its really the biggest balloon that made me buy this set, and thats one of the ones that didnt work."
R2KTUEO3DJP67O,"i made no attempt to return the item or contact the seller about this issue, by the way."

R19LQNB4VW7QSE,"i usually dont mind bootlegs, but the bootleg version of the pokemon center espeon poke plush has a lopsided head unlike the one that i have."
R19LQNB4VW7QSE,"espeon is my favorite eeveeloution alongside sylveon, leafeon and umbreon, and i thought that having a average size espeon plush thats larger than the unofficial espeon poke doll would be a wonderful gift for me, she looks just like a nekotama cat from japanese mythology and folklore, and even more cute!this espeon plush is adorable and beautiful simultaneously."
R19LQNB4VW7QSE,the wonderful purplelilac minky fabric used to make her is luxuriously soft like every pokemon center licensed pokemon plush!
R19LQNB4VW7QSE,"shes structured very well, even better than every other espeon plush ever made.the kuttari cuties espeon plush, both awake and asleep forms, are ridiculously adorable too!"
R19LQNB4VW7QSE,"the stitching and shaping is satisfactory, and deserves an a!also, if you want an authentic version of this plush instead of a bootleg one, you could possibly be out of luck."
R19LQNB4VW7QSE,"they are very rare to find and if you are lucky enough to find one, they are ridiculously expensive."
R19LQNB4VW7QSE,"sadly, bootleg pokemon plushies are a lot cheaper than the authentic ones.if you ever get this plush, you should get her lunar counterpart, umbreon, to go along with her."
R19LQNB4VW7QSE,even a sylveon would go good with this plush too.
R19LQNB4VW7QSE,this is definitely my no.1 favorite eeveeloution in sweet and huggable plush form!

R1H2EYPMGLMPSE,they are pose able but stiff when new.

R2DARFRED3XK6R,the add a wonderful element to the game.
R2DARFRED3XK6R,"microcosm is great as well, though the rules are a touch inscrutable."
R2DARFRED3XK6R,i had to ask a friend how interacting with the planets works.
R2DARFRED3XK6R,"once, i got that down, ive found that i quite like this game."
RN40PGAMMWU6W,gdtr 3 loves it
R40XUXAIWVKVS,love it and my daughter loves it as well.
R40XUXAIWVKVS,it looks so cute too
RNLW2PKI25WFV,"this kit not only taught me how to juggle balls, but also to juggle life."
RNLW2PKI25WFV,they taught me to love again and showed me that the world is a wonderful place.
RNLW2PKI25WFV,the joy brought to me by this kit rivals the joy felt by the ewoks and the rest of the rebels when the death star was destroyed.
RNLW2PKI25WFV,"truly, this kit gave me a new skill and the confidence to go out and pursue any goal that might present itself to me."
RNLW2PKI25WFV,"after i watched the great video and began to juggle, i felt more powerful than hercules had he lived in a time of proper nutrition and the legendary shake weight."
RNLW2PKI25WFV,the life lessons taught by mr. m beat any university that i have so far attended.
RNLW2PKI25WFV,"when life hands you lemons, juggle them for the amusement of others.also the little sack they come with is nice."
R331LYWFYSER4L,so much fun to have at our kids party
R32NN7179CS46B,great quality toy to bring back the nostalagic memories
R1FKD11XJ2TISX,there were parts missing once it arrived new in package.
R31BXY45M368ZF,we searched all over the interest just for this vintage baby miss piggy doll.
R31BXY45M368ZF,i had one when i was a little girl and my daughter really wanted one to match mommy.
R31BXY45M368ZF,after looking for months we finally found here here.
R31BXY45M368ZF,she arrived to use in much better condition than described and my little one is extremely happy with her.
R31BXY45M368ZF,she will be very well loved.
R1PR674E2G7129,great looking balloons.
R1PR674E2G7129,very hard to find birthday supplies for these cartoons but these balloons are exceptional.
RC7HMI1XRJDGB,i am just in love with it.
R3D9GN5PSIGC06,"the quality is not really what i was expecting this item is more of a ""toy"" not really to protect from the cold."
R2J2UXHLUJQ8KV,very hard to get my big chubby fingers to only bend the tabs and not the whole plane... no real redoes either...
R2GE25F7OHL71N,"they almost all worked, but the balloons tended to bounce off their target rather than break."
R2GE25F7OHL71N,the kids still had fun and they were easy to do.
R2GE25F7OHL71N,the trick is filling them as much as they possibly can and let them fall off when theyre ready.
R2GE25F7OHL71N,slow and steady water flow works best.
R2JM5JBF8CG8CU,these are truly remarkable.
R2JM5JBF8CG8CU,the colors are bright and blend beautifully and the convenience is terrific.
R2JM5JBF8CG8CU,"these real brush pens make me feel like an artist, and i can honestly say that my watercoloring prowess has improved since i started using them!"
R331KBH2H6EIR8,"oh my god, well maybe i started off a little dramatic."
R331KBH2H6EIR8,"fact is though, this pretty little kitchen started falling apart within a week, after a month or so, every door had broken off, after 2 moths the whole thing was leaning."
R331KBH2H6EIR8,"this product is bad, purchased a different one from ikia, i usually do not like ikia products, but it turned out to be 10 times better than this one."
R331KBH2H6EIR8,"sorry to give a bad review, but this product was a 100 waste of my money."
R6ZGGN4MB4UD,i bought this piano and spray painted it black.
R6ZGGN4MB4UD,since it comes disassembled it is very easy to spray paint the instructions are not that great but it is still really easy to assemble.
R6ZGGN4MB4UD,i bought this for a pullip doll and the size is perfect.it is not the sturdiest but for adults and older children it should hold up just fine..you will not find a better 16 scale piano for this price.
RYN77IGVGF37B,it is a great set.
RYN77IGVGF37B,i wish there are more variety to the pictures.
RYN77IGVGF37B,"there are basically about 13 different photos, they basically repeat them by zoom in and out on different cards."
R1C7T5FQWEC6U,i didnt like it if you poped it it exploded it was hard to put together if you corner cut 5 degrees it exploded
R2WR8J6QBEXSXS,what piece of junk.
R2WR8J6QBEXSXS,broke immediately.
R2WR8J6QBEXSXS,"disappointed my child.was going to return it, but so annoyed and frustrated i packaged it up and forgot to drop it off."
R2WR8J6QBEXSXS,ugh!
R2WR8J6QBEXSXS,!
R16DNBAJIOQQLH,adults agree therere so much fun with zombie dice!
R16DNBAJIOQQLH,get em.
R16DNBAJIOQQLH,"note, the do stick to the wall when you throw em there!"
R2K01UMASWLF5P,my almost 3 year old absolutely loves this.
R2K01UMASWLF5P,"we made an error buying the little tikes hop ball, thinking he could burn energy that way."
R2K01UMASWLF5P,well he just kept falling off.
R2K01UMASWLF5P,this is big but way safer and he will play several times a day on it.
R2K01UMASWLF5P,he gets good bounce and we are having more restful nights as it is too hot to go out where we live.
R2K01UMASWLF5P,very happy purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for a good toddler trampoline.
R1NCROUEP3WSCO,perfect gift for my twins!
R1NCROUEP3WSCO,good transaction.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,the daniel tiger was exactly as it looks in the picture.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,"it is not big, about the size of my hand."
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,which is the perfect size for my 2 year old.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,i did not think he felt or looked cheap.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,he seems like he will handle some play for a long time.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,his sweater is sewn to his body.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,as are his shoes.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,the ties on his neck and shoes are sewn in very securely.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,they are short strings so i do not think it would pose any hazards if they were torn off by a little one.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,everything is embroidered so there are no parts that can come off during alone play.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,"as soon as my son took him out of the package he had a huge smile and said ""my daniel tiger"" he has loved on him since."
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,our daniel did come wearing a little fabric watch that was held on by a stitch but it keep sliding off daniels wrist.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,i cut the stitch so he isnt wearing his watch anymore but it really doesnt matter to myself or my son.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,i know he will get lots of lovin so i will post a rereview in a couple weeks to say how he has held up to being a loved friend.
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,so far i am extremely pleased and so is my son!
R3SHB8XU3P32IN,!
R16CLIBL6Y2PTM,great battery.

R2WYMWXZJNDE66,this is a great sturdy set that goes well with a play kitchen set.
R2WYMWXZJNDE66,love it!
R1S4W8FJIBBVY,i was expecting slightly less power but its quite strong not super fast but its very accurate and very very easy to learnits a lot of fun to fly around fans ceiling fans box fans and the oscillating fans made my own trials course with lots of controlled windthe range seems great and unlike most of the infrared rc helicopers ive had this tiny one seems to keep its signal the bestcharges quickthe light it has is very dim i dont know if that just mine or the fact that the led is just so smallyou cant use it to navigate unless its totally pitch black it does help to locate it when its fallen into a dark areathe rotors seem durable its fallen from quite a distance and has had no signs of damagei love this controller out of all the cheaper helicopers ive had and used this simple one takes the cake well donethe charging plug flops there is no notch to hold it in place when in the fully upright positionthe battery last a good while i start out hovering at maybe 30 throttle tops and by 57 minutes im pushing it at 7080 throttle just to keep it in the air they did a good job syncing battery level and throttle powerthe metal charging plug it self is very small and seems like it can break very easily and be a good reason to have a second charger aroundthis is the only thing i can see breaking easily with little kidsthe tail is solid but the motor is not super strong but seems to do the jobage rating 10fun rating for all ages 910could be faster may need to upgrade motors
R1WBDHRRFR7FIY,"i thought i may have lost my family to electronics, but thanks to this game, i see there is hope!"
R1WBDHRRFR7FIY,we have spent hours playing it and its as much fun as i remember!
RABNDDWHSGQWF,super awesome addition to my lego minifig space guy collection!
RABNDDWHSGQWF,excellent condition!
RABNDDWHSGQWF,thanks!
R1V4ILH30CI2ZD,just another great armor kit from dragon.
R1V4ILH30CI2ZD,the only reason its 4 stars is because the tracks are individual and need to be glued together 1 by 1. i like that the barrel is 1 piece so there is no need to glue or sand it.
R1V4ILH30CI2ZD,"this is a great kit with great detail, excellent fit, and looks awesome when complete."
R2BABMEW0NKM7G,"another weird and very wonky thomas the train percy covered in jelly beans arrived safely, securely and right on time at my daughters home much to the delighted squeals of laughter from my thomas the trainomaniac grandson."
R36ZY4Z2JDAGRD,my 4 year old niece loves her new my little pony family
R1SE1OGLMDPH4S,this beautiful baby doll is about the size of a premie.
R1SE1OGLMDPH4S,it looks so much like a real newborn that i want to cuddle it myself.
R1SE1OGLMDPH4S,it comes with a nice little layette set so the child can dress the baby.
R1SE1OGLMDPH4S,the clothes are well made and of a similar quality to actual newborn clothes.
R1SE1OGLMDPH4S,very pleased.
R3TC9ZYAZ0K0I2,like cut a bit smaller than i was expecting.
R1UBJAIQHVDTWH,excellent!
R1UBJAIQHVDTWH,worked very well!

R4B3MP2GWPMY8,lotta great pieces.
R4B3MP2GWPMY8,good set.
RWZREC4R5RCF2,"fit very well, i am completely satisfied."
R20GVUTDQRW658,"decent quality, fun toy."
R20GVUTDQRW658,my octonauts fan instantly recognized it from the episode and began making up new stories to act out with it.
R3GVC8IG5U9271,great product!
R3GVC8IG5U9271,arrived quickly also.
RQEC5Z4IVUK0U,fun and simple game with several varieties of play.
RQEC5Z4IVUK0U,"compactly packaged, perfectly for family trips."
RQEC5Z4IVUK0U,appropriate for all ages.
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,i bought this thing just thinking it was a joke.
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,i put paper in and out came a $100 bill.
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,haha good one!
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,"i kept doing this to make a bunch of these 100s to mess with my friends, as this thing made pretty ledgable 100s."
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,"anyway, i took to my friend who is a cop."
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,i pull out these $100 dollar stacks and he freaks out!
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,"so i try to keep the joke going by taking him out to eat at olive garden and paying for himwhen they wont accept the hundred, ill simply just hand over my card, jokes over."
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,"hiwever, when it came down to paying, the joke was on me!"
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,they accepted these fake 100s!!
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,i couldnt beleive it!
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,the waiter came back with change and everything!
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,"so i went back home, i took out one of the hundreds and studied it carefully, long story short, this childs toy makes real 100 dollar bills!"
R2DUL6EEFIDQ04,it has the safty strip and all!
R3ULNY1KK1Q8N9,"great product, i strongly recommend it."
R10VTIAH86QHYK,this helicopter is truly wonderful for its price point.
R10VTIAH86QHYK,"flying it is easy, if not particularly helicopter like, you only have throttle left hand , forwardreverse and rudder right hand."
R10VTIAH86QHYK,theres no sideways flight as in a real helicopter or quadcopter.
R10VTIAH86QHYK,"the downside, if there is one, is it isnt much of an outdoor flier  it is strongly affected by wind and sunlight will disrupt the infrared control signal, you if you want to go outside, you will want calm overcast or evening hours days.it seems to hold up ok in crashes, but i always kill the throttle when i think a crash is about to happen."
R10VTIAH86QHYK,"it does come with extra blades, i havent had to use them yet."
R5UE5Y9BZG1BE,"i begged my parents to buy me a go board, and since they didnt know anything they told me to find one and tell them which one i wanted."
R5UE5Y9BZG1BE,though i was given a price range so it was really difficult to find a good on.
R5UE5Y9BZG1BE,"fortunately i stumbled onto this board, and it was perfect."
R5UE5Y9BZG1BE,"so i told them ""this is the go set i would like."""
R5UE5Y9BZG1BE,i received it for christmas so ive owned it for almost 9 months.
R5UE5Y9BZG1BE,"i absolutely love this set, i think the product differs slightly occasionally as ive seen people commenting on how the lines werent in alignment, or the board didnt lie flat."
R5UE5Y9BZG1BE,"however mine lies perfectly flat, the clasp aligns perfectly and the lines are exactly how they should be."
R5UE5Y9BZG1BE,i dont really have any comments on the stones since ive never owned a go set before and dont know the difference between stone types.
R5UE5Y9BZG1BE,"the only thing i can say is i dont have any complaints about them, and they are smooth to the touch."
R1J3T9NI25QBTI,my granddaughter loved this little puppet when she saw her at the library with a princess book.
R1J3T9NI25QBTI,"i purchased her one, too since she was sad that the princess would be lonely when we took her back."
R20DZUXYGC1WKY,great
R1B87F3I9H0BIH,great indoor slide .
R23OV73ILT2D9I,my son loved it!
R3NRIO6FLD7R0P,the sticky backing on the die cuts had arrived dried up and looked old.
R3NRIO6FLD7R0P,"because it wasnt sticky, it was useless and a waste of money!"
R1093IN7LD2X1,very happy with the size & quality.
RSXYSTLTPZ3I5,i got this for my son in college.
RSXYSTLTPZ3I5,he loves it and is constantly challenging himself and me.
RSXYSTLTPZ3I5,"once he said ""if you can get the spike in less than 10 tries ill go to the store for you"" i got it in 8 and enjoyed the look on his face!"
R1E38ENAFXENHD,small and powerful!
R1E38ENAFXENHD,really shoots!
R240XOT4AX8XT6,my 18 month old granddaughter wont go to bed without it.
RHITWPZC3NLLG,my son loved it
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,this item was purchased for my sons 7th birthday.
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,it is easy to control.
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,it runs over our stone driveway with no problem.
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,it goes great down the dirt road behind our barn.
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,it does tend to get stuck in the grass when it goes over a thick patch.
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,"all in all, im pleased with its performance."
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,my son really likes it.
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,"it did not come with any instructions, however, its pretty selfexplanatory."
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,my only hang up was with connecting the battery pack to the truck.
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,my husband had some trouble working with it because the wires are short and the connector is small for his big hands.
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,"also, when charging the battery pack the red indicator light turns on, but i have no idea when the battery is fully charged because nothing ever happens."
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,is it supposed to turn green?
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,is it supposed to go out?
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,there is no paperwork explaining anything.
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,"other than that, we like it."
R16N7FX83EA6DJ,i think its a good choice for a first timer.
RKQMFCDWE4L47,"i needed one, but the package was reasonably priced and the sand dollars are beautiful."
RD5GBDGGBVPLK,would have been 5 stars except that 2 pieces were missing.
RD5GBDGGBVPLK,they were on the edges so they did not impact the overall puzzle.
RD5GBDGGBVPLK,still....i think its unacceptable for that to happen.
RD5GBDGGBVPLK,i enjoyed the puzzle itself however.
RD5GBDGGBVPLK,just enough sky to be challenging without driving me crazy.
R2YNS39OAOSMMO,"i like it, great deal!"
R2YNS39OAOSMMO,my kid plays in it almost every day since its been hot.
R2PIU7T73JXK5X,thanks
R2UXGSCYYTO9V0,perfect for the dr who fan in your life!
R2UXGSCYYTO9V0,"total novelty item but thats the fun, u suppose."

R38AJ2Q2W72GJC,children enjoyed the table
RK2GF5ZOHEDW9,awesome...worked great
R2QDCURXPGHLY4,this game is very fun similar to the newer models.
R2QDCURXPGHLY4,the old models had the specialist card plus money.
R2QDCURXPGHLY4,this one just tells you what to grab.
R2QDCURXPGHLY4,but come on its minions and more monions.
R2QDCURXPGHLY4,i paid 25 at walmart.
R2QDCURXPGHLY4,seeing it for 15 might as well but one for my niece
R2CDD2T15MTH1X,"did not like these  there were way to small for my event to be use at my wedding candy buffet and they werent that sturdy,"
R6SBT7ETVTHH2,ubongo is a fun addition to our familys game cabinet.
R6SBT7ETVTHH2,its a quick about 20 minutes and competitive game that my husband and i enjoy.
R6SBT7ETVTHH2,"the puzzles themselves are fun and generally take well under a minute, at least at the easier level."
R6SBT7ETVTHH2,the timer and gems add complexity  but i think whether thats a good thing depends on your taste.
R6SBT7ETVTHH2,we opted to play without the timer whoever solved first won that round.
R6SBT7ETVTHH2,"drawing gems added an element of chance, which could easily mean the difference in the outcome for evenly matched competitors."
R6SBT7ETVTHH2,"two levels puzzles with 3 or 4 pieces mean you can adjust difficulty  and provide a way for my son to play against me more evenly.i hold back from five stars because it isnt our favorite, but ubongo is a game well play again and enjoy."
RIDW4NJT4JUJD,the hat was too big but it was a great accessory to my costume!
R36E048VPUOU3B,cute but noisy!
R1MG1XYGQZ1G2N,cube sucksafter about 3 weeks of usethe inner pieces break!

R15J74CEBR2M97,and no duplicates
R1FYU39B1ZX9SL,"my almostthree year old has had ""bockbock"" for about a year."
R1FYU39B1ZX9SL,he loves this chicken.
R1FYU39B1ZX9SL,"its quite durable, washable, and huggable."
R1FYU39B1ZX9SL,a great toddler gift!
R2W3X4XZ6L5O4S,"not even close to correct size, slip seemed to be different size then dress."
R2W3X4XZ6L5O4S,"ordered size bigger thinking it would for sure fit in two months, fit about 2 sizes to small"
R1P2570WH42T0C,my niece love it
R311E01PJUUXT,good value
RSPTVAM199HML,a lot of pens make it an okay buy.
RSPTVAM199HML,"not quite as special as the commercial promises, so there was a bit of sixyearold disappointment, but they work well as regular pens."
R2T6HKXABAM3P8,love it!
R2T6HKXABAM3P8,it looks so real!
R3R4CW28HVZJ5G,great product

R1HJYEKXUVUO71,i repainted her and turned her into olivia benson from law & order svu
R3L1STQFPI2U8Q,bought this drone for my husband on his birthday.
R3L1STQFPI2U8Q,he enjoyed playing with it for a few days then one of the rotor broke and one of the batteries stopped charging.
R233IN7WMMJNSL,"i liked the drone, but i couldnt get it to stay bound to the transmitter ."
R233IN7WMMJNSL,when i released the throttle to return to the center it would drop the binding and shut down.
R233IN7WMMJNSL,i could not get it to stay.
R1U7ADU541GAAP,"my granddaughters love this, especially the younger at less than a year."
R1U7ADU541GAAP,i bought this along with various other little people sets but its a real favorite.
R1U7ADU541GAAP,"yes, adults may hate the song but i dont because my granddaughter loves it so."
R1U7ADU541GAAP,the cow and chicken make their animal noises when placed correctly and theres an engine sound when the farmer is put in the drivers seat.
R1U7ADU541GAAP,"sounds are easy to press even for a little one, and the vehicle rolls very easilythe 11 month old pushes it easily."
RUS0PVH5Q5AW4,fun thing to show but careful as the handle doesnt seem like it can hold up to the job for long.
RUS0PVH5Q5AW4,"used it on one bottle thus far, worried to push my luck."
RUS0PVH5Q5AW4,granted you can separate the opener from the screwdriver but then whats the point?
R30K95FBZOLVUK,i had to put a hair tie on it to hold it from slapping up against the axle every time i turned it
R4V9MVESEBUJH,"if your child already knows how to use the ipad, i would not recommend getting this."
R4V9MVESEBUJH,it is slower and has less options than an ipad which can be frustrating to kids.
R4V9MVESEBUJH,"on the plus side, it is sturdy and there are some fun games on it."
RJENZ5DEHQNI8,"really, really super fun concept."
RJENZ5DEHQNI8,the helicopter is a little tricky to use.
RJENZ5DEHQNI8,the sam station keeps you on your toes when in auto mode.
RJENZ5DEHQNI8,overall pretty cool.
RHNC440PKMSV2,i love this thing!
RHNC440PKMSV2,its perfect for setting out on the table before a house party and letting the conversations begin.
RHNC440PKMSV2,its quite heavy and substantial.
RHNC440PKMSV2,a musthave for any bitcoin enthusiast.
R1ZHZ05VO9ERML,do not be swayed by the posted size of this hand held game product dimensions 1.8 x 7.5 x 10.2 inches  8 ounces.
R1ZHZ05VO9ERML,"the packaging may be that big, but the product is most certainly not."
R1ZHZ05VO9ERML,although i do like the game its small size is totally not what i was looking for.
R2RAOMPGRGRZMV,"ignore the people saying its too small, its too small, its standard figuarts size."
R2RAOMPGRGRZMV,"these people are just the typical idiots who pop up in the review section for pretty much every figuart.anyways, the figure is fantastic, great sculpt, lots of accessories, and plenty of possability."
R2RAOMPGRGRZMV,"the only complaint that i have is that shes not quite as possable as she could be, shes got quite a few single joints, but shes still plenty possable."
R1FLJR02DSYRLZ,fun to play
RT9L3T62GP5KA,we purchased these for the kids table at our daughters peppa themed party and they were a hit.

RT9L3T62GP5KA,i am happy with the purchase and the result.
R1MIY7HBGIGEP8,like

R2IR7S28AAGL3H,!
R3RHGWD3SOG02W,i love the six million dollar man.
R2DROWF11F08FN,"well, if youre into agile projects and have planning sessions, these can be helpful."
R2DROWF11F08FN,"these sorts of planning cards are useful when youre first starting out but honestly, they arent needed once youre all ramped up and clear on what youre trying to do."
R2DROWF11F08FN,"you can rate story points or work size using just about anything like sticky notes.none the less, these look more professional than hand written sticky notes using crayon, so if youre up for it, you can use these."
RZNSMZL03QXIR,my six year old son loves this set!
RZNSMZL03QXIR,he likes the domino placer and the rocket and also the airplane is great.
R1J8QR8X6XWBRA,"bought it for my son and it arrived quickly, with a slightly oily layer, which was easy to wipe off with a towel."
R1J8QR8X6XWBRA,"this is a sturdy cube for a 5x5x5, and it rotates nicely."
R1J8QR8X6XWBRA,i was worried it would be cheap or flimsy...not at all!
R1J8QR8X6XWBRA,very pleased with my purchase!

R13ZSATQDRLBIR,its so great that the kit can make 3 different things.
R13ZSATQDRLBIR,so many lego kits are only designed to do one thing.
R13ZSATQDRLBIR,i love that this can be 3 different things.
R13ZSATQDRLBIR,this is a great price point for birthday parties too!
RMB7OAKTUXS1Q,it broke apart almost at once.
RMB7OAKTUXS1Q,it was very poorly made and not as high as my original one.

R8TNOV30Q9372,"one of my rooks also arrived chipped, but i dont mind."
R8TNOV30Q9372,"clearly a product designed on the cheap, but well executed all considering."
RABO1Q0Z876Z3,"it flew without effort... i just litterally took it out, let the wind carry it, and off it goes.."

R1KE4QMU3QGGLG,how could you not give this game 5 stars?
R1KE4QMU3QGGLG,its great for getting together with all the terrible people in your life and making terrible jokes!
R3UN9ZR5ADGUJ1,"imaginext is pretty fun stuff, but this particular piece offers limited play options."
R3UN9ZR5ADGUJ1,theres just not enough going on.
R3UN9ZR5ADGUJ1,i think youd have to invest in a few more pirate pieces to do much with it.
R3UN9ZR5ADGUJ1,"still, its well built and sturdy so it should last."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"when i walked into my lhs which has a large off road track, i asked the guy behind the counter about what would be fun to run behind my house and competitive at the track."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,being a newbie to the rc world i wasnt looking to spend alot of money.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,they had some less expensive short course trucks and naturally asked about them first.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"he told me if i was just looking to bash in the backyard the 200$ sc they sold would be a great truck, if i was looking to race then the team associated sc10rs would be a better choice."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the guy said he been doing rc for 30 years.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i asked if i bought this could i just drop it on the track and be competitive?
R62KLCTL2PKCO,he assured me i could.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"my brother and i both bought this truck that day, his the rock starmakita version mine this very toyota."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,we raced with them stock a week later and even though we were complete noobs we still placed better than last against guys running hopped up losis and 200$ transmitters.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"after some rigorous practice and new tires that better fit the track, im now running mid pack, slowly moving up every week, well my brother has taken 2 first place finishes in the 3 weeks weve raced."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,im confident with time ill be in the front of the pack and my truck is not what is holding me back.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i catch everyone in the straight and can turn as tight as anything out there.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i run 5300ma 40c lipo batteries.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i recommend at least 40 c battery as this car definitely shows an improvement in punch on the 40c over a 30c battery.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,running less than a 30c battery will overstress the battery and definitely effect performance.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the guy at the shop said more than a 40c battery wont show a performance boost or a very negligible one.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,sounds believable since he make more if he sold me a more expensive higher c battery.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,as far as durability is concerned ive smashed this thing in every way conceivable.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"i did manage to rip the rear a arm off after about 4 weeks of running this thing to the hilt, and the lexon body cracked alot in the rear, but some gorilla tape fixed that right up."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the rear a arms at my local track were only 7$ a set for the oem ones.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,besides that this thing has taken a beating and kept going.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,ive cycled multiple batteries through it in a row with out cool down time.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the motor hasnt shown any loss of performance.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i try to let it cool down now between runs since talking to experienced guys who told me running more than 10 minutes straight can damage a rc motor.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the 5300ma lipos batteries last easily 20 minutes running close to wide open or wide open about 50 of the time on the track.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the battery cut off has always left 6 volts in my pack.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i definitely wouldnt want to run them any lower since everything ive read online says 6v is ok but theirs alot of debate about anything lower and most agree its probably damaging your pack going lower.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"the stock shell does suffer from ""parachuting"" when going off large jumps."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,since the track i run on is set up for 18 buggy and truggy both electric and nitro the jumps are huge.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,you can hit most of them but it takes precise lining up and getting hard on the throttle as soon as possible.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the truck is light enough that even though its only rear wheel drive you do have a fair amount of control using the throttle and brake to adjust your angle mid air.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,assuming that a strong wind doesnt come along and flip you over mid air or cause you too levitate.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,from what ive seen everyone either cuts holes in their body or most just use flo tech bodies to negate this issue.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"the stock body seems fine as long as its not windy, it is very predictable."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,at the last race i went to it had rained hard for a few hours prior to race start.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the track was muddy and not just regular mud but muddy clay.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,durring qualifying my truck started having serious performance issues and at one point i watched it come through a left turn and as it rolled out i noticed the front left wheel dipped deep into the chassis at the apex of the corner.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i thought i had blown a shock.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,after the race i picked up my car and it weighed nearly twice its normal weight.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the entire inside of the shell and the rest of the truck from the rear end through the front suspension was caked in mud.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the fan on the esc was even burried and not spinning.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,well i cleaned it out with brushs the best i could but i still felt it was heavier than it should be.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the fan came back to life though.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,on my 2nd race i noticed it still was not performing as well as it should and caked up again before it was over.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,so this time i just took it over to the hose and sprayed the whole truck out.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"yeah im nuts, but you know what i let it dry till the next heat, popped a battery in it and it still worked like nothing happened."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"i took care not to spray directly into seals on the rear end, electronics, and survo."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,im not saying that you should hose your car right out like i did but i am saying that i did it and the car didnt skip a beat.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"i cant say that i have alot of experience with short course trucks, the only other truck i have is a hpi blitz that i got a great deal on used."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i can tell you though from my experience this sc10rs has hop ups from the factory that are needed and none that it doesnt.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,it has aluminum shocks and a brushless motor which everyone agrees if you have a standard sc10 are 2 of the first things you should get.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"the survo in it is also fairly strong, and quick."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,its not the most amazing thing you can buy but from what ive learned from other sc guys is it is the best survo that comes in any brand sc rtr.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"also the transmitter, will not a 100$ or 200$ unit does feel smooth and has all the adjustment knobs you need."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,mine came with the new style with the knobs on top so did my brothers.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,"also like i said earlier, my brother is running this thing full stock minus tires and that includes the transmitter and is laying a hurting on guys with mush more expensive equipment."
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the only downside ive really seen with this truck is its transmission is loud compared to the blitz which hasfull metal gears and is filled with gear oil.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the sc10s gears are mostly plastic and only runs a semi sealed designed.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i dont believe this was done to save cost.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the blitz weighs considerably more because of that full metal tranny which effects everything from acceleration to how will it jumps.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,ive had zero problems with the rear end in the sc10 and i beat on it as hard as i want.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,so plastic gears or not they hold up well.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,this is just a well built racer using metal only where it is absolutely crucial for durability.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the only thing i upgraded were the wheel hexes in the back to aluminum ones.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,i chewed up my plastic ones running with the wheels lose and not realizing it.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,they also make wheel changing easier cause they lock onto the axle where as the plastic ones were only held in place by the wheel and tended to get stuck in the rim when the wheel was removed.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,its a hop up for convenience more than anything and adds very little weight.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,oh and i should mention the esc will come loose on you if you run this thing hard as you should.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,the factory applied double sided tape is garbage.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,we bought scotch brand double sided outdoor rated tape and nothing has broken loose since.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,we also use it for our transponders.
R62KLCTL2PKCO,get that and some gorrilla tape for reinforcing the shell if it cracks and youll be all set.
R1ZO2H947XR8R1,i have yet to be disappointed
RNZ619NOX6VHN,purchased this for my 6 year old grandson who lives out of state.

R1GJ9BUM4U8CQV,itachis details are very nicely covered.
R1GJ9BUM4U8CQV,"the cold look,the colors of the akatsukis cloak, the sharingan in the eyes etc... it looks exactly as the picture is shown."
R1GJ9BUM4U8CQV,only thing is its a little bigger than usual key chains and in the picture it looks a little smaller its not a problem its an observation but its very nice looking so that should not be a problem as it just makes it more conspicuous.all and all a very worth the buy.
R3UCGB8BSVIZZ2,"a quick, fast pace game."
R3UCGB8BSVIZZ2,some strategy some luck.

RZJRTIZIP4Y3H,this is a great toy that can be used multiple ways!
R1VJ6V3EPOF729,"first off, the hull is not blue  my kid picked this toy specifically because of its blue hull."
R1VJ6V3EPOF729,"its gray, the same color as the superstructure."
R1VJ6V3EPOF729,"then, the base of the screw that holds the cabin to the hull disintegrated after the first use, so the cabin  which doubles as the battery compartment lid  could not be reattached."
R1VJ6V3EPOF729,superstructure decals peeled off after the first contact with water.
R1VJ6V3EPOF729,the prow gun barrel broke after the first minutes of use.
R1VJ6V3EPOF729,"it leaks, so water gets into the battery compartment immediately, but the motor keeps running, surprisingly."
R1VJ6V3EPOF729,this is probably the worst quality toy i ever got my hands on.
R1VJ6V3EPOF729,"on the bright side, its only $7 and most of the toys fall out of favor after the first use anyway, so the loss does not feel so dramatic."
R1VJ6V3EPOF729,"as i am writing this, my 4 year old keeps fiddling with it, apparently he likes it even if its not blue, so its not a total disaster."
R1FLINBPEF12YR,great party item!
R23X450LUHENEJ,coconuts by mayday games is a game every family should have.

R23X450LUHENEJ,you fling coconuts into cups and collect those cups and coconuts.
R23X450LUHENEJ,"we love dexterity games, getting to hit or swing items is just plain fun."
R23X450LUHENEJ,coconuts is a game everyone can enjoy.
R23X450LUHENEJ,if your kid is to young to actually play.
R23X450LUHENEJ,they can just practice flinging the coconuts into the cups.
R23X450LUHENEJ,"however, you dont even need to know how to read to play this game."
R3HGDWWYV95R14,this is an amazing bath toy!
R3HGDWWYV95R14,"we love the idea of it being made out of recycled milk jugs, and the quality is unbeatable."

R1GP6XKW687QZ4,"my first reaction when that came in the mail was... ""lets hope its not crap"" fortunately, it was amazing."
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,i was quick to make a video on it too!
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,this is great for cosplay and display!
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,though here is a few warnings before anyone buys this product.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,if you think it might be a slight bit metal or wood... its not.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,it is fully plastic and the blade is thin and flimsy.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,it will go out fine but you have to push it back in.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,in case you didnt know same goes for the bow.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,the bow part is just fine.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,"still, made of plastic."
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,and the gauntlet itself isnt very adjustable.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,you have to have a wide wrist for it to properly fit.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,like in the games other than those things the product is amazing.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,and i wont stop saying amazing because the word intrigues me.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,i suggest buying this product for halloween.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,or any other dress up occasion.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,its not fit for real action.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,of course.
R1GP6XKW687QZ4,i love it.
R2WX845RYNHI9F,you will need to help your child put this together and be careful cutting out the pieces any extra plastic will affect the gears.
R2WX845RYNHI9F,i used a nail file to smooth everything down.
R2WX845RYNHI9F,its complicated
R3K4GSN21M3THA,"a really great game, easy to play and teach though it may seem daunting at first glance, its really not."
R3K4GSN21M3THA,"also, inexpensive as games go, at least until you start going for all the expansion sets."
R3K4GSN21M3THA,"the base game is a good solid start thatll keep you playing for quite a while, since there are 25 &34kingdom&34 cards from which you use only 10 per game, so the number of variations is pretty good.the thing to note about dominion is, depending on what kingdom cards are in a given game, sets the stage for the strategy."
R3K4GSN21M3THA,"different strategies work in most cases, but part of the game is figuring out what will be the best strategy to choose given what kingdom cards are available to buy in that particular game."
R3K4GSN21M3THA,this also increases the replay value since you wont always be using the exact same strategy every game.
R3K4GSN21M3THA,"and picking combinations of kingdom cards to play that work together to give you extra benefits is really fun to pull off.dont let the massive number of cards intimidate you the core part of the game of the kingdom cards, youre only using 10 at a time, though therell be a bunch of copies of each which makes it look a lot more complex than it really is."
R3K4GSN21M3THA,i taught it to a friend who within a couple of turns had it figured out and she ended up beating me using a kingdom card that i had been previously ignoring because it didnt seem that powerful the cellar she saw the value of it where i didnt and ended up winning.
R3K4GSN21M3THA,a very fun game.
R3K4GSN21M3THA,"if in doubt, try the online version, you can play the base game for free.one thing to note the base game will play 24. and as a 2player its excellent."
R3K4GSN21M3THA,you can go up to 8 players by combining the original set with intrigue but i hear when going over 4 players it tends to bog down somewhat.
R3K4GSN21M3THA,"i bought intrigue because we do have 5 in our game group now and then, but havent had a chance yet to figure out how good it is with 5, ill probably try it but with a group of more than 5id probably either divide them up into two games also possible with the intrigue set, or even just by adding the basecard set.all in all, a totally awesome game."
R2R34HQHUM3U7U,exactly as stated

R2G6CZ0UHSJ140,great fit for my 4yr old!
R34G5D28N84X70,"just as i had imagined, i am able to put myself in the place of a fine classical painter, jacqueslouis david in the romanticism style.i chose napoleon crossing the alps also known as napoleon at the saintbernard pass or bonaparte crossing the alps, because it is a complex composition depicting a pivotal moment of sublime metaphoric power and a grandiose version of a highly idealized seminal moment where napoleon commands his place in the annals of history.being as the original was commissioned by the then king of spain and several versions were made, i feel entitled to paint my own version proudly placing my own countenance in the place of napoleons."
R34G5D28N84X70,"when my own travails seem more than i can bear, i will take heart and majestically push onward and cross that metaphoric pass on my bounding steed... as my cat, sparklefarts will now be nicknamed.you might wonder, if she likes it so much why only 3 stars?"
R34G5D28N84X70,and you would be correct in assuming something was indeed amiss.the canvas received was not stapled onto wooden stretchers!
R34G5D28N84X70,the box contained a folded piece of canvas that i have to have staple to wooden stretchers that ill have to purchase!
R34G5D28N84X70,drat!
R34G5D28N84X70,confounded dashed hopes!!!
R34G5D28N84X70,i have more problem solving with which to cope.

R1ZK90WLO5AOO5,it is so small.
R1ZK90WLO5AOO5,my daughter put the stick right in her mouth and i was so afraid she would choke.
R1ZK90WLO5AOO5,this is definitely not for 6 months and older.
R1ZK90WLO5AOO5,it looks very cheap as well not like the nice toy i was expecting from the picture and normal price.
R1ZK90WLO5AOO5,"i must admit, my daughter likes it but i am scared to let her play unattended."
R1ZK90WLO5AOO5,"luckily, i received this product in exchange for my fair and honest review, as i would be very upset had i paid full price for this."
R2MCJ50WQ8TDMS,my daughter is obsessed with mustaches so i knew this kit would be great for her.
R2MCJ50WQ8TDMS,"it doesnt make a ton of stuff and the quality is soso, but she has had fun with it."
RGXVIOTC1F8MS,works well
ROQ4LBHNXK3GG,"do not buy fir your family.no shelf box and no repair kit.came with dried mud, dirt footprints, grass clippings and dead bugs.just wow."

R15I6GH106QZPA,a gift for my husband.
R15I6GH106QZPA,he loves it!
R1CASYOJ7PQMMS,"personally, i feel that this is way overpriced for what we got."
R1CASYOJ7PQMMS,i thought it would be better quality hence why i spend the money.
R1CASYOJ7PQMMS,"the scissors dont kil personally, i feel that this is way overpriced for what we got."
R1CASYOJ7PQMMS,i thought it would be better quality hence why i spend the money.
R1CASYOJ7PQMMS,the scissors are awful.
R1CASYOJ7PQMMS,"the colored pencils break constantly, the markers are ok except they form excess the markers are ok except they form excess build up on the ends that you have to pull off it was actually a lot smaller than i expected too!"
R1CASYOJ7PQMMS,i couldve bought cindarella staff individually with a cinderella case and spent a third of the money i did i couldve bought cindarella staff individually with a cinderella case and spent a third of the money i did on this

R1V2T54W5M10IR,"messy hair, not smooth like the others."
R2RKU927CY6ZEU,yes and very fast delivery
RDMV52AZDFFRA,she loves it thank you
R1QLG5E4192XKU,these air hogs smash bots were put the test by my 9 year old daughter and then her 13 year old brother had to jump in to challenge her.
R1QLG5E4192XKU,"the concept sounds cool, the reality ok but not quite as cool.first off  10 aaa batteries required between the 2 sets of robotscontrollers batteries not included."
R1QLG5E4192XKU,thats alot of aaa batteries  to appease the angry mob i was able to scrounge up enough aaas after cannibalizing various devices around the house.
R1QLG5E4192XKU,once batteries loaded and units operational my kids headed into battle.
R1QLG5E4192XKU,basically the remote controllers let you have your robot spin its arms to the left or the right  the turbo wheel makes them spin faster.
R1QLG5E4192XKU,no walking function except the spinning does cause the robot to creep around the floor  spin away and try and knock the other robot over.
R1QLG5E4192XKU,for whatever reason my daughter seemed to win more often than her big bro as expected he blamed his robot as being inferior.
R1QLG5E4192XKU,i was actually impressed with build quality  rugged plastic beefed up to better survive physical combat.what could be better remote controls have weak signal and the kids needed to be within a few feet of the robots to consistently control the robots.
R1QLG5E4192XKU,replayability  my kids got pretty bored of this pretty fast  they quit playing after an hour and havent tried again since.
R1QLG5E4192XKU,thus im going to say ideal ages are younger than 9. functionality  would be more fun to have more controllable features on the robots  some type of controllable mobility.
R1QLG5E4192XKU,"perhaps a nerf rocket you could launch remotely.in summary  good build quality, takes too many batteries, limited ability to control robots, replayability probably best for kids under 9. at $50 current price kinda pricey considering all these factors though around the same price of a new release video game if you think of it that way  overall rating from me is 3stars in consideration of pricevalue."
R3THCSJKQHW492,"keychain arrived very quickly10 days after purchase, and is of good quality."
R3THCSJKQHW492,"this is not an official product, judging by the packagings lack of any copyright relating to jojos bizarre adventure and the hastilycropped image used for the packaging art."
R3THCSJKQHW492,"the keychain itself is of fantastic quality though, made of a solid metal.halderthe companys name is embedded on the charms backs, which are unpainted."
R3THCSJKQHW492,"the characters themselves look fantastic, and the only minor complaint i have is that polnareffs tanktop is pink on the keychain, when in the show its a dark blueblack."
R3THCSJKQHW492,"other than that, its a solid 5 stars."
RZYQODX3RVYWZ,ok
RQBGSGEHDFMK,"thanks for the gorgeous, just best looking clawdeen yet, purple is an awesome color for that beauty!"

R2GSVJMG7SVB7S,did not look or feel anything like the picture.
R2GSVJMG7SVB7S,they werent even knit.
R2GSVJMG7SVB7S,they were cloth.
R12TW7NUNJOPG0,this is a cute little fellow.
R12TW7NUNJOPG0,not quite as nice as the ganz signature lion which seems to be unavailable now.
R12TW7NUNJOPG0,still it is a good choice.
R12TW7NUNJOPG0,it was sent in a box that was too shallow and arrived pretty squashed.
R12TW7NUNJOPG0,no matter.
R12TW7NUNJOPG0,it was shipped several weeks faster than the promised shipping date.
R12TW7NUNJOPG0,all things considered i was quite happy with it.
R3MB7QYDECJ0YY,missing 10 sticks.

RSRFVKI5QSP3A,"these are super adorable, comfortable, and light."
RSRFVKI5QSP3A,the only problem is you have to be careful because they can break easily.
R1VD63A4G7X8LE,none
R3EH8NTNSRG9HX,i bought the full chart for my kids but being that theyre different ages i needed different supplements.
R3EH8NTNSRG9HX,"i give these packs a ""meh"" a lot of the items are repetitive, and i find it irritating that i had to buy two different packs just to make the chart work for ages 3 and 7. they would be doing well to make a family type pack that has stuff like ""do your home work"" then a few chores for little guys and a few chores for bigger guys."
R3EH8NTNSRG9HX,i know you can write your own but i wanted the pictures for the little one to have something to equate with a star at his level.
R3EH8NTNSRG9HX,over all though its a good system.
R1YLOASEL3Y6M3,its all in here.
R1YLOASEL3Y6M3,easy!

R3BNQ38D1F3EN7,great price!
R3BNQ38D1F3EN7,the tape doesnt always tare well but my 2 & 3 year old like large pieces anyway.
R3BNQ38D1F3EN7,i bought this for a 6 hour plane ride and it worked!!
R3BNQ38D1F3EN7,it was easy to peel off the seats and windows but kept them occupied.
R3BNQ38D1F3EN7,great cheap arts and crafts activity!
R26ZVGRYEZ8Z4D,my nephew love it.
R3B7QXXHK857S2,awesome

R3T1PDZAUR5HDW,its just awesome.
R1AA0YBICAU81W,my grandson goes for these as soon as he walks in the door.
R13TWDAXGBOL0I,this kit is a great idea.
R13TWDAXGBOL0I,there is a supply of paper and some markets for preparing a book.
R13TWDAXGBOL0I,"once complete, the drawings are sent to crayola who return one hardcover book with additional copies available to order."
R13TWDAXGBOL0I,its a fun way summer project and way to get kids thinking about how to frame and tell a story.
R13TWDAXGBOL0I,"there is a limited number of pages so some parental help is advisable in setting up the story, especially for older kids who may want to tell a longer story."
R13TWDAXGBOL0I,my own kid stalled out a bit in writing.
R13TWDAXGBOL0I,"the idea of having a finished, printed book does lead to a lot more thinking about what should go in there."
R13TWDAXGBOL0I,it may require some extra guidance but its a great project that inspires a ton of creativity.

R1B3T0ECDMGL9O,it is very well made.
R3PT94S2FIWVXF,the kids love this game!
R21GRDPQ0353AJ,"this was suppose to be 9"" tall it is well under8""  strings not attached and are just hanging loose."
R21GRDPQ0353AJ,it is poorly made and i would not recommend this to anyone.
R393WQ3C8SVB6R,so cute and funny.
R393WQ3C8SVB6R,got it as a random gift for my boyfriend since he got me a lumpy space princess.

R393WQ3C8SVB6R,the stubby legs are the best part
R1C86F0SY5EEBE,cant say anything bad about these.
R1C86F0SY5EEBE,they compare to the atom pulse in gumminess and responsiveness.
R1C86F0SY5EEBE,"ive ridden over sticks, pebbles, rocks, debris ridden concrete, grating and everything else i can find to test out the durability of these."
R1C86F0SY5EEBE,so far so good!
R1C86F0SY5EEBE,definitely a good outdoor quad wheel.
R1KE2CBQM8XYE,great

R2KC69K1DKOF45,plenty of room.
R3P50HKG23CEL3,we have gotten hours of entertainment out of this game.
R3P50HKG23CEL3,i got it for my boyfriend who is an avid marvel and board game fan.
R3P50HKG23CEL3,the game is very easy to get the hang of and you will soon find yourself wanting all of the expansions.
R3P50HKG23CEL3,i have seen the dc version of this game being played and the marvel one just seems so much better.
R3P50HKG23CEL3,very satisfied with it.
R1XW99P4B9MQO6,arrived safely and in perfect condition.
R1XW99P4B9MQO6,the only thing is that the item is not a terrycloth towel.
R1XW99P4B9MQO6,"instead, it is more like thin cloth like whats used in fabric scrolls i had planned on using the towel when i workout, so i cant do that, but its still really cute!"
R31SDBLG1EMNGX,very realistic for what it is loved all of the pieces they still look great.
RA4X6KWDR08V5,cute game for a kids party!
R1TAD825Q38I50,granddaughter turned 3  this was fine at first but she quickly lost interest.
R1TAD825Q38I50,would not recommend.
R1LKHTP741K349,my husband bought this game for my birthday.
R1LKHTP741K349,we played with 6 of our friends at a restaurant and had so much fun.
R2QEOZ42OETS0,i love this puppet!
R2QEOZ42OETS0,it reminds me of the hermit crab i had as a child.
RTYT3CD96VNE0,was a favorite toy of my sons from age 3 to 6. he couldnt do it by himself for a long time but loved it all the same.
R3UDMAPWX1KZ1E,"great set, wish it wasnt retired."
R3PO2RDPM531GM,"nice and sturdy, easy to put together."
R3PO2RDPM531GM,"our grandkids 13 love it, and the 9 and 10 year olds enjoy ""helping"" by playing with all the animalsbarnfeeding, etc."
R3PO2RDPM531GM,works well for more than one child to play at the same time.
R27EEQ2S3ZMRWS,good all in one concept for children.
R27EEQ2S3ZMRWS,"could be a little sturdier, but thats a small criticism."
R3O6B2CB89IK06,the was a gift to my 42 year old niece  delivered to her on the day she had surgery.
R3O6B2CB89IK06,"she loves it and fines it so soft and cuddly and comforting while dealing with all the ""feel bad"" that goes with surgery."
R3O6B2CB89IK06,"great for anyone looking for a very soft, adorable, cuddle pal at any age!"
R29827ITP82YDG,good item for the price its being offered.
R29827ITP82YDG,would like it to includr at least an extra pair of handles as replacement and maybe 1 player of each team so if it breaks.
R1S74D883TO737,"the police range rover arrived broken for me, and it honestly took me a bit to care to fix it without having to return it."
R1S74D883TO737,"the problem was the motor was improperly set when it was manufactured so i had to put it back into place and snap the plastic housing that holds it together to spin a wheel.after that was all said and done, this toy takes 3xaa batteries to power some lights and a motor to have the car drive, bump into something then change directions to bump into something else."
R1S74D883TO737,the police siren is loud and the toy itself is pretty simple.
R1S74D883TO737,im disappointed in this specific car as it looks pretty cheap and seems overpriced at $30.
R1S74D883TO737,i recently reviewed another techege police toy that transformed and that at least did something more interesting where my daughter enjoyed playing with it.
R1S74D883TO737,this toy does not drive on carpet well so unless you have mostly hardwoodtile floors you wont get much out of it.i received this complimentary free police range rover for testing and my unbiased and honest review.
RLBRQW5LH40VF,ordered this for my son and he likes it.
R19IM9WB3C9MH2,we bought this for my 8 year old son.
R19IM9WB3C9MH2,he loves it!
R19IM9WB3C9MH2,"he can do it mostly by himself, but sometimes needs a little guidance."
R19IM9WB3C9MH2,"after he finishes building something, the look of pride on his face is priceless!"
R19IM9WB3C9MH2,well worth the money.
R19IM9WB3C9MH2,we plan to buy him the larger set once the novelty of this one wears off which i am thinking will take some time!.
R19IM9WB3C9MH2,great way to incorporate education into play!
R2HAPD6VO1TCBL,3 year old grandson loves this ball and we are ever thankful it came already blown up!
